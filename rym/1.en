God is always in control.
Once when giving a retreat for a group of college students, I met a young woman from Korea. She shared a story with us of a harrowing experience that happened in her native country when she was about thirteen years old.
She was a passenger on a bus that was speeding along the side of a mountain. The road had sharp curves and no guardrails. Everyone on that bus was panicking, except for one young boy, fast asleep, in the row ahead of her.
“Wake up,” the girl said to him. “We’re going so fast. We’re in great danger. Aren’t you afraid?” The little boy looked up and said, “No, I’m not afraid. The bus driver is my father.” Now, that’s trust!
There used to be a bus company slogan that said, “Take the bus, and leave the driving to us.” God says something similar to us: “Put your life in my hands, and then let me lead you!”
Our Lady experienced situations we could describe as “out of control,” or at least out of her immediate control. But instead of panicking, she turned the situations over to God and trusted him to take care of them.
For example, when St. Joseph realized that Mary was “with child” and did not know how the child had been conceived, he was considering divorcing her quietly. This had to have been a trial for Mary, as it was for Joseph. She realized his anguish over her pregnancy, yet she did not attempt to “resolve the crisis” on her own. She trusted that God would resolve it for her earthly spouse. She did not give way to fear or panic. Like St. Joseph, who was considering prayerfully what to do in the situation, Our Lady prayed that the Lord might intervene. And he did!
An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a Son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:20-21)
Another situation that was out of Mary’s control was King Herod’s attempt to kill the child Jesus. In the face of Herod’s cruelty, Our Lady placed herself and the child Jesus under St. Joseph’s loving care. She followed the directions given to her spouse by an angel in a dream: “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt” (Matthew 2:13). There was no panic, no fear. Our Lady knew that God was in control, not Herod. The conviction of her trust was that nothing can ever happen unless God either wants it or permits it! That same conviction must be ours.
A third example of a situation seemingly out of control for Mary was the loss of the young Jesus in the temple for three days. This was, no doubt, a source of much sorrow and concern for Mary. She even admitted as much when she addressed Jesus: “Son, why have you done this to us? Did you not know that your father and I would search for you in great sorrow?” (see Luke 2:48). Mary and Joseph were concerned for Jesus’ well-being and safety, since he had been specially entrusted to their care. It was their confidence in God’s good purposes that allowed Mary and Joseph to continue their search until Jesus was found.
When Jesus at times tests our trust in him by seeming to be “lost,” let us allow the example of Mary and Joseph to encourage us. The situation may seem to be out of our control, but it is always under God’s total control.
Abandoning Our Burdens to the Lord
Only Jesus can restore our peace.
Hannah, a woman in the Old Testament, is an excellent role model for how to get real with God as we try to carry the burdens that are robbing us of Christ’s peace.
Hannah was one of Elkanah’s two wives. Because of her childlessness, Hannah was taunted by Elkanah’s other wife. Although Elkanah tried to comfort Hannah with his love and provision, Hannah was miserable, weepy, and did not eat (1 Samuel 1:7).
So what did Hannah do with this all-consuming, peace-stealing grief? One year, during her husband’s annual trek to the temple at Shiloh, Hannah went into the temple herself for a firsthand encounter with God. So dramatically did she pour out her heart to God that Eli, the priest in attendance, accused her of being drunk!
After Hannah explained the reason for her sadness and told him of her prayer for a child, Eli was convinced that she was not drunk—except with grief. Then he said an amazing thing to her: “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him” (1 Samuel 1:17). Even more amazing than what Eli said is what Hannah did. She changed her attitude and embraced the peace that Eli had offered her.
Hannah’s encounter with God in the temple marks the height of conflict in her life story. To the temple she brings her greatest burden, childlessness, and basically throws it at God’s feet. Then without any tangible proof that God will positively answer her prayer, she walks out, leaving her burden behind. Hannah’s peace is restored, not because God has yet answered her prayer, but because, with the help of Eli, she has handed her burden to God and trusted him with it.
This is good news for those of us who are carrying great burdens! If we are as authentic with God as Hannah was in presenting our burdens to him and then leave them with God in faith and trust, we also can have the peace that Hannah experienced.
St. Teresa of Ávila advised, “Let nothing upset you, let nothing startle you. All things pass; God does not change. Patience wins all it seeks. Whoever has God lacks nothing; God alone is enough.”
And yet, often, worry holds us back. Sometimes in the middle of praying you realize that the thread of your prayers has changed into a knotted string of worries. The weight of responsibilities holds you back too, perhaps especially when there are so many people depending on you.
Yet what if we were to begin to live as if God alone were enough? What would the practical implications be? On our short list would surely be our ability to be more peaceful with the people in our lives. We would be more forgiving because we would be so aware of God’s mercy in our own life. We would not be as needy because God’s love would be enough for us. We would know that in his eyes, we are truly worthy, beautiful, valuable, and capable, and that what we do or how much we have is not who we are. We would be more generous, even in tough times, and misfortunes would not disturb our trust in God.
If we were to live as if God alone were enough, we would tend to all our earthly responsibilities faithfully and yet hold them loosely. Our sense of well-being and security would be stable, and the peace and goodness of that stability would overflow into all our other relationships and into all our responsibilities.
Ask Jesus, who is our peace, to help you to be authentic in your prayers, to abandon your burdens to him, to restore you to peace, both with him and with your situation, and to help you to know that he alone is enough.
God wants to fill, surprise, and lead us daily.
Nowhere else in the Bible than in the Acts of the Apostles will we find a better description of all that the Holy Spirit can do.
Nowhere else do we read so many stories of how the Spirit transformed and empowered ordinary people and sent them into the world as his ambassadors. 
So let’s take a look at some of these stories to learn how the Spirit worked—and how he can work in our hearts today!
Filled with the Spirit. 
St. Luke begins Acts with Jesus’ promise to his apostles: “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you” (Acts 1:8). The apostles may have thought they had all they needed. After all, they had spent three years learning his gospel and even doing their own missionary work. They had been privileged to see the risen Lord after Easter, and spent forty days with him afterward, learning more and more about the kingdom. And they had just spent nine days together, immersing themselves in prayer. What more could they possibly need?
The Holy Spirit, that’s what. Everything up to that point was good and helpful. But despite all they had seen and heard, they still needed the Spirit to come into their hearts and teach them, empower them, and lift them up.
And that’s exactly what happened on the day of Pentecost. Luke tells us that amidst the rushing wind and tongues of flame, “they were all filled with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:4). By saying they were “filled,” Luke is telling us that the apostles experienced a powerful sense of God’s presence. They felt his love. They felt something that did not come from within them, but that was giving them a new understanding of God and a new desire to share his gospel.
Jesus has sent this same Holy Spirit to “fill” us so that we too could come to know God and find a new power to share his gospel. Every one of us can do the work of the Lord because we have the Spirit. So let’s ask him to raise us up and make us into shining witnesses of his love and power.
Surprised by the Spirit. 
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Peter knew that Jesus had come to bring salvation to the Jews. But what was the meaning of a troubling vision that he had while visiting some believers in Joppa (Acts 10:9-26)? In the vision, God commanded him to eat animals that Jews had always considered unclean, telling him: “What God has made clean, you are not to call profane” (10:15). As Peter pondered the vision, three men arrived, sent by a Roman soldier named Cornelius. It seems that Cornelius himself had a vision, in which an angel told him to send for Peter. Urged by the Spirit, Peter went with them to Cornelius’ house, in spite of the fact that the Law of Moses prohibited Jews from associating with Gentiles.
As Peter preached to Cornelius and his household, everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit—just as Peter was at Pentecost. Amazed, Peter declared: “Can anyone with-hold the water for baptizing these people?” (Acts 10:47). So the gospel was not just for Jews after all! Jesus had come to save everyone. Taken by surprise, Peter put aside his own ideas of how God would work. And because of his openness to the Spirit, a new age dawned.
There will be times when the Spirit will surprise us. He may ask us to put aside a longstanding prejudice. He may propel us into a new outreach or ministry in our parish— something we least expected to do. We may find ourselves compelled to finally patch up a wounded relationship. Whatever the situation, we should all keep Peter’s response in mind. May we always be open to the Spirit’s surprises!
Saul of Tarsus was a devout Jew, a Pharisee who followed the law blamelessly (Philippians 3:6). He had witnessed, approvingly, the execution of Stephen and afterward launched a persecution against the Church. But while on the way to Damascus, he was blinded by a heavenly light, and he realized he was actually persecuting Jesus (Acts 9:3). Just as Peter was led to accept Gentiles into the Church, Saul (also called Paul) needed the Holy Spirit to show him that Jesus really was Israel’s Messiah.
But that was just the beginning for Paul. For the rest of his life, he learned how to yield to the Spirit so that he could accomplish “the work” God had in store for him (Acts 13:2). At one point, when he and his companions “tried to go into Bithynia, ... the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them” (16:7). We don’t know how that happened, but somehow Paul and the others sensed God’s leading and followed it.
As he did with Paul, the Holy Spirit wants to do more than fill us with his love and give us his joy. He wants to move us and direct us. God wants his Spirit to be a permanent gift, shaping our hearts and minds even as he guides our steps. He wants to lead us as we go into the world each day. He may show us how to share his love with someone at work. He may give us wisdom as we deal with a challenging situation in our family. He may even send us in a new direction, as he did with Paul, and open a new avenue of ministry for us.
The Book of Acts shows us that God wants to fill us, surprise us, and even lead us day by day. But how does that happen? As we learn how to yield to his Spirit. So here are some simple steps we can all take that will help us sense the Spirit as he moves in our lives.
It sounds so simple, but in our media-saturated world, this can be a real challenge. Cell phones, televisions, tablet computers, and radio stations have made life easier for us. But they have also made life louder and more distracting. It is so important that we spend time every day disconnected from all these devices so that we can reconnect with the Lord. We need to create space in our lives—times of quiet, when we can fix our hearts on Jesus and begin to sense his Spirit.
What good is quieting our hearts if we don’t have anything to focus our attention on? That’s why it’s helpful to spend part of your quiet time filling your mind with the truths of God. You can contemplate the day’s Scripture readings from Mass. You can read part of the Catechism. You can study the life of a saint or the writings of a good spiritual guide. You can even sing hymns that speak of the Lord and his love. There are many options. Just make sure you are focusing on “whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just”—anything that teaches you about life in the kingdom of God (Philippians 4:8).
Keep a journal of your times of prayer. Write down whatever you think may be coming from the Holy Spirit. Even if it sounds ordinary, even if it sounds silly, write it down. It may be just a feeling of love. It may be a new insight into a Scripture passage. It may be an idea about how to care for a friend. It doesn’t matter. Just get into the habit of recording your insights from the Spirit. That will help keep them fresh in your mind.
Try to find two or three opportunities each day when you can stop for a moment, quiet your heart, and sense the Spirit’s presence. Recall what you wrote down in your prayer journal earlier in the day. Do a quick review of the day so far and repent if something pricks your conscience. Or thank the Holy Spirit for helping you in a situation you faced. Get in the habit of listening. Develop a sensitive ear and a sensitive heart. Get into the habit of recording your senses from the Spirit. That will help keep them fresh in your mind.
The Book of Acts doesn’t recount all the “acts” of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit continues to work powerfully today. He is still transforming ordinary human beings into the likeness of Jesus. He is still bringing them together to build up the Church. He is still empowering them to spread the gospel.
So try your best practice these four simple steps. It’s not hard to get into the habit, and the results are well worth the discipline. This kind of trial and error is exactly what the first believers did, and it bore marvelous fruit. Like them, you’ll find the Holy Spirit working wonders in your life.
The Holy Spirit is just as active in people’s lives today as he was two thousand years ago. Still, we can look at our own lives and think: “Nothing that exciting ever happens to me. I don’t see myself being half as effective as all these other people you wrote about.”
Thoughts like these can be quite discouraging—and they are probably not true. To help us gain a better perspective, let’s look at the story of someone who thought the same thing but whose life proved the exact opposite.
As a young Frenchman from a wealthy family, Charles de Foucauld wasted his early years playing the part of a free-spending playboy. But a dramatic conversion experience filled him with so much love for the Lord that he devoted himself to imitating Jesus’ hidden life in Nazareth. After spending a few years in the Holy Land, and after being ordained a priest in 1901, he went to live a solitary life in the Algerian desert. There he spent hours in prayer each day, worked as a manual laborer, and served the impoverished Tuareg people of Tamanrasset.
Charles longed to welcome other men to live with him in community; he even wrote a rule for his anticipated brotherhood. But no one came. As he grew older, he began to mourn his apparently fruitless life. Tragically, he was killed in December 1916 in an anti-French uprising. He had no followers. He brought few, if any, Tuareg people to faith in Christ. And he ended up being murdered by the very people he would love to have cared for. All his energies seemed wasted and his dream unfulfilled.
But then in 1933, God began raising up a group of men and women who had found Charles’ writings and were touched deeply by them. This small gathering called themselves the Little Brothers and Sisters of Jesus, and they dedicated themselves to following the way of life that Charles de Foucauld had written about. Today, small bands of Little Brothers and Sisters are spread throughout the world. Their witness to a life of simplicity and hiddenness in imitation of Jesus is touching the hearts of everyone around them. As it turns out, Charles de Foucauld bore so much more fruit than he ever imagined!
The Fruit of a Changed Heart
The mere existence of the Little Brothers and Little Sisters tells us that God often works in hidden, mysterious ways. It also tells us that no attempt to serve and honor him goes unrewarded.
Like Charles de Foucauld, many of us may feel that the fruit we are bearing is meager. But maybe the fruit we are looking for is not the same fruit that the Spirit is producing in our lives right now. Maybe we are measuring spiritual fruit only in external terms, like the numbers of people we have directly converted or the parish work we are doing. In reality, this kind of fruit is secondary to the first and most important fruit the Spirit bears in us: internal fruit that testifies to a changed heart. Here are three ways that you are probably bearing fruit—and you may not even notice it.
One of the most common—and most comforting—fruits of the Holy Spirit in our lives is that he gives us a deeper confidence in God’s love. It’s a fruit that comes as we receive the Eucharist and know that we are receiving the very Body of Christ, the Bread of life. This fruit also grows every time we sense God’s presence in our prayer. It grows every time a word from Scripture touches our hearts and shows us God’s wisdom, his mercy, or his direction.
We can tell that this fruit is active in our lives when we find ourselves becoming more peaceful as we go about our days. If you are finding that little setbacks and disappointments aren’t bothering you as much as they did a couple of years ago, you can be sure that the Holy Spirit is working in your life. Think about the story of the man who came home to find his children being rowdy. He was faced with a situation that could have set him off, but the Spirit prompted him to go into his room and pray—and he was able to turn the situation around. Whenever you find yourself acting in a similar way, that’s a sign that the Spirit is working in you, teaching you to bear his fruit!
But it’s not just the small things that the Spirit can help us with. Situations like a terminal illness, a broken relationship, or ongoing financial hardship don’t have to rob us of all our hope or trust in God. Yes, these are more challenging. But nothing is too big for the Holy Spirit! Over time, he can teach us the secret of being content in every situation we face (Philippians 4:12).
Another fruit of the Holy Spirit that quietly occurs in our hearts comes as we find ourselves more willing to repent and more willing to forgive.
Repentance almost always carries a negative connotation, but the truth is that it is a magnificent blessing from God. If you have ever felt the need to go to Confession so that you can get freed from guilt, know that it’s the Holy Spirit who put that thought in your mind! It’s also the Spirit who gently moves us to try to resolve divisions in our families or in our friendships. Simple but disarming gestures like saying “I’m sorry” come from the Holy Spirit, who wants to help us live in unity.
The same is true whenever we tell someone: “I forgive you.” These three words have the power to bring almost immediate healing. They can take mountains of guilt and shame off of a person’s heart and replace them with peace and relief. When we are able to forgive someone, we are acting like Jesus. And that is undeniable proof that the Holy Spirit is working in us. Even on those occasions when we can’t yet forgive, the mere fact that we know we should—the mere fact that we want to get to the point of being able to forgive—is a sign that the Spirit is in us, helping us over every hurdle. God rewards every effort to repent and every effort to be his instruments of peace.
The final fruit we want to look at is the fruit of compassion. Scripture tells us to be slow to judge (Luke 6:37). It tells us to be quick to listen and slow to speak (James 1:19). This is the kind of disposition that the Spirit loves to build in our hearts. He loves to teach us to put aside judgmental, condemning thoughts about people we disagree with. He loves to help us walk in another person’s shoes so that we are not so quick to dismiss someone or ignore his or her own perspective and needs.
So if you have found your heart going out to people who are struggling in any way, this is a mark of the Holy Spirit’s work. Perhaps tragic stories in the news that you once skipped over are moving you to pray for an end to violence. Maybe the number of abortions that occur each year in our country is piercing your heart in new ways. Maybe you are finding yourself going out of your way to help a neighbor who is sick or a coworker who is going through a tough time at home. All of these are signs that the Spirit is giving you the heart of Christ—the heart of one who wants to answer the cry of the poor.
Brothers and sisters, we need to know that we really are bearing fruit for the Lord. Every change in your heart, every new attitude, every act of humility and repentance, is a testimony to the fact that the Holy Spirit is at work, shaping you into the image of Christ!
So don’t allow yourself to believe that God has forgotten about you or that his plans for you are small and insignificant. The Holy Spirit is working just as powerfully today as he did in the time of the apostles. We just need to know where to look—inside our own hearts! God really does love us. He really is with us, asking us to yield ourselves to his Spirit. As we do, he will do astonishing things in us. He will change our dispositions, fill us with his love, and equip us to go into the world as his ambassadors. This is a great privilege, and it’s available to all of us—simply because the Holy Spirit dwells in us!
May God bless you this Easter season, and may the day of Pentecost find all of us watching and waiting, ready to receive whatever gifts the Spirit wants to give us.
Reflections on the Ascension
The hope to which we’re called.
On the feast of the Ascension, we are called to rejoice both in Jesus’ victory over sin and death and in the glorious life that he has secured for us. We pray that we would experience the new life that is ours in Christ.
Three aspects of that new life stand out in the Second Mass Reading for the feast: May you know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe (see Ephesians 1:18-19).
As Christians, our hope is secure because it rests in Jesus’ death and resurrection. Because Jesus has overcome sin forever, we can live in freedom and peace, no matter what situations we may face. We have been reconciled to God. We are no longer strangers. Every day, we can live in confidence, knowing that our God is with us to strengthen and comfort us.
Our hope is also founded in the inheritance Jesus won for us—none other than being with our Father forever, knowing him intimately, in all his splendor and beauty. In his ascension, Jesus has opened the door for us. Though we are sinners, we have been forgiven and redeemed. We are now fully loved and accepted as God’s children, and we will live with him forever.
As we live every day in the hope of our eternal inheritance, however, we can begin to taste these blessings here and now. This is part of the “immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe.” Before he returned to his Father, Jesus promised his disciples that anyone who believed in him would be able to cast out demons, heal the sick, and perform signs and wonders in his name (Mark 16:17-18). How? By the power of the Holy Spirit, who lives inside of us. The same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is in our hearts, inviting us to yield to him and empowering us to live in the victory of the resurrection. No challenge is too great for a child of God!
As the disciples watched Jesus being lifted up to heaven, they might have been tempted to feel abandoned, and they might have panicked at seeing their risen Lord leaving the earth, leaving them for good. Now think of a time in your life when you felt as if Jesus had abandoned you. Jesus’ promise of the Holy Spirit—you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit ... [and] you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:5, 8)—is meant for you, too, to bring you comfort and reassurance at just such a time.
Exercise your hope today by calling to mind Jesus’ death and resurrection and the salvation he won for you on the cross. Ask God for a powerful outpouring of his Spirit so that he can manifest his power in your life. Ask the Spirit to help you place your hope and confidence more fully in these truths.
The Holy Spirit takes our “head knowledge” and fills it with his grace.
We know the stories: Adam and Eve; Cain and Abel; Jacob and Esau.
We know the words: “God so loved the world ...;” “Whatsoever you do to the least of my people ...;” “God is love.” We even know the commandments: “You shall not kill;” “Honor your father and mother;” “You shall not covet.”
Because so many of us grew up with these stories and commandments, they have woven themselves into the fabric of our lives. Have you ever noticed, for example, how readily words and phrases from the Bible trip off our tongues? How easy it is to say, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” or “Pride goeth before the fall.”
This is all quite impressive, but in our heavenly Father’s mind, this “formation” aspect of Scripture is just the beginning of what he wants to do through his word. God didn’t create us simply to be upright people with well-ordered lives. He didn’t intend the Bible to be just a rule book to guide us while he watched from afar. He wants to have a relationship with us. He wants to speak to us here and now—and he does it through Scripture.
Unlike any other book ever written, the Bible is “living and active” (Hebrews 4:12). Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Scripture has the power to bring God himself into our lives. Listen, for instance, to Moses as he addresses the Israelites just as they are about to enter the Promised Land. He tells them that the word of God ...
is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away. It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?” Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?” No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart. (Deuteronomy 30:11-14)
God has written his words in our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33), and every time we seek his voice in Scripture, our hearts respond with encouragement, hope, and trust that God truly is with us. As St. Augustine once prayed, “O Lord, you pierced me with your word, and I loved you.”
Many centuries after Moses exhorted the Israelites, one of the psalmists reminded his people about Israel’s checkered history during their desert wanderings:
God had spoken clearly and dramatically to their ancestors on Mount Sinai centuries earlier, and yet this psalmist seems to take it for granted that God wanted to speak to them again “today,” and every day. Clearly, there could be no “today” if God were not still speaking to his people. There could only be “back then,” when God spoke to Moses— or in our case, “back then,” when Jesus walked the earth.
So how do we hear God’s voice today? What can we do to ensure that we come out of prayer or Mass and say with great confidence: “God spoke to me today”? To find an answer, we need look no further than the Book of Psalms, the Bible’s own guide to prayer. At its very outset—the first two verses of the first psalm itself—we see a recipe for hearing God and knowing the blessings of his presence:
The key to hearing God speak to us in Scripture is the art of meditation. It is found in the practice of reading, studying, and dwelling prayerfully on a passage from Scripture until we hear God speaking to us personally through those words.
While it may seem at first as if meditation is free flowing and without any form, experience shows that we do better with a set method or approach to keep us from unfocused wool gathering. Don’t assume that you can meditate on Scriptures when you’re driving your car, running errands, or taking a jog in the park. The more you focus your attention on God, the easier it will be to hear his voice. So choose a time when you are most alert. And find a place that is both comfortable and free from distractions or clutter.
Whatever passage you choose, be careful not to make it too long. The goal of meditation is not to memorize or examine a part of Scripture but to listen to God speak to your heart. And for that, less is more. Many people choose one of the readings from the daily liturgy. Others choose to work slowly through a gospel or a New Testament letter.
Once you have gathered your thoughts and calmed your mind, go ahead and read the passage you have chosen. Take your time. Be deliberate and careful in your reading. Read it over several times until you feel comfortable with what the verses are saying. If you come across a puzzling word or phrase, turn to a commentary or your Bible’s notes for help. But don’t spend too much time on this. Do only what is necessary to resolve any confusion, and then get back to prayer.
Don’t try to force anything in your meditation. Instead, be still and listen for God’s voice. Listen for any impression that these words make. Are they stirring your heart with hope? Are they pointing out an area of darkness that you need to bring into the light of Confession? Are they comforting you or encouraging you or filling you with a sense of gratitude and love? Are they moving you to take some kind of action, whether in dealing with a habit of your own or in helping you with a close relationship?
No matter what God says or how he says it to you, his words will always be accompanied by a sense of immediacy and intimacy. This is not something that we can manufacture. It is a gift we can only receive with gratitude, humility, and love. It comes only as we calm our racing minds and wait to hear what God wants to tell us.
In his 1893 encyclical letter, Providentissimus Deus, Pope Leo XIII wrote, “Sacred Scripture is not like other books. Dictated by the Holy Spirit, it contains things of the deepest importance, which in many instances are most difficult and obscure. To understand and explain such things there is always required the ‘coming’ of the same Holy Spirit; that is to say, his light and his grace” (5).
With these words, Pope Leo taught that when the Holy Spirit opens our eyes and reveals the truths of God , this revelation has the power to change us. The “light and grace” of God open our minds and our hearts to his presence and help us to see him in a new and awe-inspiring light.  As we meditate on Scripture, the Spirit gives us a glimpse of God as he truly is : all-powerful; absolutely holy; and perfectly wise, loving, and just.
St. Jerome, one of the Church’s greatest Scripture scholars, described his experience of the Holy Spirit in Scripture this way:
What food, what honey could be sweeter than to learn of God’s Providence, to enter into his shrine and look into the mind of the Creator, to listen to the Lord’s words at which the wise of this world laugh, but which really are full of spiritual teaching? (Epistle to Paula, 30.13)
For our part, when we read Scripture and meditate upon it prayerfully, we begin to see Jesus as the pearl of great price and the path for our lives (Matthew 13:46; Psalm 119:105). We experience a longing in our heart to stay close to Jesus no matter the cost. All because the Holy Spirit has taken our “head knowledge”—our insights into God—and filled them with his grace. What was once in our minds has moved into our hearts, giving us the joy of knowing Jesus, the peace of experiencing his salvation, and a desire to love God in return for everything he has done for us.
Brothers and sisters, God loves to speak to the deepest part of our hearts. He loves to reveal his truth, confirm his love, and teach us his ways. May we never tire of listening for his voice and receiving his revelation!
“On-Ramps” to Faith
First, Discard False Notions
What’s an on-ramp for?
To bring you to the road that will take you to your destination, of course. Maybe you were once on the right road but left it because you thought another route would be better or easier. Maybe you got lost and drifted from the right road without realizing it. But all that’s over now: you’re ready to reorient yourself and start heading in the right direction.
And that’s easy when you’re on an actual highway in a fast-moving car. It’s more difficult when you’re dealing with things deeper than direction and speed.
The on-ramp that brings us to real faith might be a little longer than we expect. That’s because traveling on it means discarding old and erroneous ideas and replacing them with concepts that are not just true but capable of leading us to ultimate truth. Here’s the goal as we travel these particular on-ramps, and it’s very specific: to learn to see things as they are rather than as the world often thinks they are.
First, we have to understand that we live in a culture that doesn’t just influence what we think—it often determines the way we think. Sometimes it even dictates what is possible to think. Our secular culture’s ideas about religion, and especially about Catholicism, are usually nothing short of toxic. Yet these ideas have been seeping into our minds for a long time—so long that we often don’t even notice how foreign and damaging they are.
A Kind of Sickness
Materialism, the belief that there is nothing more than what meets the eye, is the default position for many. Relativism, the belief that values and morals are grounded in nothing more solid than emotion and personal preference, is taught on most college campuses and is the stuff of every sitcom we watch. Belief in God is considered a relic of the past—an irrational, unreasonable, and even bigoted relic.
All these things add up to a problem, not just for our spiritual lives but for our entire Church. In fact, they add up to a kind of sickness.
We’ve all heard that the Church is a body, the mystical body of Christ. We comprise that body, you and I and countless others. Jesus is always the head, but we—frail and fallible as we are—remain the body. Like all living things, bodies can be invaded by pathogens and become ill. Sometimes those pathogens actually affect the DNA of the body they attack.
In a way, we’re facing a change in the Church’s DNA that results in mutations of important truths and doctrines. Profound religious ideas are flattened out; their holiness is drained away, drop by steady drop. Something that was once overflowing with significance becomes an empty shell.
In our culture—which is sometimes called post-Christian—this mutating process has run deep into the minds of Catholics, and it has affected our understanding of some fundamental concepts. Yet often we’re unaware of these transformations, mistaking mutated forms for the real thing. When that happens, our spiritual lives become deformed. One really basic concept that has undergone a particularly troubling mutation is faith.
Defining Faith
What word could be more basic to our understanding of our relationship to God? Yet what does it really mean?
If we listen to a new atheist like Richard Dawkins, we learn that faith is nothing more than belief without evidence. If we listen to someone who thinks in relativistic terms, we’ll get a definition that is no better and may be worse: “Faith is just one of many possible interpretations of reality, a private belief in some invisible realities that have little or no bearing on how the world works or how you live your life. Faith has and should have no effect on the way you live your life.” It’s a textbook example of how to empty something important of its vibrancy and meaning and leave it ready for the trash heap.
So what does the Church tell us faith is?
Here’s a definition that I borrow from my colleague, Fr. Pierre Ingram: “Faith is what gives us access to the truth. Faith plugs us into God’s understanding of reality. Faith is opening my being to a word that has the power to transform all aspects of my life. Faith puts my entire life at God’s disposal.” Or as Fr. Francis Martin once summed up, “Faith is God’s work in me to which I respond.”
What a difference! Here faith is dynamic, multifaceted, and multidimensional. It’s also profoundly relational and transformational. Faith is not something private that we dream up on our own, and it’s not something arbitrary. In fact, it’s not rooted in us at all! It’s rooted in God and God’s work in us.
That definition differs drastically from the ones the secular world prefers. In the secular world’s mutation, faith is subjective, a personal choice based on ... on what? On whatever we choose to base it on, apparently. It’s disconnected from anything outside us. This kind of “faith” can have no knowledge of the object of faith—God. In the mutation of this word, faith is turned into wishful thinking, a house built on sand. No, it’s even worse than that: it’s a shot in the dark.
Notice something else: it’s very lonely. The relational element of true faith is missing. The idea that God’s presence can have an effect in our lives isn’t there. In the mutated idea of faith, each one of us is alone, hoping against hope for whatever might seem best to hope for. And that’s not a great place to be.
Faith Is Man’s Response to God
Look at yet another definition of faith. The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that faith is “man’s response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life” (26).
Do you notice a theme? In Fr. Martin’s definition, we learned that faith is “God’s work in me to which I respond.” The Catechism tells us that faith is “man’s response to God.” In both these definitions, faith is an answer to something that comes from outside us and beyond us.
I’m sure we’ve all heard the term “the gift of faith.” Well, this is what it means. It’s always God who freely initiates the relationship, to which we respond in faith. Faith is a human response but one made possible by the divine love and the divine will. God draws the response of faith from us—the response that brings us into ever-deeper communion with him. Faith transforms us, allowing us to live not for ourselves alone but for God and others.
In this sense, faith is a gift of love—one that includes God’s self-disclosure to us. As the Catechism tells us, the gift of faith is meant to guide us to “the ultimate meaning” of our lives. And what can the ultimate meaning of our lives be but God himself.
So faith is the definitive on-ramp. It illuminates the path home, but it does more than that. It becomes the path home.
A gift demands a response. We can accept it, reject it, or ignore it. What is the proper response to God’s gift of faith?
To answer that, let’s remember our Blessed Mother—the most perfect example of faith we have—at the Annunciation. Mary has no idea what lies ahead when she hears the angel’s confusing message. Yet she ponders that message and even asks a question about it, allowing God to work in her, perhaps allowing herself time to respond to God’s invitation in perfect faith. “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord, let it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38), she then says, accepting the will of God with her whole being, entrusting herself totally to another. And that’s what faith ultimately does for us. It allows us to act totally, to be truly “whole beings.”
There are a hundred ways of describing how faith transforms us, and it doesn’t matter which way we choose to express it. It only matters that we respond to God’s gift of faith and let that gift do its work in us. Let it permeate your life in such a way that you can learn to trust as Mary did, as God is calling each of us to do.
A Day of Favor from God
Living for the Lord Today
Do you remember the parable Jesus told about the rich fool? His land produced a bountiful harvest, so he began making plans to store his extra grain: he would tear down his old barns and build larger ones. He envisioned a future life of ease and relaxation. But for that man, tomorrow never came. He died that very night (Luke 12:16-21).
Jesus told that story to warn people against greed. But the parable also shows us what happens when we live only for tomorrow and not for today. We miss opportunities to love and care for people and to deepen our relationship with the Lord. It’s not that we shouldn’t plan and save for the future. It’s just that focusing on it too much can cause us to miss out on all that God wants for us today.
The man in the parable believed that once his grain was safely stored, he could “rest, eat, drink, [and] be merry” (Luke 12:19). The irony is that the man was projecting a future life full of happiness and joy when in fact God wanted him—and us—to live joyfully and peacefully today.
Why? First, simply because God loves us. He delights in us. We are the apple of his eye (Psalm 17:8). He is close to us, even when we are not aware of him. We are always in his heart: “Can a mother forget her infant, be without tenderness for the child of her womb? Even should she forget, I will never forget you” (Isaiah 49:15). Like a good parent, God wants us to know his love and live for him every day that he gives to us. Recalling his love and closeness can give us joy and peace today, no matter what is going on.
God Touches Us in the Present. There’s another reason to live each day joyfully. God has given us today as a gift. It is only in the present moment that we have the opportunity to experience his mercy and grace—and share it with the people around us. We can look back on our past and see how faithful God has been. We can trust that he will be with us in the future. But it is only now, in this very moment, that we can experience God’s touch on our hearts. It is only now, in this very moment, that we can receive his grace. Like the manna in the desert, we can’t store it up. Today’s grace is available to us now, and only now.
We might look at our daily lives as routine and predictable. But amid all our duties and responsibilities, we can be aware of God’s presence. In the eighteenth century, the French Jesuit priest Jean-Pierre de Caussade wrote a book entitled Abandonment to Divine Providence, which has become a spiritual classic. He says this about the present: “There is not a moment in which God does not present himself under the cover of some pain to be endured, of some consolation to be enjoyed, or of some duty to be performed. All that takes place within us, around us, or through us, contains and conceals his divine action.” So let’s not miss a single moment of God’s grace and presence!
If Today You Hear His Voice. Not only is God with us each and every moment of our day, but he also wants to speak to us and continue to form us into his image and likeness. That’s why daily prayer is so important. We don’t want to miss what God wants to say to us today. He may want to assure us of his mercy and forgiveness. He may want to give us clarity about a problem we are facing or inspire us to reach out and help someone close to us. He may want to quietly prepare us for something unexpected that only he knows will come later that day.
God speaks to us not only in our daily time of prayer but during the events of our day as well. In every moment, we can be alert to his voice. He may want to guide or inspire us to pray for someone, to offer a word of encouragement, or to change our plans. Remember: the Holy Spirit lives in us! As we become more attuned to his voice, we will live each day in God’s will and do whatever he asks of us in that moment.
Today also gives us the opportunity to be freed from our sins. We can hear the voice of the Spirit convicting us of our sins so that we can turn to the Lord and be forgiven. As St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:3). So we don’t want to let today go by without examining our hearts and asking the Lord for forgiveness for any ways, big or small, that we have sinned. Each day he gives us is another day to receive his mercy and grace.
Building God’s Kingdom Today. Today you have the chance to help build God’s kingdom on earth. You cannot live tomorrow right now, and yesterday is gone. But today is filled with so much promise and hope. Often it’s the little, seemingly insignificant decisions we make each day that determine whether that will happen. But even the smallest of actions can create a ripple effect of grace that touches many, many people.
For example, today you might ask God for the grace to resist a temptation to gossip or to grow envious. You might look for opportunities to share your faith, perhaps by asking a friend if they would like you to pray for them, or even with them for a moment. God wants us to be “making the most of the opportunity” (Colossians 4:5). He wants us to be a vehicle of his love and mercy today. The same opportunities may not be there tomorrow!
Today is also the time God has given you to serve people. Again, it doesn’t have to be big. When you shop for groceries and make dinner, when you help your children with homework, when you offer to assist a coworker or a neighbor, you are serving in ways that build God’s kingdom. It’s interesting that on the last night Jesus lived on earth, he washed his disciples’ feet (John 13:1-14). How blessed we will be if we serve our brothers and sisters with each day God gives to us!
Finally, every day offers us numerous opportunities for simple acts of kindness. These too build God’s kingdom. Maybe the beleaguered cashier needs a smile or affirming word. Maybe you can graciously let someone in front of you on the road or make that donation you’ve been putting off. Maybe you can listen attentively—instead of tuning them out—while someone talks about their day. “Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have,” Scripture tells us. And why? Because “God is pleased by sacrifices of that kind” (Hebrews 13:16).
The Gift of Today. Every day God gives us to live on this earth is a gift no matter what our age or state of health. Every day, including today, he invites us to decide: “Will you stay close to me today? Will you serve me and my people? Will you make the most of each opportunity that I am going to give you today?”
Each morning when we open our eyes, we can say yes to God. “This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice in it and be glad” (Psalm 118:24). We never know what each day will be like, but when the evening comes, we can thank the Lord for that day.
Some of our “todays” will be filled with joy; some will contain challenges. Most will have both. But each and every day, God wants to give us all that we need to love and serve him. So even on those hard days, trust him. Trust that he has the grace you need at the moment you need it—because he is with you, right here, right now. Today.
The Immaculate Conception of Mary
O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us!
Have you ever wondered why there are so many beautiful works of art portraying the early life of Mary?
Why do imaginative stories like those of the birth of Mary to Anne and Joachim, her dedication as a young girl in the Temple, and her betrothal to Joseph have such a strong appeal?
Neither the gospels nor the church offer any information about Mary’s parentage, birth, infancy, or adolescence. Nor do they attempt any historical reconstruction of Mary’s unique conception. In defining the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary in 1854, Pope Pius IX simply stated, "The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God ... preserved immune from all stain of original sin." Nonetheless, we love those magnificent paintings that depict Marian legends—for example, Giotto’s lovely Scenes from the Lives of Joachim and Anne and Mary and Duccio’s Maestà altarpiece with his skillful renderings from the life of the Virgin.
Why do these works have such an effect? Because God created us with a deep capacity for wonder and awe. He has also given us the ability to dream and imagine, and he wants us to use this ability to lift up our hearts to him. So even if some of these works may not be historically accurate, these stories, paintings, and sculptures can really inspire us and bring us closer to God.
There is another point here, however. As inspiring as these works of art are, God’s actual plan for Mary is even more amazing and inspiring—precisely because it is real!
Just think: God’s plan for each one of us is just as fantastic as his plan for Mary. We may not have had the grace of an immaculate conception, but that doesn’t mean that we are barred from the glory of heaven that Mary knows right now. And neither does it mean that we have to wait for our final salvation before we can begin enjoying the adventure God wants to give us. The truth is, he is calling us to a life of beauty and holiness—right here and right now—that will make even the most stunning of paintings seem pale and dull in comparison. Lift up your heart and mind to him today and ask him about it. Rejoice in God’s faithfulness and love, manifested in the Blessed Virgin Mary, and say “Yes!” to him, as she did. Pray, “Lord, your plans or me are wondrously and infinitely greater than anything I could ever imagine. Open the eyes of my heart so that I would begin to see and to respond to you as Mary did, ‘May it be done to me according to your word.’”
Ask God to lead them into total happiness.
We have learned a lot about happiness from our little grandson, Edward. One Christmas while he was opening his gifts, he became intrigued by the crinkly sound of the gift wrap that Therese was scooping up off the floor.
She noticed his curiosity and made even more noise. With a twinkle in her eye, she flung a handful of paper high up into the air and shouted, “Yippee!” Edward was totally enthralled. With another “Yippee!” and a “Yeah!” from Therese, Edward joined her in flinging paper with reckless abandon. Just as quickly, his mother, Ann, ran for her camera. And every Christmas or birthday after that has included a “Yippee” bag full of paper.
How much we desire to bring happiness to our loved ones! Think about how you stood before your Christmas tree in years past, your heart bursting with a love that spilled out on brightly wrapped gifts. Think about the many Christmases, birthdays, and anniversaries you spent searching for the perfect gift that would make your loved one truly happy. And yet you wanted to give your family even more than those gifts. That desire is a tiny reflection of God’s desire to lavish your children, and all of his children, with happiness beyond measure.
Now, here are two important questions about all these occasions. How often do you watch for the tiny God-given eruptions of spiritual delight underneath the human happiness?  How often do you acknowledge God as the ultimate source of a son or daughter’s deepest and most profound joy?
Source of All Happiness.
Ultimately, only God can offer total, eternal happiness. And only God can give us the grace to enjoy every small happiness along the way. So it is good to thank God for the joyful moments in your son’s and daughter’s lives. It is like complimenting a good painter or a fine musician. So begin your prayers by acknowledging how God has already blessed your children and is leading them toward himself.  Then examine the kind of happiness that you most want for your adult children and for yourself. Picture the unimaginable, eternal delight that God wants to give. Make eternal happiness in God’s presence your point of reference and your goal as you pray for your daughters and sons.
Steve provides us with an example of how God can intervene in the pursuit of happiness.  He and his wife valued friendship above many things, so one day God intervened in their friendships.
I decided to leave the Church because of a difficulty, and took my wife, Caroline, and our five children with me. But we did not know that our parishioner friends kept praying for our return. It took a visit with a dear Catholic friend, Judy, who was dying of terminal cancer, for us to hear the Holy Spirit prompting us to come home to all of our friends in the Church. As we were driving home after visiting Judy, Caroline innocently asked, “If we were in this situation, what would we do?” After a short pause we both answered in unison, “We would go back to the Catholic Church.” And so we returned to the parish we had left. Later, when Caroline shared this great news with Judy’s husband, he sobbed for joy because Judy had been quietly praying for our return throughout her illness.
Steve and Caroline had encountered God’s incredible love, as did St. Maximilian Kolbe, which he expressed in this prayer: “Who would dare to imagine that you, O infinite, eternal God, have loved me for centuries, or to be more precise, from before the beginning of centuries? In fact you have loved me ever since you have existed as God ... and precisely because you love me, O good God, you called me from nothingness to existence!”
Steps toward God’s Happiness. Pray to our incredible God for the total happiness of a daughter or son often. Consider using these steps.
Step One : Thank God for creating your son or daughter to enjoy his eternal happiness.
Step Two : Thank God for particular moments of happiness. Create a list of happy moments that you can refer to often. (For example, our son Charlie used to run and leap into John’s arms, laughing all the way across the room. Our daughter Ann was so happy when she took her first steps that she laughed and cried at the same time. When our daughter Rose was a toddler, she took great delight in chasing seagulls.) Remembering those moments creates confidence in God’s ability to help our grown children find true and lasting happiness.
Step Three : Ask Jesus to forgive you for times when you were an obstacle to God’s happiness and love for your children.
Step Four : Tell Jesus that you trust him to bless your adult children with joy. And your trust, in the midst of difficulties, will release you from narrow prayers for little bits of happiness. Here is an example: “Oh Jesus, you alone know what will make my daughter happy and whole. You alone have set her on the path to eternal happiness in your presence, so do whatever you think is best. I only ask that you send her your Holy Spirit, as I place her in your heart.”
Hold onto the vision that each son or daughter has been created to enter and to re-enter God’s eternal joy, even at times when happiness disappears in a flash of bad news. This is why Jesus lived, died, and rose from the dead. This is why Jesus has come into our midst with good news of great joy. He is our hope for happiness. Jesus gives us the inner strength to survive all obstacles to joy. Jesus is the greatest evidence of the Father’s particular love for each of us. He is the One who sends his Holy Spirit to offer our children unending joy. This is why the Scriptures and the Church invite us to rejoice in the Lord, especially in prayer.

Rejoice in the Lord Always
Cry out, “Abba, Father—You are home in our hearts!”
Without a doubt, an adult’s life carries many burdens.
To paraphrase one of the psalmists, “How can we sing the songs of the Lord when we don’t really feel like it?” (see Psalm 137:4). Yet God ever calls, even commands, us to praise and thank him for his love and faithfulness. God doesn’t want the burdens of life to crush our joy. Instead, he calls us to come to him when we are burdened and weary so that he can give us rest and refreshment (Matthew 11:28-30).
The Battle for Prayer.
St. Teresa of Ávila once observed how her prayer would often start out as hard work, like having to lower a pail into a well to draw up water. Still, as she persevered, she would experience a transformation, as if the well had become a spring of living water within her (John 4:14). What began as 90 percent her effort ended up as 90 percent the Spirit’s power. This can be our experience as well if we but ask, persevere, and receive!
In the psalms, we have firsthand examples of how people like us stepped out in faith and determined to praise and thank God. Like Teresa of Ávila, they too began prayer as 90 percent their effort and ended up experiencing prayer as 90 percent the Spirit’s power. Time and again in the psalms, we see that memory played a vital role in transforming their prayer into joyous praise and thanksgiving. In some cases, the psalmist recalled a desperate situation in which he called out to the Lord and was delivered (Psalm 116:1-2). At other times, we read of a psalmist who is still in the midst of trouble but again uses his memory of God’s eternal attributes to move him to faith and thanksgiving as he waits for God to come to his rescue (7:1-2, 10).
We too can treasure all that the Lord has done. It is good to keep a journal and jot down all the ways we have seen God work in our lives and throughout salvation history. Then, as we do the work of drawing upon these memories in our prayer, we will begin to experience a change in our disposition. Our hearts will be lifted up, and praise and thanksgiving will begin to flow freely from our hearts and from our lips. What started out as our work will become God’s work as we allow the Spirit of truth to move within us.
Imagination. The psalmists also used their imaginations to move their hearts to joyful praise. They pictured the Lord as being “girded with might” (Psalm 65:6), or “clothed with honor and majesty” (104:1). They called him their “Shepherd” (23:1), and the “King of glory” (24:7). They imagined him stooping toward them and rescuing them from a miry pit (40:2) and pictured all of creation joining with them in singing his praise (96:11-12). Concrete images such as these helped move them to joyful praise, even in trying circumstances, and kept them open to receive more revelation of his love and promises.
It is good for us to ask the Holy Spirit to enkindle our imaginations so that we too might have a taste of the glory of God. Again, this will start out as 90 percent our work, but as we persevere, we may discover the Spirit lifting our imagination up and filling it with images of God’s majesty, power, or compassion welling up from our innermost being.
Intellect. Finally, the psalmists engaged their intellects as they gave praise for creation and not only for the starry skies above them (Psalm 19:1-6), but also for the law of the Lord planted within them (19:7-10). As they meditated on God’s word, they gave thanks that it was like a “lamp” for their feet and a “light” for their paths (119:105). They relied on the promises of God as truths which set them free from despair and negative thinking (85:8-9; 91:14-16). They took negative thoughts captive and set their hearts free to affirm the goodness of the Lord and his unfailing love for them (73:15-28). They asked God questions and opened themselves to hear his words in their hearts (2:7-9; 110:1, 4).
Like the psalmists, we too can set our minds on the unshakable truths of the gospel. This will enable us to overcome the negative thoughts that so often invade our prayer and our everyday lives. We can learn to say things like, “I feel like God has forsaken me, but I believe the truth that he loves me and I will praise him. I know that he will bring good out of this situation” (Psalm 22). Or when we feel we don’t measure up, we can counter this with the truths of God’s mercy and his desire to fill us with the joy of salvation (51:6-7, 12).
The Work of the Spirit in Our Praise. Even our smallest efforts at prayer can take on infinite value when we offer them to the Lord and believe that he wants to touch our hearts. God loves it when we reach out to him. He loves to run and meet us just as the father of the prodigal son did. Surrendered to his will, we rest in his arms and receive a love we do not merit.
What starts out as our work and an act of our will can be transformed as we ask the Holy Spirit to lift up our hearts (Psalm 146:8). At the heart of this transformation is the presence of Christ in us, the hope of glory. Like St. Teresa of Ávila, as we pull the water up from the well, God’s grace will begin to well up from within and cause spontaneous prayers of praise and thanksgiving to come out of our hearts and our mouths.
As we open ourselves to God’s work in prayer, the Holy Spirit will provide us with an ever-deepening revelation of Christ at the center of our lives. This discovery of Christ in us can lead us to the understanding that ultimately it is Christ in us who is praising his heavenly Father and giving him thanks (Romans 1:8; Ephesians 5:20).
As we lift our hearts in prayer and thanksgiving, we recall God’s wonderful deeds of creation, salvation, and the birth of the Church on Pentecost: We pray for a new Pentecost to touch every heart in the whole world as we eagerly await your coming. Pour out your Spirit that we might be lifted up in praise and thanksgiving and cry out like children, “Abba, Father, make your home in our hearts!” By the power of the Holy Spirit, our praise can ascend with Christ and in Christ to bring praise and honor and glory to God our heavenly Father.
Most Catholics are very familiar with the Rosary, but many are surprised when they discover the level of depth that is possible while “telling the beads.” An essential component of the Rosary is the association of one of the mysteries of Christ’s life with each decade.
The importance of these mysteries was well expressed by Pope St. Paul VI, who called them the “soul” of the Rosary "Marialis Cultus" (về việc tôn kính Ðức Maria trong Giáo Hội), 47) because it is precisely in these meditations that we come to know the various aspects of Jesus Christ’s work to save the world from sin and separation from God.
The first set of five mysteries is called Joyful and meditates on Jesus’ birth, infancy, and childhood, especially as recorded in St. Luke’s Gospel. The Luminous Mysteries consider key events from Christ’s public ministry. The Sorrowful Mysteries consider his suffering and death, and the Glorious Mysteries consider his resurrection and its aftermath.
The Mysteries from Mary’s Perspective.
There are a number of reasons to meditate on these mysteries while praying the ten Hail Marys of each decade. First, we learn to approach each mystery from the perspective of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Recall that Our Lady was present at many of these events, not only in the events surrounding Jesus’ birth, but also at the wedding feast of Cana and while Jesus carried his cross and was crucified. She was with the apostles in the upper room at Pentecost, so we can also safely assume that she saw the risen Lord Jesus and perhaps his ascension. Of course, she experienced her own assumption and crowning in heaven.
By repeating the Hail Mary, we address Our Lady with those greetings of St. Gabriel and St. Elizabeth, and then we ask for her prayers as we consider the mysteries. In this process, it is as if we were trying to look at each mystery of salvation from her maternal perspective, seeking to love Jesus Christ, the center of each mystery, as she does. I assume that the Virgin Mary had a more personal and a more highly motivated love of Jesus than we sinners do! As much as we may love Christ, the Virgin Mary can always lead us to a deeper love and a more uplifting perspective of faith in him.
Another reason to keep returning to these mysteries is to integrate the cycle of all twenty mysteries into the rhythm of our lives. 
At times the temptation may be to focus on the mysteries we like—perhaps the warmth of the nativity or the glory of the resurrection or the power of Pentecost. 
While it is permissible to feel drawn to emphasize a certain aspect of the mystery of salvation, as do many of the religious orders—the Passionists or the Resurrectionists, for example—the Christian faith encompasses all aspects of salvation. Praying through the cycle of the twenty mysteries will remind us to balance our meditation on all the key mysteries of salvation.
A variety of aids to meditating on the mysteries are available, including books or pamphlets called “Scriptural Rosaries,” which provide one verse of Scripture for each Hail Mary in every decade, or those with short reflections on each mystery. A person might do well to look up the mysteries in the Bible and read a small part of that passage, either at the beginning of each decade or in small sections between each Hail Mary. Other people simply focus on their own imaginative sense of each mystery, while still others concentrate on the words of the Hail Mary, the Our Father, or the Glory Be.
Everyone is free to approach the Rosary according to one’s own preference. However, the more open in heart and mind we are to the prayers and the mysteries, the greater will be the depth of prayer we experience.
Biblical scholar Fr. Mitch Pacwa is a popular speaker, writer, and TV host. This is adapted from his book How to Listen When God Is Speaking
Be at peace; your life is in God’s hands.
Genesis tells us that God made men and women in his image and likeness.
Just as important, God created us not to be slaves but for friendship. So God created us out of love, and he made us with a purpose and with a point, a goal in mind, a destiny. We come to understand our destiny through what Jesus has revealed to us: to partake in God’s own divine life forever. The goal of life, if you will, is expressed in 2 Peter 1:4: God made us to partake of the divine nature.
We were made to be divinized. You were made to be divinized. Not to dissolve into the blood that is God, but to partake of God’s own life. That’s the end for which we were made. That is the Christian worldview in which God has revealed himself to us—and we wouldn’t know this unless God had revealed it. There is one God, not many, and he is good. In fact, he is very good. And everything he made, he has made out of love. We human beings are the pinnacle of his creation because we are made in his image and likeness. Furthermore, he didn’t make us to be slaves; he made us for friendship: friendship with him and friendship with one another. And now everything we do fits into a purposeful life, and that changes everything.
“Fear Not, I Have Redeemed You”
So God says to us, “Fear not.” Why? “Because I have redeemed you,” meaning, “I have paid a price for you.” That’s what it means to be redeemed. When we think of the word “redeem,” we often think of coupons. But of course, Scripture uses this word over and over again. What the Lord is saying to us in the Old Testament, which is fulfilled in the person of Jesus, is that you and I have been bought—paid for—by him. “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name” (Isaiah 43:1).
So if you are dealing with fear and anxiety, let this soak in, because this is what God is saying to us: “You are mine.” Don’t misunderstand—we are not his possession that he can do whatever he wants with; instead, he is speaking as a bride to her bridegroom or a bridegroom to his bride. God says to each one of us, “I love you more than you could possibly imagine. And I’ve created everything. Everything I’ve done, I’ve done for you. The world I made, I made for you. I made you with a purpose in mind. Don’t panic. Understand that when I said I redeemed you, I said it not just with words but with actions—the pouring out of my blood. It was for you because you were worth the trouble.” If you know that truth, then all of a sudden the fear begins to dissipate.
Listen to what the Lord says earlier in Isaiah. Remember, he is not just speaking twenty-five hundred years ago but right now to you: “Say to the fearful of heart: Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God, ... he comes to save you” (Isaiah 35:4, NABRE). That’s how much you mean to him; that’s how much we mean to him. God himself is coming. He’s not just going to send an angel. He’s not just going to send a prophet. He comes to save us.
If you are feeling anxious and fearful as you read this, that knot in the back of your neck should be beginning to relax and your shoulders, beginning to drop. This is what Scripture is supposed to do; it is supposed to heal us. As we read God’s word, this is what we can be thinking: “I’m not alone. I don’t have to look out for number one. I have a Father. He loves me. He is good and powerful, and he’s always thinking about me; I’m always on his mind. He comes to save me.”
Again in Isaiah, the Lord says, “Fear not, for I am with you” (41:10). That’s meant for us, right now. No matter what’s currently going on in your life—financial concerns, health concerns, concerns about your kids, wondering how in the world you are going to get through whatever transition is in front of you—this is what the Lord says: “Fear not, I am with you. I am with you.” This God is with you, the Master of the universe, the One who never gets nervous, the One who has no rivals.
And continuing on with that verse from Isaiah (41:10), God says, “Be not dismayed, for I am your God” (emphasis added). And because he is our God and we belong to him (“You are mine”), then together we can handle whatever is going on in our lives right now.
Why Should I Be Afraid?
And so, as we come to hear the Lord speak to us and to know these truths, we can say to him certain things, also from Scripture. Although Psalm 23 is so well known to us, there’s a stark admission in it: “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death” (verse 4). Maybe you’re immersed in grief right now. Maybe you’ve lost a spouse, a child, a parent, or a sibling in the last few months. You’re in the valley of death, and it’s not romantic. But though you’re there, what does the psalmist say? “I fear no evil.” Not because I’m not in the valley of the shadow of death, but because you, Lord, are with me. And I know that. And I know who you are. And I know what you’ve done for me. And I know that you care.
Psalm 27 says something similar: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (verse 1). If God is never afraid, never nervous, never scared of anything, and he’s on my side, then why should I be afraid? He is with me always, all the time. I just need to learn to turn to him, and I don’t always do that.
In the New Testament, the Lord’s words take on a different kind of force because of the person of Jesus and the reality of the Incarnation. Remember the passage in Luke in which the angels appear to the shepherds after the birth of Jesus?
And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. (2:8-9)
This is the response to an angel. Angels aren’t little cute cherubs! When angels show up in Scripture, they terrify people. The shepherds were filled with fear.
And the angel said to them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you [us] good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you [to us] is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10-11, emphasis added)
That’s why he has come—he has come to save. In the Old Testament, God said he would come to save us. But it was unthinkable for the Jewish people to try to comprehend that God would actually come to do it in the flesh. But that’s what he’s done. He didn’t send an angel. He didn’t commission another Moses. He came, and he came to save us.
What are you anxious about? A job? Getting into the college? Or “Is this medical test going to turn out well?” Jesus says the Gentiles seek these things, but they don’t know they have a God, let alone a Father who is good and loving, who made us not to be slaves but to be friends.
True Peace Is from Jesus
Here is a passage we hear at Mass when we come together: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid” (John 14:27). The world gives peace by eliminating conflict. That’s the only way the world knows peace. That will never happen in our lives, if for no other reason than that the deepest conflict is the one in our hearts. And that conflict will be raging until the Lord finally finishes purifying us and we are ushered into heaven.
But Jesus gives peace in the midst of conflict. When you come back from the doctor with a diagnosis that you didn’t want to hear, all of a sudden, there’s panic. Yet in reality, nothing has changed. You were in God’s hands before, when everything was going well (or so you thought), and you’re in God’s hands now. The God who was with you when you thought you were doing just fine and when you really didn’t need him all that much is the same God who is still with you. You belong to God. No matter what it is that is taking place in your life, you can be at peace—because your life is in his hands. And because he is never afraid, and he can handle any situation that you could ever face
Growing in Gratitude
Six Simple Ways to Give Thanks
Have you ever been so filled with gratitude that you felt you could burst? Most of us have had that experience at one time or another. Maybe you felt that way on the day you were married or on the day your child or grandchild was born. Maybe it happened as you watched a beautiful sunrise. On such days, it’s easy to thank and praise God.
But sometimes it can be downright challenging to be grateful, especially when everything seems to go haywire and we feel like we are losing control. We might be unemployed or in a difficult relationship. Maybe we are confined to a hospital room or a prison cell. Or perhaps a friend or loved one has died. Many times, we’re just plain exhausted from dealing with the day-to-day stresses of life. How can we learn to be grateful for our blessings even in those situations?
Growing in gratitude is a lifelong process of learning to live in a God-centered way. We begin to recognize and acknowledge that God is close to us and is at work in our lives. We are also able to see how he is blessing us even in those trials that are part of human life. In this article, we want to offer six strategies that may help you to become more grateful—both to God and to the people around you.
Begin your prayer each day with praise and thanksgiving. It’s natural to want to ask God to solve our problems when we come to him in prayer. But how much better it would be to begin your prayer time with praise and thanksgiving. For example, you could say, “Thank you, Lord, for loving me. Thank you for coming in the flesh to save me. Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins. Thank you even for the trials I’m going through, because I know you will work them out for my good and help me to grow through them.”
It’s not that God needs your thanks or praise, but he knows how good it is for you to spend the first several minutes focusing on him and giving him the honor that he is due. Recalling his love, constancy, and never-ending care puts everything into perspective. No matter what you might be dealing with, God is good and has a good plan for your life.
Pray the psalms regularly. Jesus himself sang and prayed the psalms. And just as they did for Jesus, the psalms provide us with the words to express a wide variety of emotions to our Father, from sorrow for sin to crying out for help and assistance.
But some psalms are especially helpful for recalling God’s goodness and mercy. For example, Psalm 138 begins, “I thank you, Lord, with all my heart; in the presence of the angels to you I sing... . I praise your name for your mercy and faithfulness” (138:1, 2).
You can use the psalms to praise and thank God, especially when you don’t have the words to praise him on your own. Some of these include Psalms 34, 92, 100, 103, 107, 111, 118, and 136. But nearly every psalm has a line or two expressing thanks to God or praising him for who he is. Take note of these verses; perhaps even commit a few to memory so that you can thank and praise God all day long.
Spend a few minutes each evening thanking God for your blessings that day. St. Ignatius of Loyola believed that ingratitude was the root of all other sins. So he had his fellow Jesuits do a spiritual exercise each evening before retiring. They not only examined their consciences and repented of any sins from the day, but they also thanked God for the ways in which he was present to them and acted in their lives. Many people do this exercise, called the Daily Examen, each evening. It is a profound way to grow in gratitude as well as a way to recognize how involved God is in our lives.
So set aside a few minutes during the evening or before you go to sleep to think of what happened that day. Try to remember hour by hour what you were doing. If you had your prayer time that morning, now as the day comes to a close, perhaps you can thank God for some insight. Maybe you had a warm conversation with a coworker or a family member. Maybe you remembered to call a friend in need. You could even thank God for simple blessings like a warm home on a cold day or a tasty meal at dinner.
By faithfully practicing this exercise, you will be able to see more and more of your blessings, and your heart will be filled with joy as you recall how faithful and loving your God is.
Look for God’s blessings, especially amid the difficulties of life. As we said above, it’s much more challenging to give thanks to God when we are going through tough times. But that’s when it’s especially crucial to recall how God is taking care of us and our loved ones. It’s in those times that we may feel as if God has abandoned us. But when we look with the eyes of faith, we’ll find that God is very close to us. He never forgets us. He is faithful to his promise to love us and guide us.
Jane’s husband, Joe, was dying of cancer. It was the most difficult time in her life. But even on the hard days, Jane recognized that God was present. She saw him in the priest who came to give Joe Communion and the Anointing of the Sick. She saw him in the caregivers who came each day to help her care for Joe’s needs. She saw it in the friends and family who came to bring a meal or to pray with Joe. Even as she grieved at the prospect of losing her husband, Jane was able to thank the Lord for his kindness to her and her husband. And her gratitude to the Lord gave Jane hope in the midst of the most challenging trial of her life.
Express your gratitude to other people. Have you ever noticed how pleasant it is to be around people who are grateful? They exude a certain joy because rather than complaining or criticizing, they notice and thank people for what they are doing.
We all like to feel appreciated. So make it a point to thank the people you interact with each day. Thank the clerk at the grocery store or the receptionist at the doctor’s office. Thank your coworker for a job well done. Thank your pastor for serving you and your fellow parishioners. So many people are serving us each day, showing their love for us in small and big ways. By thanking them, we acknowledge their efforts, which goes a long way toward building warm and close relationships.
But don’t stop there. Thank your family members, those people you most often take for granted. You might even want to write each of them a short note and tell them all the ways in which you are grateful for them. What a gift that would be to your loved one! Keep a copy for yourself as well to remind you of all that you have to be thankful for because that person is part of your life.
Thank God ahead of time. What if you were to thank God for his blessings even before you received them? That was the advice of Blessed Solanus Casey (1870–1957), a Capuchin friar from Detroit who had a gift for healing. One day the parents of a sixteen-month-old daughter with leukemia came to his monastery. After praying with her, Fr. Casey told her parents to “thank God ahead of time.” The little girl was miraculously healed, but Fr. Casey wanted them to thank God for whatever might happen.
By thanking God for what we are asking of him before we even receive it, we are saying, “Lord, I trust that you are working in this situation. Whatever happens, I will give you thanks because of your mercy and goodness.” That can be difficult, but such a prayer is a faith-filled affirmation that God is at work even when we can’t see it.
Gratitude in Heaven. Think about what it will be like in heaven as we look back on our lives. We will want to thank all the people who helped us to get there, those who taught us about the Lord’s love and who led us on the path of discipleship. We will be thankful for all the joys we experienced and even the difficulties, all of which God used to help us grow in holiness. We will overflow with gratitude to the Father, who created us to live with him forever; to Jesus, who died for us and rose from the dead to save us; and to the Holy Spirit, who lived in us and helped us in countless ways to follow Jesus.
This is the gratitude the Lord wants us to experience even today. May our hearts always overflow with praise and thanksgiving to the God who loves us—always and forever.
Listen to His Voice
“My sheep hear my voice” (John 10:27).
Like many of you, I’ve known God since I was a child. I’ve prayed for as long as I can remember.
But please don’t take that to mean that I have always walked faithfully as a Christian. Like so many people, I very deliberately put off making the decision to follow Jesus because I was deathly afraid of what would happen to me if I did that. Does that sound familiar?
There was a voice in my head—and I think that same voice is in the heads of many people. It said over and over again, “Do not enter! If you enter and surrender to Jesus, you will lose your identity and all the things you love.” It said, “Do not enter! If you do, you’ll lose control of your life.” It said, “Do not enter! The Christian life is less, not more. If you give yourself to Jesus, you’ll probably never have any fun again.” It said, “Do not enter! If you do, you’ll become some sort of Jesus freak.” It said, “Do not enter! If you do, God’s going to make you do things you don’t want to do—things that you hate. It’s just going to be too hard.”
And then the voice took another approach—a far more devastating one. It said, “Do not enter! You’re not good enough—not with all the things you’ve done in your life.” It said, “Do not enter! The Church is a place for super Catholics, the spiritual elite, the ones who have it all together. Who do you think you are, comparing yourself to them?”
Let’s deal with the last objection first. And we’ll do that by telling a universal truth.
No “Spiritual Elite”
The Church does not exist for a spiritual elite, because there is no spiritual elite. We’re all human, all affected by original sin, and all our lives are disordered in one way or another. No priest has it together, and neither does any member of a religious community.
I’ve been a priest for more than twenty years now, and I’ve heard thousands of confessions. I can assure you that we are all sinners. We’re all works in progress. We’re all struggling with something.
Your parish is not a meeting place for the perfected. It’s a place for anyone who wants to encounter Jesus. It’s for those who are hungry for more. It’s for those who want more than what the world can offer, those looking for real depth in their lives. It’s for those who suspect that Jesus was telling the truth when he said, “I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly” (John 10:10).
I don’t know about you, but I want more. If there’s abundant life to be had, then I want it! I’ve tried almost everything the world can offer, and it’s not enough. I have a bigger appetite than this world can satisfy. There’s a hole inside me that can’t be filled by anything but God, and that aches when it’s empty.
Let’s look at the life of St. Augustine, who lived hundreds of years ago. He was hungry for truth; he was hungry for goodness; he was hungry for beauty. And that’s not all he was hungry for. Augustine’s physical appetites were substantial, and he lived a very disordered life because of them. He yearned to become a Christian, but one massive obstacle stood in his path: chastity seemed impossible for him.
Then one day Augustine experienced a vision of a host of saints, young and old, male and female. And all of them had made the decision to turn around, reroute their lives, and surrender to God. All of them had embraced the chastity that Augustine thought he could not.
“Can you not do what these men have done, what these women have done?” the voice of a beautiful woman he called “Continence” seemed to be saying to him. It was as if the holy men and women in his vision were cheering him on, praying for him.
Shortly afterward Augustine heard a child’s voice urging him to pick up the Bible and read. He picked it up, and these were the words to which he opened: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh” (Romans 13:14).
At that moment, Augustine surrendered his life to Jesus (Confessions, book 8, chapters 11 and 12). He took his first step on the path that would lead him to become not only one of the greatest theologians in the history of the Church but one of the most significant figures in human history.
A Call to Surrender
This last story is far more personal. It happened at my mother’s kitchen table. The two of us were talking, drifting from one topic to another. The conversation eventually turned to my father and my brother, both of whom we had lost in the previous year.
As we spoke, my eyes were drawn to a photograph on the table, one that I had never seen before. There were my dad and my brother, sitting in Comerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers. I never even knew that the two of them had gone to a game together without anyone else from the family. But there they were, in the order in which they had left us. And they were staring out from the picture. It was as if they were looking directly at me. And for a moment, as I held that photo, it felt as if they were speaking to me, saying something like, “Come on, John! You can do this! Take the final steps; surrender yourself to Jesus. Come on, John! Just give it all to Jesus.”
What do I conclude from that? Two things. The first is that God is constantly speaking to us—speaking to us through the most ordinary things of our lives—and that what he says to us is of vital importance.
The second thing is that I have—you have—family and friends in heaven right now. And they aren’t simply watching us. They’re cheering for us, rooting us on as we make our journey through life. They’re praying for us, doing everything they can for us, so that we can run the race, fight the fight. They are loving us with a love that we can barely comprehend, so that one day we will join them in a place that is beyond all description, a place where we finally experience the fulfillment of all desire.
There is nothing more important than giving everything to God, and we are indeed surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses who will help us do that. So don’t be afraid. Don’t pay any attention to those voices that tell you, “Do not enter.” Don’t even glance in their direction. Pay attention instead to the voice—that quiet but incessant voice—that calls to you from every corner of your life.
“My sheep hear my voice,” Jesus tells us. And we will hear his voice if we try to. He speaks to us constantly, and what he is says is “Enter.” He stands on the other side of the door that is our mind and our heart. He is waiting for us to fall into his embrace the moment we throw that door open.
So do what the one who loves you more than anyone else wants you to do. Listen to his voice. Open that door that you’ve kept so tightly closed, and enter. Simply enter.
You can count on Jesus to do the rest.
This silent servant of the Lord has much to teach us.
Here is a riddle for you: he is the most influential person in the Bible, yet not a single word of his is recorded. Can you guess who this is?
If you answered Joseph, the husband of Mary, you’re right! Of course, we honor Joseph on his feast day of March 19. And many schools, churches, and hospitals are named after him. But by and large, Mary gets most of our attention, but Joseph played a crucial role in the Gospels, and we can learn a lot from him. We can see in him someone who is obedient, humble, and generous. We see a man willing to make major sacrifices for his family and for the Lord. We see someone humble but courageous, a man God could rely on. So let’s take a look at this silent servant of the Lord to see what he can teach us.
The Right Man for the Job. Most employers know how important it is to find just the right person to fill a key position in a company. They look for people with the best qualifications, a good work ethic, and an ability to work well with the other employees. So what do you think would be a good job description for the role of “foster father” to the Son of God? What kind of person was God looking for?
If we look at the criteria God used with other people in the past, we might get a good idea of who could become the “earthly father” of his Son. In the past, God chose people like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David. We look to these men as great heroes of the faith, yet each of them had their flaws. Abraham lied about his wife, Sarah, and let the king of Egypt take her into his harem (Genesis 12:10-20). Jacob was a master manipulator (31:1-21). Moses killed a man and then fled the country to avoid prosecution (Exodus 2:11-15). David committed adultery and murder (2 Samuel 11:1-27).
If they were so flawed, why did God choose them? Because despite their flaws, they tried their best to live by faith. They loved God and sought to live in obedience to him. It wasn’t their talents and gifts that won God over; it was their open, trusting hearts. The Bible calls Abraham “the friend of God” (James 2:23). It tells us that God spoke to Moses “face to face, as a person speaks to a friend” (Exodus 33:11). And it tells us that David was “a man after God’s own heart” (1 Samuel 13:14).
In other words, God knew what kind of men these were. He knew that despite their weaknesses, they would stay with him and try to be faithful. And this is exactly how God saw Joseph. He knew that Joseph was “a righteous man” whose heart would always be in the right place (Matthew 1:19). And so he chose him for this noble but demanding task.
A Man of Faith. God chose Joseph to protect, care for, and lead the Holy Family because he was a man of faith. When Mary told him that she was pregnant, Joseph was deeply hurt, but instead of exposing her, he decided to divorce her quietly. Imagine that! As hurt or confused or angry as he might have been, he still knew he should try to shield her from gossip and cruelty.
But when an angel confirmed what Mary had told him—that she was, in fact, pregnant by the Holy Spirit—Joseph changed his mind. He stepped out in faith and embraced the new role God had for him. He had no idea how the future was going to play out, but it didn’t matter. God had made his will known, and Joseph accepted it.
After Jesus was born, the angel warned Joseph that his family was in danger and that he had to flee Israel. Again, Joseph gave up his whole world—his plans, his friends, his home, and his work—and moved the family to Egypt on a moment’s notice. He didn’t have a job there, he probably didn’t know anyone there, and he likely didn’t have much money. Still, Joseph obeyed.
We can say that Joseph’s faith had already been emboldened by everything that had happened: Mary’s surprise pregnancy, the angel’s message, Jesus’ birth, and the visit of the Magi. But we all know how easy it can be to lose sight of past blessings when present troubles crop up. Joseph may or may not have been afraid, but he didn’t let fear control him. Instead, he trusted that God would take care of him and his family. He never allowed himself to look back and regret his decision because he never forgot who was behind all of these events.
Embracing a New Plan. God has a marvelous plan for each of our lives. Sometimes that plan is very different from what we have in mind. You can imagine Joseph, before the angel’s visit, planning on a quiet, happy life in the town of Nazareth. But that didn’t happen! Surely Joseph never thought he would have to uproot his young family and flee to Egypt. He never imagined that he would have to guard the innocent baby entrusted to him—and against someone as cruel and powerful as King Herod!
Joseph never had any training on how to raise the Son of God, either. Imagine how many times he doubted himself and wondered if he was up to the task? Imagine how many times he prayed, “God, please help me; I don’t want to make any mistakes.” Imagine Joseph, after seeing Jesus teaching the elders in the Temple, asking himself, “How can I teach my son, when he ought to be teaching me?” Joseph must have faced all kinds of doubts and fears. But he kept moving forward. And look at what he was able to accomplish!
Formed by Grace. God is asking us the same questions he asked Joseph: “Are you willing to build up your family for the sake of my Church? You don’t have to be perfect. But you do have to learn how I have called you to live.”
God has blessed us with gifts and talents, just as he blessed Joseph. And just as he did for Joseph, he asks us to use those talents as we step out in faith and lead our families to him. As the Catechism of the Catholic Church tells us, parents are the “first heralds” of the faith for their children, and the home is “the domestic church, a community of grace and prayer” (2225, 1666).
Joseph didn’t have a blueprint or a handbook on how to protect Mary, care for the Holy Family, or raise the Son of God. All he had were his own good intentions, his willingness to learn through trial and error, and his trust in God’s grace and guidance. But that was all he needed. The same is true for us.
St. Ignatius of Loyola once wrote, “There are very few men [or women] who realize what God would make of them if they abandoned themselves entirely into his hands and let themselves be formed by his grace.” That’s what Joseph did, and that’s what God wants us to do.
Keep Moving Forward. So take Joseph as your model, and try your best to devote yourself to serving God and your family. Take one or two small areas that you want to work on and focus on them. Don’t try to do everything; just take it one step at a time, and you’ll find God opening more and more doors for you.
Then, when you come up against your weaknesses or when you find yourself falling into sin, remember Abraham, Moses, and David. Remember that you’re only human, just as they were. God doesn’t expect you to be perfect, just as he didn’t expect Joseph to perfect. All he asks is that you be as faithful as you can and keep moving forward.
Make this your prayer: “Father, I give you permission to form me and shape me. Let your grace take hold of my life so that I can become more like your servant Joseph.” He’ll take care of everything else—just as he did for every other hero of the faith.
Jesus gives us his grace, healing, and power so we can love as he does.
Jesus wants us to have right and loving relationships, especially within our families. He wants us to forgive everyone who has hurt us—seventy times seven times, if necessary.
He asks us not to condemn, not to hold any anger against anyone, but to replace resentment with love. In short, Jesus calls us to love others as fully as he has loved us (John 15:12).
If we were to compare these demands with our experience, we might come to the conclusion that it’s nearly impossible to fulfill them. Our human frailty convinces us that we simply cannot live out such a high calling on our own strength. Some wounded relationships and scarred memories will take a very long time to be healed. That’s why we need to turn to Jesus and ask him to give us his grace, his healing, and his transforming power. During this season of Lent, experiment with this method. Ask God to help you forgive. Give the Spirit a chance to heal your wounds.
This prayer really works. For example, one person was deeply hurt over a division between himself and some close friends in his neighborhood. He wanted to let go of his bitterness, but the pain was too great. He even developed physical pain in his arms and shoulders because of the tension in his heart. When he asked some friends to pray with him for inner healing, he was set free from his bitterness and from his physical pain! We can be tempted to dismiss a story like this as a unique work of God that is beyond what we can normally expect. But God wants us to know that he is prepared to work this powerfully in all of our lives.
Jesus wants to heal the wounded relationships of our past—especially those within our marriages and families. He wants to cover all of our resentments, hurts, and guilt with his precious blood. He wants us all to move forward, with the wind of the Spirit at our backs, in the call to become more like him and to share his forgiveness and mercy with the world.
As long as sin is in the world, we will continue to be hurt by others and even to hurt other people ourselves. The memories of hurtful situations and relationships will remain with us, but Jesus wants to heal them so that they no longer cause us crippling pain. The more we are set free from bondage to our past, the more we will be transformed into Christ, and the more we will be able to have mercy on those how have hurt us.
Invite the Lord into your memories and ask him to heal you. Allow him to set you free from captivity to old memories and move you into the healing and transforming presence of God.
Where was God when Notre Dame was in flames?
Yesterday’s heartbreaking fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris seemed to bring the world together in stunned grief. And coming at the beginning of Holy Week, when Christians worldwide mark the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the symbolism was almost too much to bear. I confess that I wept when I watched this ancient church be consumed by fire.
As the smoke poured from the medieval stone cathedral, flames leapt from the wooden roof and, in perhaps the most terrible moment, the ornate metal spire collapsed like a cinder, it was hard for many of us not to think of the suffering and death of Jesus. During his public crucifixion, just as yesterday, crowds of people looked on in horror—feeling powerless, overcome with grief and wondering what they could possibly do.
Among those people was Jesus’ mother, Our Lady: Notre Dame. Our Lady knows exactly what it is like to stand by and see someone you love suffer and die.
The answer is: everywhere. God was there among the crowds kneeling, praying and singing the “Ave Maria” and the “Lourdes Hymn.” With each of those prayers and hymns, they were calling on Our Lady’s help, in front of her building. This was an expression of their deep faith, and so God was there.
God was there among the firefighters who selflessly rushed into a burning building that represents the spiritual heart of France. There is a parable right there. How much does God love us? As much as a firefighter who runs into a building on fire to save it.
And God was with the fire chaplain who risked his own life to save one of the most precious relics in the cathedral, what is believed to be the Crown of Thorns. It was a vivid reminder that the story of that building, the story of Our Lady, is intimately bound up with the passion and death of Our Lord.
Late last night, after the fire had been extinguished, we were left with a dramatic image: the cross, high above the altar, gleaming in the smoldering interior of the cathedral, a powerful symbol of Christian hope.
Hope is the final message. And no one knows this better than Notre Dame. She knows that suffering is not the last word.
Because the story of Holy Week is not simply one of death and destruction. It is, more important, one of hope and of new life. Good Friday makes no sense without Easter Sunday. Our Lady knows that hope is stronger than despair, love is stronger than hatred and life is stronger than death. And that nothing is impossible with God. Christians are a people who know sadness and yet who live in hope.
As you look on these images and as Notre Dame rebuilds in the coming days, months and years, let us ask for the prayers of Our Lady, Notre Dame, the one who understood what it meant to witness suffering but who also understands what it means to hope in the promise of new life.
My time on active duty showed me who is in control.
They say that war and deployments change you, and that you’re never the same afterwards. As a fifty-three-year-old Navy Captain who has been deployed to war in the Middle East several times, I can vouch that this is true. But it doesn’t mean that all the change is bad: you just see things differently when you return home. For me, one of the greatest changes is the way I look at prayer.
Each time I was deployed, the experience was much the same. Epic sand storms and incredible heat, with temperatures of 130° F or more, and humidity that could reach over 90 percent. Drinking one water bottle after another, with endless trips to the portable toilets. Cramped living conditions, zero privacy, and lines for everything. Deployment to a war zone also means combat conditions, danger, fear, self-doubt, and prolonged separation from family and friends.
In these difficult circumstances, with so many things out of your hands, you see how little control you have over your life and the lives of those entrusted to your care. But very intensely, you realize that God is always in control and that he hears you when you turn to him. This sense of God’s closeness became a living reality for me, as I brought him my concerns for my family and the troops under my command.
Weekly Mass was the highlight of my prayer life during deployment. For Catholic troops, it’s not just an obligation—it’s a sanctuary and a place of peace.
Mass was a simple affair. The chaplain would arrive with a small box containing missals, a chalice, wine, hosts, and everything else he needed. There might be anywhere from five to fifty people; the first two to arrive did the readings, and we all sang what we could manage. The priest would put on his vestments and we’d start—sometimes right out in the open desert with a utility table for an altar. The biggest Marines you’ve ever seen would come from out of nowhere to stand, humble and needy, in that small circle. Even if you could hear the sounds of battle around you and were worried about being shot at, you wanted to be there for those twenty minutes of peace.
After Mass, if the chaplain had time, he heard confessions. We would line up and confess our sins face-to-face when our turn came up, with those behind standing a respectful distance back. Then the chaplain would be off to the next FOB (forward operating base). I always prayed for these priests. They were often overworked, due to the shortage of Catholic chaplains, but they never complained.
We appreciated their sacrifice, because weekly Mass meant everything. In those few minutes, Christ restored us and made us strong enough to handle the next week. We would close our eyes and remember our loved ones back home, knowing that they were hearing the same Scripture readings that day. Through the Mass and our faith in Christ, we were connected.
Early every morning before my day got going fast, I would read my daily Scripture. The Word Among Us was a great help—I discovered it while deployed, among the donated materials that the chaplains set out. Then I would pray for my family and for the men and women who were serving with me. I’d pray for those who had died that week and for their families. When our missions were especially dangerous—convoys through areas where there were snipers and IEDs, for example—I prayed for that, too.
During the day, I looked for opportunities to keep turning to God. Even with little time and no privacy, I could usually find a few minutes to pull out my Bible, read a passage, and intercede. And just to help me remember everyone and everything I was praying for, I kept a prayer list of Post-it notes in my Bible. In the fog of war, you get so tired that you can’t always remember names and needs without some help. Those sticky notes were invaluable!
Deployed service men and women have all the same concerns and problems that we had at home. And deployment can make them worse. We worry about our spouses, with all the extra work and burden they are carrying alone. We wonder if our children are doing well in school. I remember hearing a sailor on the phone with his wife one night, talking her through the bills: “Honey, take four envelopes and write out ‘mortgage,’ ‘groceries,’ ‘gas’ … .” He did his best to sound positive, but his chin quivered as he spoke, and I knew his military pay wasn’t enough. His name went on my prayer list, too.
Letters and e-mails from home let me know that other people had me on their prayer list. My parents had a prayer circle of other elderly parishioners who prayed for my service members and me. This was huge! Some of these people I had never even met. Knowing that they were remembering us and lifting us up to the Lord gave me a sense of security and hope that we would make it through.
In “the world,”as troops refer to home when they’re deployed, it’s easy to think you’re in control. You go where you want; eat what you want, when you want; watch what you want, with remote controls in your hands. When you’re deployed, you don’t have choices like that because you’re not in control.
And so I prayed. That was all I could do—and it was the best thing I could ever do. I learned that the Lord was very near. Sometimes, a sailor would come and tell me about bad things happening with his family back home, and I’d see this big, powerful guy break down in tears. I would address the problem by contacting our command back home. But it was prayer that brought peace to that service member in front of me. As we prayed, I often felt like the words I was speaking were coming from somewhere else.
So yes, my deployments have changed me. There’s not a single Sunday that I don’t relive a Mass in Iraq or somewhere else in the Middle East. When I lector, there’s not a single time that I don’t think back to reading Scripture at Mass in a war zone, where church means “us”—the people and not a building, just like in the early church. As I read the Old Testament, I see a place I’ve seen before, not an image from a movie. I feel the sand and hot wind on my face, and for a moment, I’m back there.
Best of all, I now know without a doubt that God is with me and that he hears me whenever—and wherever—I pray.
We have this hope and confidence: Jesus is with us always, and that in him, the Church is able to withstand even the gates of the netherworld.
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a huge increase in productivity in the developed world. With the advent of assembly-line manufacturing, factories and mills made large strides in efficiency and output. This period is often called the Industrial Revolution because of the dramatic way that the growth of industries changed society. As with any other social transformation, however, these changes had elements of both light and darkness to them. And as we might expect, the Church took notice.
Observing the increase in child labor, unsafe working conditions, poverty, and extremely long working hours, Pope Leo XIII voiced his concern. In his encyclical Rerum Novarum (All Things New), the pope stated that “human beings are not to be used as mere instruments for money-making” (RN, 42). He said that owners of capital are obliged to look after the welfare of their employees, suppliers, and their customers.
Now this article is not meant to be about Rerum Novarum or the Industrial Revolution. We simply wanted to use this history to illustrate an important point about our own lives. Just as Leo XIII called for business owners to include a higher philosophy aimed at the common good, we too are called to include a higher philosophy in our decision making—a philosophy that considers God’s purposes and the welfare of those around us. Like the businessmen of the late nineteenth century, we too are called to resist the temptation to independence and autonomy, the temptation to do what we want to do without submitting ourselves to a higher authority.
So the question is, what steps can we take to ensure that we are making our decisions in light of a philosophy that incorporates the ways of Jesus and the teachings of his Church?
Of course, the kind of self-oriented and independent thinking that appeared during the Industrial Revolution was nothing new. St. Paul faced a similar challenge when he built the early Church. Time and again he told believers, “Do not conform yourselves to this age” (Romans 12:2). Repeatedly he said that as members of the Church we need to think and act as God’s holy people, and he warned about the consequences that self-centered thinking can have on the Church.
But Paul went beyond just exhorting people to think and act with God in mind. He offered them a way to do it as well. Paul urged believers to “test” their thoughts, to discern whether their decisions were in line with what God had revealed. “Test everything,” he said. Hold on only to “what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21).
Like these first Christians, we too need to test our thinking—something we are not often encouraged to do. We need to compare our thoughts with God’s thoughts. One way to do this is through good common sense, relying on virtues like honesty, fairness, and respect. It’s likely that most of us use this method. However, our decision-making is helped even more when we include a regular reading of Scripture. For example, Scripture tells us that “love of money,” not making money, is wrong (1 Timothy 6:10). It asks, “What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?” (Matthew 16:26). When we contemplate messages such as these, they can shape the way we spend, save, and donate the money we earn. Passages like these can help us avoid the trap of loving material possessions over people. They can help us see that we are simply stewards and not owners of this money.
It’s not only Scripture that we can use to test our thoughts and decisions. There are certain questions that Scripture just doesn’t answer. And for those, we have the gift of Sacred Tradition and the teaching office of the Church. For example, if we were to use only our good common sense, we might come to the conclusion that genetic research on frozen embryos is not a bad thing. After all, these embryos were not going to be used for anything else, and the research just might result in medical breakthroughs for people suffering from painful, debilitating diseases. Why shouldn’t scientists pursue the potential cures? Besides, Scripture doesn’t say anything about scientific research or medical progress.
While it’s true that the Bible has little to say directly on the matter of embryonic stem cells, the Church—drawing from Scripture, the teaching of the apostles, and the Sacred Tradition that has been entrusted to it—has much to say. The Church teaches that a human life is present from the moment of conception, and that to experiment on an embryo—especially if the experiment results in the death of this embryo—is to violate the dignity of this human life. Did the Church answer this challenge only by quoting Scripture? No, but by relying also on the work of scientists and theologians, the wisdom of the Church Fathers, and most importantly, by listening to the voice of the Spirit.
This is why it is important for us to remain in touch with the Church’s teachings. We do it not because we want to follow the latest controversy and not because we want to know whether our local bishop or the Holy Father agrees with us. Rather, we do it because we want to form our minds according to the mind of Christ. And the pope and the bishops united with him have been given a special commission—and a special grace—to continue to teach in the name of Jesus, just as Peter and the other apostles were commissioned. In fact, the term “Magisterium” comes from the Latin word magister, which means teacher.
When he returned from his missionary journeys, the first thing Paul always did was to meet with the elders of the Church to tell them what he saw and to discern with them where God was working and where things had not gone so well (Acts 14:27-28; 21:18-21). Paul felt the need for insight, discernment, and approval. He wanted his work to be guided by the Church. Likewise, when Peter returned from the house of Cornelius, he too explained what the Holy Spirit did, and he received blessings, support, and confirmation that what happened there really was God’s work (Acts 11:1-18).
These passages tell us that we can hear from the Lord. We can know his voice and be guided by his hand. They tell us also that while we can make good decisions by listening to his voice, we need to discern what we are hearing. We need to rely on Scripture and Tradition, trusting in the Magisterium of the Church to help guide us in our discernment.
Think of what happened when King David followed his own mind and had Uriah killed in battle so that he could marry Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:1-27). David didn’t acknowledge and deal with his sin until he was confronted by the prophet Nathan. How can this happen? Was David not a good man of God?
Similarly, Joseph’s brothers were good men of God, but they tried to kill their own brother out of sheer jealousy (Genesis 37:1-36). Rather than telling their father about their problems with Joseph—rather than submitting their thoughts to the man who had authority over them—they went ahead with their plan, bringing tragedy upon their whole family in the process. These stories tell us that we risk trouble when we follow our own minds without testing our thoughts against a higher source. They tell us that it is possible for good people to become misled and confused, often with painful results.
As we go about setting our goals and resolutions for the new year, let’s resolve to test ourselves. Let’s spend a little more time each day examining the ways we think and act. Let’s decide also to try our best to keep our thoughts and decisions in-line with the way Jesus wants us to live. St. Paul once told us: “Examine yourselves to see whether you are living in faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless, of course, you fail the test” (2 Corinthians 13:5). Let’s pray for the grace to pass the test!
How can we ensure a passing grade? The best way is to see Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium as gifts that provide important principles to help form our minds and guide our lives. These principles may not always give specific answers to the day-to-day decisions that we face. Nevertheless, the more firmly we build our lives on these principles, the more in tune we will become with the mind of Christ concerning how we should think and act, no matter what questions we face.
This is a daunting task, especially considering that we live in a world that questions or openly denies Jesus and his supremacy. We live in a world that questions the value of any authority, let alone the authority of Christ and his Church. But as we face this task, we have two promises from the Lord—promises that we can count on every day of our lives. First, he promised that he himself would be with us “always, until the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). And second, he promised that the Church—the great mystery that lifts us up to eternity even while we live on this earth—is able to withstand even the “gates of the netherworld” (16:18). With promises like these, we can have great hope and confidence.
Thirsty for God
Heaven and earth collide during prayer, and our earthly thirst is temporarily satiated by a heavenly spring.
I was out on my run one hot summer morning in Arizona.A mile in, I realized I’d forgotten my water bottle. “No problem,” I thought to myself. “I’ve done this run a hundred times. I’ll be fine.” Sadly, my pride-ridden brain forgot to inform my dehydrated body. By the time I turned the corner for mile number three, my legs began to lock up. I became dizzy and nauseated, and at one point, I’m certain the grim reaper was running beside me. Even my guardian angel was asking for a drink!
I made the mistake of thinking I could survive on my own—I didn’t need anything or anyone else. I was wrong. The proverb was correct: “Pride does (indeed) go before folly” (cf. Proverbs 16:18). And I’ve made similar mistakes in my Christian journey. The key to avoiding dehydration—physical or spiritual—is to have and drink water before you actually thirst.
Are You Thriving or Just Surviving?
We know our bodies were created with needs. But so were our souls. Creation is designed to need not just creation but the Creator. The One who breathes life into us loves us enough to design us with spiritual needs as well. We have not only a desire for the lifeblood of earth (food and water) but also for the lifeblood of heaven in prayer and sacrament. The question is this: do we want to merely survive or truly live?
In the famous encounter between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:4-42), the woman may have gone seeking water, but it was the Living Water—Jesus Christ—who approached asking for a drink. She, like many of us, had been in survival mode: spiritually dehydrated and used to it. It was not until she encountered the Lord that she began to comprehend the difference between surviving and thriving. As the Catechism of the Catholic Church reminds us,
The reality is that even when we pray, even when we put forth the effort, it is really still God pursuing us. Prayer is where earth and heaven collide. Prayer is where our earthly thirst is temporarily satiated by a heavenly spring. It is in prayer that light breathes into moments of darkness, hope vanquishes fear, peace shatters anxiety, and healing pours into every wound. Prayer does not eliminate our crosses, but it offers us a new perspective on them. Prayer is where the cross changes shoulders.
The Power of Proactive Prayer.
The more we pray, the more we will desire to do so. The sooner we realize the power of proactive prayer in the everyday, rather than “reactive” prayer in times of desperation, the more we will trust in the love and presence of God in our daily lives. We soon begin to see that prayer does not “help” our relationship with God; prayer is our relationship with God.
Any relationship, however, takes time and work; a relationship with God is no different. God is willing to fulfill his end. The Lord bids us to ask, seek, and knock (Matthew 7:7). Note that all three of those actions require effort on our part. That being said, he promises us that “when you ... pray to me, I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12), and we are reminded, “Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you” (James 4:8). God not only looks at you with great love, just as you are, but also wants you to know him as a trustworthy and faithful friend.
St. Augustine said we are all beggars before God. As such, humility really is the foundation of all prayer (CCC, 2559). The Holy Spirit wants to reward your act of openness. God will not be outdone in generosity. So before you venture into the unknown encounter God has in store for you, say a quick prayer. Give the Lord permission to speak to you in a new way. Ask the Lord to come dwell in you in new ways. Ask the Lord to illuminate your mind. Invite the Lord to occupy your heart. Invite the Lord to move in your soul ... in his time and according to his perfect plan.
Pray, “Come, Holy Spirit.” Repeat the phrase several times. The Lord is waiting for you. He is the Living Water, ready to satisfy your deepest thirst.
Mary, Mother of the Church
As mother of Life himself, Mary mediates the life of Christ to us as the new Eve, as the Mother of the Church, and finally, as our mother.
The New Eve
As the “woman” central to God’s plan of salvation, Mary is the “new Eve.” This is the very first title given to Mary in the writings of the Church fathers. St. Paul himself referred to Jesus as the “new Adam” (see Romans 5:14; 1 Corinthians 15:45). There is logic, then, in seeing Mary as the “new Eve” because of her role in giving life to all her spiritual children. We should also mention that the Church in a spiritual way is also called the “new Eve,” because the Church is the mystical bride of Jesus, the Bridegroom, just as the first Eve was the spouse of the first Adam.
The name Eve means “the mother of the living” (see Genesis 3:20). But because the first Eve was joined to the sin of the first Adam, her sin passed on not life but death to her children. This death was both physical and spiritual. Physical death means the death of the body. Before the original sin, our first parents enjoyed the gift of immortality. Death, however, was a punishment for their sin which was passed on to all their descendants. The body would die by being separated from the soul. But even after the death of the body, the soul retains the hope of being reunited to the body at the time of the Second Coming of Jesus. Spiritual death means that we, as children of the first Eve, were born without the life of God’s sanctifying grace in our souls. We could not redeem ourselves to gain back the life of grace we had lost because we couldn’t pay the price of our own redemption. Unless something happened, the gates of heaven were closed to us forever!
But Mary, as the new Eve, begins to reverse our helpless situation. She can do this because she is now joined to the redemptive work of her divine Son, the new Adam. Jesus came to bring us the fullness of life: “I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly” (John 10:10). Through his redemption, Jesus restores to us the life of grace that had been lost. This spiritual life is restored to the soul through Baptism. At the same time, through his bodily resurrection, Jesus promises to raise our bodies back to life when he returns in glory at the end of time. Because Mary was joined to her Son’s work so intimately, she is truly a mother who brings life to her spiritual children.
Mother of the Church
As the new Eve, the true mother of the living, Mary is the Mother of the Church. St. Paul refers to the Church as the mystical body of Christ. Jesus is the head, while we who are baptized are the members (see Ephesians 5:23). Head and members make up the fullness of Christ’s mystical body. In Bethlehem Mary gave birth to Jesus, our head.
On Calvary Mary became a mother again. Jesus addressed her as such when he said, “Woman, behold, your son” (John 19:26, NAB). To understand this mystical birth on Calvary, we have to look at the way John describes the death of Jesus. At dusk the Roman soldiers broke the legs of the two thieves crucified with Jesus. Breaking their legs hastened their deaths, because the only way to breathe on the cross was to lift oneself up by the legs to inhale. But when the soldiers came to Jesus, it was obvious that he was already dead. They did not break any of his bones, but to be sure that he was not alive, a centurion thrust his lance into Jesus’ side. John tells us that at that moment, blood and water came forth from the side of Christ (see John 19:31-34).
The early Church fathers saw this blood and water as symbols of the creation of the Church. Jesus is the new Adam. Mary is personally the new Eve, as the mother of the living members of Christ’s mystical body. The Church is also the new Eve as the mystical spouse of Jesus, the new Adam. Just as the first Eve was formed from Adam’s side in the garden of Eden, so the Church, as the new Eve, was formed from the side of Jesus on the cross at Calvary. The Genesis creation account says that God put Adam into a deep sleep, opened his side, took out one of his ribs, and formed Eve (see Genesis 2:21-22). The Church fathers saw a parallel to the Genesis creation in the gospel account of Jesus’ death. In their view, Jesus (the new Adam) was in the sleep of death on the cross, when his side was opened by the centurion’s lance, and out came blood and water, symbolizing the Church. The water represents the Sacrament of Baptism, which gives us the beginning of new life in Christ; the blood represents the Eucharist, which gives us Christ himself, the very author of our new life. As the two greatest sacraments, Baptism and the Eucharist represent the Church itself.
Archbishop Fulton Sheen said that since the Church was mystically “born” from the side of Christ, there was a birth taking place, and so there had to be a mother. Mary was present at the cross and received from her divine Son a new role as mother of the living: “Woman, behold, your son” (John 19:26, NAB). Woman—Jesus again uses that title in addressing his mother, just as he did at the wedding at Cana. There was a deeper reason for his use of the word “woman,” which we see when we look at Genesis. In the garden of Eden, God said to the serpent, who had just led the first Adam and the first Eve into sin,
When Jesus at Cana and again at Calvary called his mother “woman,” we can conclude that he was identifying Mary as the one who would be at enmity with the evil one (the devil) and whose offspring would do battle with the devil’s offspring.
When Jesus said to his mother as he was dying, “Woman, behold, your son,” he was also identifying Mary as our mother. In giving life to Christ, who is our head, Mary gives us life also, since the same life that is in the head is also present in us who are the members of his mystical body.
Our Mother
St. Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1167), a Cistercian abbot and a contemporary of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, explained Mary’s role as our spiritual mother:
We owe [Mary] honor, for she is the mother of our Lord. He who fails to honor the mother clearly dishonors the Son. Also, Scripture says: “Honor your father and your mother.”... Once we all lay in death, as you know and believe, in sin, in darkness, in misery. In death, because we had lost the Lord; in sin, because of our corruption; in darkness, for we were without the light of wisdom, and, thus had perished utterly. But then we were born, far better than through Eve, through Mary the blessed [one], because Christ was born of her. We have recovered new life in place of sin, immortality instead of mortality, light in place of darkness. She is our mother—the mother of our life [Jesus], the mother of our redemption [Jesus], the mother of our light [Jesus]. As the apostle [St. Paul] says of our Lord, “He became for us, by God’s power, our wisdom and justice, our holiness and redemption.” [Mary] then, as mother of Christ, is the mother of our wisdom and justice, of our holiness and redemption. She is more our mother than the mother of our flesh. Our birth from her is better, for from her is born our holiness, our wisdom, our justice, our sanctification, our redemption.
We all received new life in Christ, and Mary gave life to him by conceiving and giving birth to him. Therefore, we can say with St. Aelred that Mary gave us life also, since we share in the very life Christ received from her. In the mystical body, the life that is in Jesus our head flows into us who are his members. This makes Mary’s role for us one of being a mother of life. She is always spiritually mediating or transmitting life to us through and in Christ, who dwells within us.
This article is an excerpt from Following Mary to Jesus: Our Lady as Mother, Teacher, and Advocate by Fr. Andrew Apostoli, CFR.
A meditation on Luke 10:38-42: “You are worried and distracted by many things; there is need of only one thing.” —vv.41-42
In an informal survey, twenty women were asked to describe their lives in just one word. Over half of them said, “Busy!” Our age or stage of life doesn’t seem to matter; the common denominator is that we are all rushing around in an effort to get things done.
Maybe it’s because people today have so many activities. And when we multiply those activities by the number of people we are responsible for, life can get pretty complicated. In nearly every culture, women have been the organizers and managers of time within the family. We see from the story of Martha and Mary that even in biblical times, the women were expected to “run the show” within the household.
We modern-day Marthas are “dancing as fast as we can”—more out of necessity than choice. And like Martha, who among us hasn’t looked up to God and pleaded, “Lord, don’t you care that I am doing all the work?” Of course, he cares. However, Jesus definitely would give us the same answer he gave to his beloved friend two thousand years ago.
Jesus is telling us, just as he told Martha, that the “one thing” we need is him. When we put him first in line for our attention, our time, and our energy, the “busyness” of our days becomes more purposeful, less hectic, and more enjoyable.
This is an amazing spiritual paradox: the more time we give to Jesus, the more time we have to give. It’s the same multiplication principle that fed thousands with just two loaves and five fish. In fact, Jesus was probably pleased by the way Martha tried to make everything just right. He probably felt honored by her desire to serve him so graciously. So why did Jesus say what he said? Because he wanted Martha—and all of us—to know that there is a point where our tasks consume us, rob us of our peace, and separate us from God.
We are all guilty of being distracted. We are all guilty of working on the things we consider vital and important—only at the expense of our relationship with Jesus. But before you lose hope and conclude that you can’t manage all the distractions in your life, consider this: Jesus was tempted by one empty promise after another. He knows firsthand how difficult it is to resist temptation. He also knows how much we are tempted every day. Just think: Jesus knew all of this when he spoke to Martha, and still he called her to change. Evidently, Jesus believed that Martha could change. And what’s even more encouraging, we can bet that Jesus was ready to help Martha overcome her distractions—just as he stands ready even today to give us the grace we need to overcome.
So the next time you have two hours and fifteen different tasks to accomplish, take time to put Jesus first. Ask him to help you to slow down, put him first right now, and keep him first throughout your whole day. Thank him for his companionship, which he graciously offers you, even when you’re too busy to notice. Try to stop what you’re doing from time to time, and spend a moment thanking him for his help and presence in your life. You’ll be amazed at the results!
Passionate about the Passion
For centuries, drama and good storytelling have had the power to grab our imaginations and move us in our innermost hearts.
Even today, a gripping novel or a powerful movie can stay with us for a long time after we have finished it—and the very best have had so strong an impact that they have changed the way we think and act.
Of all the great stories that have been written, and of all the great dramas that have been acted out on stage or in a movie, none is more powerful than the story of Jesus Christ—especially his passion, death, and resurrection. Nothing can compare to this story in its ability to fill us with sadness as we see Jesus treated so harshly—or with excitement and hope as we see in his resurrection the defeat of sin and death and the promise of new life for all of us.
How many times, after meditating on the passion of the Lord, have you felt a lump in your throat, or even been moved to tears? How many times has some movie about Jesus affected you deeply and given you an overflowing sense of God’s love?
Why do we react this way? Because the Holy Spirit loves to bring the gospel to life for us, and he will use stories, movies, and drama to do that. We also react this way because deep down we recognize that the passion of Jesus is at the very core of our lives and of our faith. Deep down, in that place where the Spirit moves the most intimately, we see that God chose to save us and bring us back to him by giving up his only Son for us. It’s plausible that God could have chosen some other way to redeem us, but he chose the cross in part because of the way this gripping event dramatizes how deeply he loves us.
During this season of Lent, we want to encourage you to read the passion and ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten your mind as you meditate on the story. Ask the Spirit to give you divine insight and revelation that touches your heart as much as it teaches your mind. Tell him you want to experience a new depth of God’s love as you contemplate once more the story behind St. John’s famous words: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life” (John 3:16).
A Mystery of Hatred and Fear.
There are many different ways we can read the passion stories in the Gospels, but we want to look at these stories from two dimensions. We want to focus on the natural, psychological elements at play in the passion. But we also want to point out some of the more spiritual and theological aspects that are visible just beneath the surface of these Gospel stories.
As we read the Gospels, we can see that Jesus was put to death because his message was too radical for the religious and political leaders of Israel. It seemed that Jesus repeatedly alienated them with his words and his actions. He associated with Samaritans, he ate with tax collectors, and he reached out to prostitutes. While the leaders dismissed these people as undesirables and outcasts, Jesus saw them as beloved but wounded children of God—people who needed to be embraced, healed, and brought to new life.
Not only did Jesus scandalize these leaders by the company he kept, he went so far as to openly confront their hypocrisy. He accused them of appearing clean on the outside while allowing self-centeredness to reign on the inside (Matthew 23:25). He challenged them to stop building themselves up and to practice what they preached (23:3-7). He even asked them, “How can you escape being sentenced to hell?” (23:33). And as you might expect, the more boldly Jesus challenged them, the more intensely they hated him.
But Jesus did even more than challenge the Jewish leaders on a personal level. He challenged the way they were interpreting and teaching the laws of Moses. He defended his disciples when they were accused of breaking the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-8). He even “broke” the Sabbath himself by healing the sick at synagogue gatherings (12:9-14; Luke 13:10-17). He openly forgave the sins of an adulterous woman who, according to a strict interpretation of the law, should have been put to death (John 8:2-11). He even appeared to commit blasphemy when he told a paralyzed man that his sins had been forgiven (Mark 2:1-12).
Finally, when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, the Jewish rulers were pushed to their limit. They felt that had no choice but to eliminate this troublesome rabbi. “If we let him go on like this,” they reasoned, “everyone will believe in him and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation” (John 11:48). And so Caiaphas, the high priest, decided—both prophetically and ironically—that it was better “to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed” (11:50). And, as we all know, the rest is history.
A Mystery of Salvation.
And yet, while all this was going on between Jesus and Israel’s leaders, another conflict was raging—one that extended beyond the confines of one group or another and reached right up to the throne of God. Just about everyone who has read the passion can identify the injustice and the cruelty that Jesus experienced. We wonder why so many everyday Jews turned on him and why Pilate caved into the demands of the Sanhedrin. We wonder how anyone could justify killing a man who had dedicated his life to preaching peace, love, and mercy.
While nearly everyone can condemn such injustice, it takes another set of eyes to perceive the salvation that flowed out of it. Only through the eyes of faith can we see the cross as God’s perfect plan of salvation. Only as we ask the Spirit to open our hearts will we see in the passion the battle between light and darkness—and the victory that Jesus won for each of us.
As we meditate on the passion, we will come to see how much Jesus gave for our sake—both spiritually and physically. On the surface, it appeared that a few men devised an evil plan to put Jesus to death. And to a certain extent, this is correct. But on this deeper level of faith, we can see how Satan entered Judas and convinced him to betray Jesus to the authorities. And if we look at other aspects of the passion, such as Peter’s denial and the intense hatred of his enemies, we will also be able to see the devil’s influence behind these human actions and decisions. In all of these strategies, Satan’s goal was to isolate Jesus and weaken him to the point where he would turn away from God’s plan and fall into sin himself. Satan knew that if he could get Jesus to deny his Father just once, our salvation would be jeopardized, and his hold over us would go unthreatened.
Praying the Passion.
As we delve into the mystery of the passion this Lent, let’s imagine ourselves with Jesus during the final hours of his life. The closer we can get to the reality of these events, the more we will appreciate what Jesus did for us.
How can you get the most out of pondering the passion? By asking the Holy Spirit to help you see the spiritual battle that was raging even as the political and personality struggles were taking place. Ask him to show you how the lies of Satan, the power of sin, and the darkness in the human heart all played a part in Jesus’ suffering and death. Even more importantly, ask him to show you the perfection of God’s plan to save us and redeem us from these influences. Finally, ask the Spirit to show you how you can apply the message of the passion to your life.
Scripture tells us about a woman who—a short time before Jesus’ final Passover—anointed him with precious and costly perfume (Mark 14:1-9). Let’s take her act of love and devotion as a model for the way we can respond to Jesus this Lent. As responsible stewards, we can always ask how we can best use the “costly ointment” of our lives for good: to serve the poor, to help educate others, or to take care of our families. These are always good questions to ask. But love never calculates. It never relies only on good reason. Its one desire is to give as much as it can for the beloved and then ask, “How can I give more?” This woman loved Jesus so much that she poured out—even “wasted”—the most valuable thing she owned on him.
Logic tells us to be prudent and economical. Love tells us to “waste” ourselves for those we love. Of course we should be logical and use the gift of reason that God gave us. But when it comes to our relationship with Jesus, logic needs to take a back seat to love.
As you journey through this Lenten season, ask the Holy Spirit to draw you deeper into the heart of Christ—every time you receive the Eucharist, every time you pray, and every time you read the passion. Let the mystery of Jesus’ death sink into your heart. As the beauty and power of this great drama pierces you, give Jesus the best gift you can give: Pour out your life on him in love, adoration, and obedience.
Jesus Awaits Us in the Eucharist
Selections from Homilies by Pope Benedict XVI
This year’s feast of Corpus Christi falls on Sunday, June 14.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, many of us have had to go weeks or months without receiving the Eucharist. This has been very difficult for all of us, but it has also helped us to grow more in appreciation for this life-giving sacrament. These homilies by Pope Benedict XVI can help us reflect on the amazing gift of Jesus in the Eucharist.
Do We Desire to Receive Jesus?
“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22:15). With these words, Jesus began the celebration of his final meal and the institution of the Holy Eucharist. Jesus approached that hour with eager desire. In his heart he awaited the moment when he would give himself to his own under the appearance of bread and wine. He awaited that moment, which would in some sense be the true messianic wedding feast: when he would transform the gifts of this world and become one with his own, so as to transform them and thus inaugurate the transformation of the world. In this eager desire of Jesus, we can recognize the desire of God himself—his expectant love for mankind, for his creation. A love that awaits the moment of union, a love that wants to draw mankind to itself and thereby fulfill the desire of all creation, for creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the children of God (cf. Romans 8:19). Jesus desires us, he awaits us.
But what about ourselves? Do we really desire him? Are we anxious to meet him? Do we desire to encounter him, to become one with him, to receive the gifts he offers us in the Holy Eucharist? Or are we indifferent, distracted, busy with other things? From Jesus’ banquet parables, we realize that he knows all about empty places at table, invitations refused, lack of interest in him and his closeness. For us the empty places at the table of the Lord’s wedding feast, whether excusable or not, are no longer a parable but a reality in those very countries to which he had revealed his closeness in a special way. Jesus also knew about guests who come to the banquet without being robed in the wedding garment—they come not to rejoice in his presence but merely out of habit, since their hearts are elsewhere.
In one of his homilies, St. Gregory the Great asks: Who are these people who enter without the wedding garment? What is this garment and how does one acquire it? He replies that those who are invited and enter do in some way have faith. It is faith that opens the door to them. But they lack the wedding garment of love. Those who do not live their faith as love are not ready for the banquet and are cast out. Eucharistic communion requires faith, but faith requires love; otherwise, even as faith, it is dead... .
“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you.” Lord, you desire us, you desire me. You eagerly desire to share yourself with us in the Holy Eucharist, to be one with us. Lord, awaken in us the desire for you. Strengthen us in unity with you and with one another. Grant unity to your Church, so that the world may believe. Amen.
Making A Sacrifice of Ourselves
The outpouring of Christ’s blood is the source of the Church’s life. St. John, as we know, sees in the water and blood that flowed from our Lord’s body the wellspring of that divine life that is bestowed by the Holy Spirit and communicated to us in the sacraments (John 19:34; cf. 1 John 1:7; 5:6-7). The Letter to the Hebrews draws out, we might say, the liturgical implications of this mystery. Jesus, by his suffering and death, his self-oblation in the eternal Spirit, has become our high priest and “the mediator of a new covenant” (Hebrews 9:15). These words echo our Lord’s own words at the Last Supper, when he instituted the Eucharist as the sacrament of his body, given up for us, and his blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins (cf. Mark 14:24; Matthew 26:28; Luke 22:20).
Faithful to Christ’s command to “do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), the Church in every time and place celebrates the Eucharist until the Lord returns in glory, rejoicing in his sacramental presence and drawing upon the power of his saving sacrifice for the redemption of the world. The reality of the Eucharistic sacrifice has always been at the heart of Catholic faith... .
The Eucharistic sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ embraces, in turn, the mystery of our Lord’s continuing passion in the members of his mystical body, the Church, in every age. The crucifix serves as a reminder that Christ, our eternal high priest, daily unites our own sacrifices, our own sufferings, our own needs, hopes, and aspirations to the infinite merits of his sacrifice. Through him, with him, and in him, we lift up our own bodies as a sacrifice “holy and acceptable to God” (Romans 12:1). In this sense we are caught up in his eternal oblation, completing, as St. Paul says, “in our flesh what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, ... the Church” (Colossians 1:24). In the life of the Church, in her trials and tribulations, Christ continues, in the stark phrase of Pascal, “to be in agony until the end of the world” (Pensées, éd. Léon Brunschvicg [Paris: Hachette, 1905], 553).
Heaven Comes Down to Earth
St. John Mary Vianney liked to tell his parishioners, “Come to communion... . It is true that you are not worthy of it, but you need it.” With the knowledge of being inadequate because of sin but needful of nourishing ourselves with the love that the Lord offers us in the Eucharistic sacrament, let us renew our faith in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. We must not take this faith for granted! Today we run the risk of secularization creeping into the Church too. It can be translated into formal and empty Eucharistic worship, into celebrations lacking that heartfelt participation that is expressed in veneration and in respect for the liturgy. The temptation to reduce prayer to superficial, hasty moments, letting ourselves be overpowered by earthly activities and concerns, is always strong.
When, in a little while, we recite the Our Father, the prayer par excellence, we will say, “Give us this day our daily bread,” thinking, of course, of the bread of each day for us and for all peoples. But this request contains something deeper. The Greek word epioúsios that we translate as “daily” could also allude to the “superstantial” bread, the bread “of the world to come.” Some Fathers of the Church saw this as a reference to the Eucharist, the bread of eternal life, the new world that is already given to us in Holy Mass, so that from this moment the future world may begin within us. With the Eucharist, therefore, heaven comes down to earth, the future of God enters the present, and it is as though time were embraced by divine eternity.
Stay with us, Jesus. Make a gift of yourself and give us the bread that nourishes us for eternal life! Free this world from the poison of evil, violence, and hatred that pollute consciences, and purify it with the power of your merciful love. And you, Mary, who were the woman “of the Eucharist” throughout your life, help us to walk united toward the heavenly goal, nourished by the Body and Blood of Christ, the eternal Bread of life and medicine of divine immortality. Amen!
Mary, Woman of the Eucharist
May Mary most holy, the Immaculate Virgin, ark of the new and eternal covenant, accompany us on our way to meet the Lord who comes. In her we find realized most perfectly the essence of the Church. The Church sees in Mary—“Woman of the Eucharist,” as she was called by Pope John Paul II—her finest icon, and she contemplates Mary as a singular model of the Eucharistic life... . She is the tota pulchra, the all-beautiful, for in her the radiance of God’s glory shines forth. The beauty of the heavenly liturgy, which must be reflected in our own assemblies, is faithfully mirrored in her. From Mary we must learn to become men and women of the Eucharist and of the Church, and thus to present ourselves, in the words of St. Paul, “holy and blameless” before the Lord, even as he wished us to be from the beginning (cf. Colossians 1:22; Ephesians 1:4).
Through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, may the Holy Spirit kindle within us the same ardor experienced by the disciples on the way to Emmaus (cf. Luke 24:13-35) and renew our “Eucharistic wonder” through the splendor and beauty radiating from the liturgical rite, the efficacious sign of the infinite beauty of the holy mystery of God. Those disciples arose and returned in haste to Jerusalem in order to share their joy with their brothers and sisters in the faith. True joy is found in recognizing that the Lord is still with us, our faithful companion along the way. The Eucharist makes us discover that Christ, risen from the dead, is our contemporary in the mystery of the Church, his body. Of this mystery of love we have become witnesses. Let us encourage one another to walk joyfully, our hearts filled with wonder, toward our encounter with the Holy Eucharist so that we may experience and proclaim to others the truth of the words with which Jesus took leave of his disciples: “Lo, I am with you always, until the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20).
If Today You Hear His Voice
The Holy Spirit takes our “head knowledge” and fills it with his grace.
We know the stories: Adam and Eve; Cain and Abel; Jacob and Esau.
We know the words: “God so loved the world ... ;” “Whatsoever you do to the least of my people ... ;” “God is love.” We even know the commandments: “You shall not kill;” “Honor your father and mother;” “You shall not covet.”
Because so many of us grew up with these stories and commandments, they have woven themselves into the fabric of our lives. Have you ever noticed, for example, how readily words and phrases from the Bible trip off our tongues? How easy it is to say, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” or “Pride goeth before the fall.”
This is all quite impressive, but in our heavenly Father’s mind, this “formation” aspect of Scripture is just the beginning of what he wants to do through his word. God didn’t create us simply to be upright people with well-ordered lives. He didn’t intend the Bible to be just a rule book to guide us while he watched from afar. He wants to have a relationship with us. He wants to speak to us here and now—and he does it through Scripture.
Unlike any other book ever written, the Bible is “living and active” (Hebrews 4:12). Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Scripture has the power to bring God himself into our lives. Listen, for instance, to Moses as he addresses the Israelites just as they are about to enter the Promised Land. He tells them that the word of God ...
is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away. It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?” Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?” No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart. (Deuteronomy 30:11-14)
God has written his words in our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33), and every time we seek his voice in Scripture, our hearts respond with encouragement, hope, and trust that God truly is with us. As St. Augustine once prayed, “O Lord, you pierced me with your word, and I loved you.”
Many centuries after Moses exhorted the Israelites, one of the psalmists reminded his people about Israel’s checkered history during their desert wanderings:
God had spoken clearly and dramatically to their ancestors on Mount Sinai centuries earlier, and yet this psalmist seems to take it for granted that God wanted to speak to them again “today,” and every day. Clearly, there could be no “today” if God were not still speaking to his people. There could only be “back then,” when God spoke to Moses— or in our case, “back then,” when Jesus walked the earth.
So how do we hear God’s voice today? What can we do to ensure that we come out of prayer or Mass and say with great confidence: “God spoke to me today”? To find an answer, we need look no further than the Book of Psalms, the Bible’s own guide to prayer. At its very outset—the first two verses of the first psalm itself—we see a recipe for hearing God and knowing the blessings of his presence:
The key to hearing God speak to us in Scripture is the art of meditation. It is found in the practice of reading, studying, and dwelling prayerfully on a passage from Scripture until we hear God speaking to us personally through those words.
While it may seem at first as if meditation is free flowing and without any form, experience shows that we do better with a set method or approach to keep us from unfocused wool gathering. Don’t assume that you can meditate on Scriptures when you’re driving your car, running errands, or taking a jog in the park. The more you focus your attention on God, the easier it will be to hear his voice. So choose a time when you are most alert. And find a place that is both comfortable and free from distractions or clutter.
Whatever passage you choose, be careful not to make it too long. The goal of meditation is not to memorize or examine a part of Scripture but to listen to God speak to your heart. And for that, less is more. Many people choose one of the readings from the daily liturgy. Others choose to work slowly through a gospel or a New Testament letter.
Once you have gathered your thoughts and calmed your mind, go ahead and read the passage you have chosen. Take your time. Be deliberate and careful in your reading. Read it over several times until you feel comfortable with what the verses are saying. If you come across a puzzling word or phrase, turn to a commentary or your Bible’s notes for help. But don’t spend too much time on this. Do only what is necessary to resolve any confusion, and then get back to prayer.
Don’t try to force anything in your meditation. Instead, be still and listen for God’s voice. Listen for any impression that these words make. Are they stirring your heart with hope? Are they pointing out an area of darkness that you need to bring into the light of Confession? Are they comforting you or encouraging you or filling you with a sense of gratitude and love? Are they moving you to take some kind of action, whether in dealing with a habit of your own or in helping you with a close relationship?
No matter what God says or how he says it to you, his words will always be accompanied by a sense of immediacy and intimacy. This is not something that we can manufacture. It is a gift we can only receive with gratitude, humility, and love. It comes only as we calm our racing minds and wait to hear what God wants to tell us.
In his 1893 encyclical letter, Providentissimus Deus, Pope Leo XIII wrote, “Sacred Scripture is not like other books. Dictated by the Holy Spirit, it contains things of the deepest importance, which in many instances are most difficult and obscure. To understand and explain such things there is always required the ‘coming’ of the same Holy Spirit; that is to say, his light and his grace” (5).
With these words, Pope Leo taught that when the Holy Spirit opens our eyes and reveals the truths of God, this revelation has the power to change us. The “light and grace” of God open our minds and our hearts to his presence and help us to see him in a new and awe-inspiring light. As we meditate on Scripture, the Spirit gives us a glimpse of God as he truly is: all-powerful; absolutely holy; and perfectly wise, loving, and just.
St. Jerome, one of the Church’s greatest Scripture scholars, described his experience of the Holy Spirit in Scripture this way:
What food, what honey could be sweeter than to learn of God’s Providence, to enter into his shrine and look into the mind of the Creator, to listen to the Lord’s words at which the wise of this world laugh, but which really are full of spiritual teaching? (Epistle to Paula, 30.13)
For our part, when we read Scripture and meditate upon it prayerfully, we begin to see Jesus as the pearl of great price and the path for our lives (Matthew 13:46; Psalm 119:105). We experience a longing in our heart to stay close to Jesus no matter the cost. All because the Holy Spirit has taken our “head knowledge”—our insights into God—and filled them with his grace. What was once in our minds has moved into our hearts, giving us the joy of knowing Jesus, the peace of experiencing his salvation, and a desire to love God in return for everything he has done for us.
Brothers and sisters, God loves to speak to the deepest part of our hearts. He loves to reveal his truth, confirm his love, and teach us his ways. May we never tire of listening for his voice and receiving his revelation!
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you. (2 Corinthians 13:13)
Catholic apologist Frank J. Sheed described the relationship of the Holy Spirit to the Father and Son:
Father and Son love each other, with infinite intensity. What we could not know, if it were not revealed to us, is that they unite to express their love, and that expression is a third divine Person... . Each gives Himself wholly to the outpouring of His love for the Other, holding nothing back—indeed the very thought of holding back is ridiculous; if They give Themselves at all, They can give Themselves only totally—They possess nothing but Their totality! The uttered love of Father and Son is infinite, lacks no perfection that They have, is God, a Person, a Someone[—the Holy Spirit.]
The Holy Spirit has sometimes been called the “neglected” Person of the Trinity, the One who is “lonely.” Perhaps because he is referred to as “Spirit,” we find ourselves unable to imagine him, as we can Jesus. But we must rid ourselves of all such thoughts. Instead, we must embrace the truth that the Holy Spirit is God, a Person who fully shares life with the Father and the Son. Getting that straight prepares the way for us to come to know and love him more.
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. (Galatians 5:22-23)
Many Christians regard love, joy, peace, and the other fruit of the Spirit as feelings, and they are disappointed when they try to stir them up. However, St. Paul presents the fruit of the Spirit not as feelings but primarily as behaviors that replace the works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21). For example, acts of love correct hateful conduct, peaceful initiatives calm fighting, patient behaviors replace angry outbursts, exercising self-control checks lustful acts, and so on. We receive these behaviors when we ask the Holy Spirit for the grace to conduct ourselves as Jesus would. Then we perform the actions that manifest the fruit of the Spirit. For example, to grow in love, we must do the loving thing in every situation, serving even someone we do not like. The Spirit will honor our repeating of this behavior by producing the fruit of love in us.
We recognize the works of the flesh in our lives and feel doomed to repeat them over and over. But we don’t have to: the Holy Spirit brings us antidotes that we can use to break free of them. May you face evil inclinations and persistent sinful patterns by expecting the Holy Spirit to give you the grace to overcome them, and may you replace them with the fruit of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit will help you to see clearly the works of the flesh in your life and will give you the grace to replace your evil behaviors with the fruit of the Spirit.
Too Busy to Pray?
You do have time to pray—it’s “shockingly simple,” honest, intimate communication with God.
One of my earliest memories is of something I never want to forget: my mother teaching me to pray.
I was three or four years old, and it was still early evening when my mother tucked me into bed in my room, in our house on Morgal Street, Rockville, Maryland. She whispered, “Say your prayers. You know how to pray? You do it like this”:
Angel of God, my guardian dear,
To whom God’s love commits me here,
Ever this day, be at my side
To light, to guard, to rule, to guide. Amen.
And that was how it began.
Now, nearly sixty years later, I look back on that time and it seems so simple. Life was simple, yes. But so was praying. There’s a plainness and purity to that prayer, with all those short, easy words and the unabashedly humble request: Guardian Angel, take care of me. G’night.
As I got older, prayer became more challenging—the Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, then the Memorare and assorted chaplets, and then the Rosary, the Creed, the Prayer of St. Francis, and on and on and on. Oh, the Rosary! How I remember the May Procession at St. Peter’s Catholic School, walking around in the May sun, reciting decade after decade, and the ancient and grim-faced Sister Irenaeus, swathed in black, pummeling the organ as we sang “Immaculate Mary” and “Hail, Holy Queen.” Did praying have to be that hard? And hot? Did it have to be done in the heat?
Many years later, when I was ordained as a deacon, I discovered the Liturgy of the Hours and praying the psalms, the Magnificat, and Benedictus.
These are all part of the glorious legacy of the Church, and every Catholic should be familiar with them. But not everyone has the inclination—or, significantly, the time—to pray.
And there’s the rub.
Let’s face it: in a world where soccer practice, work, the gym, PTA meetings, school projects, Twitter, and Netflix dominate our lives, it can be challenging and seemingly impossible to find time to pray. There are deadlines to meet, bills to pay, babies to diaper, reports to file, gardens to weed, emails to answer, groceries to buy. And praying? Talking to God? Amid the stresses and strains of daily life, many of us take God’s name in vain, if we mention him at all.
We want to pray, but who has the time?
Well ... you. You do. Yes, you. The busy person who can’t find your keys or this week’s grocery list can, in fact, find time to pray. It is not impossible. If you’re reading this right now, you want to know how you can do what you feel called to do, what you want to do, but that you somehow can’t find the opportunity to do: pray. To offer up a good word to our good God. To stay connected to the Creator in a way that is fruitful and intimate and will nourish the soul—and just maybe do some good.
How can I do that? you’re wondering.
Glad you asked.
There is a way to pray when you feel you just can’t. (Yes, you can. Really.) Building a steady and fulfilling prayer life can be done, even if you think it can’t.
But be forewarned: I offer here no magic formulas, no easy solutions. This isn’t like one of those diets where you can “sleep” the pounds away. You will have to do some work. But as St. Benedict put it when he wrote his famous Rule, I’m hoping this won’t be “harsh or burdensome.”
The best prayer is an act of love. At its root, it really should be deceptively, almost shockingly, simple.
I’m a writer, journalist, blogger, storyteller, preacher, husband, and deacon – a busy person who is still trying to make time to pray. It isn’t easy. Believe me, I know. But I hope to offer some ideas on how to get started. The best prayer is an act of boundless surrender and joy, communicating with God in a way that is unique, intimate, and utterly honest. It is an act of love. And at its root, it really should be deceptively, almost shockingly, simple.
“Angel of God, my Guardian dear ...”
Yes, that simple.
I hope you’ll find this helpful, something that will encourage more prayer—a stepping-stone that will, as a famous prayer to the Holy Spirit puts it, “Enkindle ... the fire of God’s love.”
Ready to strike a match and start the flame? Then let us pray. “Holy Spirit, help me to pray today.”
Living in the Spirit
The Promise of New Life
Living life in the Spirit is a privilege we can experience right now
The thought of the Holy Spirit can seem very obscure to us as we face the many challenges of our lives. Is it possible to know the Spirit in a real and life-changing way? Can we really hope that the Spirit will be our “Comforter,” just as he was the first disciples’ Comforter (John 14:16-18)?
The answer, in short, is “Yes!” The Spirit can work in our lives on a down-to-earth, practical basis, transforming sinful thoughts and habits into a godly and holy life. The Spirit can bring alive your prayer so that you can touch the throne of God, and can enable you “to share in the inmost life of God” (St. John Paul II, Tertio Millennio Adveniente, 8). This Pentecost, may the Spirit of God move in your life, in your family, and in your parish.
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, our highest goal in life—our highest calling—is to experience “Life in the Spirit” (CCC, 1699). As lofty as this may sound, life in the Spirit is possible for each one of us because through Christ we can “participate in the light and the power of the divine Spirit” (CCC, 1704). Jesus, who is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15), always lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:18). Now, through his death and resurrection, he has given us his Holy Spirit so that we too can live as he lived (Romans 8:15-16). This is the wonder of the gospel: Through faith in Jesus Christ, we can enter into the life of God. We can live a new life!
What Is Life in the Spirit?
Life in the Spirit is the capacity— given to us by God—to follow Jesus’ example (CCC, 1709). What was Jesus’ example? Every day of his life, he sought the power of the Holy Spirit to do his Father’s will. Everything Jesus said and did came from his union with God, a union that only the Spirit could sustain.
As it was for Jesus, so can it be for us as we allow the Spirit to direct our thoughts and actions. We call this “living in the Spirit” because we cannot sustain such a life on our own. We are all sinners. We all need God desperately. The good news is that God invites all of us to experience life in the Spirit. All he asks is that we pray, follow his commands, and check our disposition during the day. In return, he promises to fill us with his Spirit every day.
The key ingredient in our attempts at life in the Spirit is the experiential knowledge that God loves us, that Jesus has saved us, and that the Holy Spirit lives in us. The Holy Spirit in us wants to move us to live each day under his influence, and the only way we will follow him is if we know the love of God that surpasses all fears and anxieties (Romans 8:37-39).
Welcoming the Spirit in Prayer
Prayer—conversation with God—is the first priority of living in the Spirit. We all know that it takes time and commitment to build true and lasting friendships. In the same way, we grow close to God as we spend time in prayer opening our hearts to him and listening to his voice. The more we are committed to prayer, the more we will know what it is like to live in the Father’s heart. Why? Because prayer makes us sensitive to the Holy Spirit.
Throughout his letters, St. Paul encouraged his readers to pray constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17; see Colossians 3:16; Ephesians 5:18-20; Philippians 4:4-7). Constant prayer means not only praying every day, but also taking a few moments at different points in our day to turn our hearts to God. Through constant prayer, we give the Holy Spirit freedom to move in us. We come to know what he likes and what he dislikes. We learn how to discern his voice and how to please him.
Constant prayer also makes us sensitive to the word of God and to the Eucharist. Praying with the scriptures opens our minds to God and makes our hearts burn with love for him (Luke 24:32). We all have heard the saying, “You are what you eat.” Spiritually, the more we eat the bread of Christ with prayerful hearts, the more we will think and act like Jesus. Constant prayer—at home or at Mass, whether we are reading the scriptures or driving to work—is our secret to intimacy with God. Prayer, flowing from a pure heart, is the best way we can learn to be led by the Spirit.
The Spirit Softens Our Hearts
As we learn to pray constantly, we will begin to discover changes in our interior disposition. Perhaps we will become more patient. The Spirit may show us areas of sin and lead us to confess them to God and repent. Perhaps we will become less anxious or less prone to anger and resentment. All of this happens because the Holy Spirit is filling us with God’s grace and warming our hearts with his love. Such an infilling moves us to love God in return and to obey him. It gives us a greater confidence that we can share in his life.
Another essential part of living in the Spirit is allowing our thoughts, our decisions, and our emotions to flow from our experience of God. As St. Paul described life in the Spirit, he contrasted it with life “in the flesh”—a life driven by the sinful desires of our fallen nature (Romans 8:8). Paul wrote, “Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit” (8:5). In another letter, Paul distinguished the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace—from the work of the flesh—envy, rivalry, lust, and selfishness (Galatians 5:19-23). Paul called the life in the flesh hostility toward God, and life in the Spirit openness and obedience to the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:6-7).
St. Paul taught a simple lesson: Our outward behavior reveals our inner disposition. As we learn to listen to the Holy Spirit, we will find ourselves acting in accord with the Holy Spirit during the day. Some of this will occur naturally as our hearts are softened by the Spirit. However, much of this change occurs as we make decisions in the course of the day to obey God’s commands and to follow the promptings of his Spirit.
This is why it is important that we remain close to God and call on the Spirit often during our days. The more opportunities we give God to mold us and shape us in his image, the more we will reflect his love and his power to those around us.
Growing in Discernment
We all know that we are not perfect. We all sin. Perhaps the best way for us to learn whether we are acting in accord with the Spirit is by examining our hearts and our actions. In extreme circumstances, we can easily discern our state. We may be in a foul mood all day or find ourselves caught up in lust or envy. Perhaps we tear down a friend or our spouse through gossip. These are all sure signs that we are far from the Lord and need to turn back to him.
Likewise, there are times when we can easily tell that we are in the Spirit. Perhaps, after having received the Eucharist, we are full of love. We may feel an inner desire to serve God in some parish ministry. Maybe we feel a deep compassion for the poor or the sick, or we find it easier to forgive those who have hurt us.
However, we are also familiar with the countless thoughts, actions, and behavior patterns that fall somewhere in between these two extremes. In these cases, it can be quite difficult to determine whether they are of the Spirit or not. These “gray areas” require the gift of discernment—a gift of the Spirit to help us perceive more clearly what is motivating us. Discernment is a wonderful gift that we can grow in as we practice following the Spirit every day.
The Spirit Says, “Come!”
No matter who we are—rich or poor, intellectual or laborer—God invites you to live close to his heart. This is a privilege that comes as we yield our lives to the Spirit. Living in the Spirit requires that we allow our interior disposition to be formed by the Spirit so that we come to reflect the love and compassion of our heavenly Father.
Five Practical Ways to Look to the Spirit
Every morning, ask for a fresh “filling” of the Holy Spirit, and greater sensitivity to, and power from, the Holy Spirit.
Take some time to recall and write out those moments in your life when you experienced the Spirit consoling you or teaching you.
Share your faith with others. Ask the Spirit for wisdom, courage, and love.
“Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God” (Luke 6:20). Let the Spirit – the Father of the Poor – give you a deep, generous love for those in need.
Pray for unity among believers, because the Spirit imparts gifts and charisms for the whole body of Christ.
Encountering the God Who Speaks
Three Keys to Hearing God’s Voice
Life is full of questions: What is the key to happiness? Why do bad things happen to good people? What is my purpose on this earth? Why is there evil in the world? In a world that values quick fixes, it can be unsettling to confront questions like these—complex questions that cannot be solved with simple slogans or one-word answers.
Pope Benedict XVI tells us that as much as we may like quick answers, we can gain clarity on the enigmas of life only as we take the time to immerse ourselves in the word of God. So in this article, we want to look at how we can meet Jesus, the living Word of God, in the Bible, which is the written word of God. We want to make three practical recommendations that will help us hear God’s own voice and sense his presence as we ponder his word in Scripture.
Read Every Day!
“May every day of our lives thus be shaped by a renewed encounter with Christ, the Word of the Father made flesh.” (VD, 124)
The first step sounds obvious, but it’s one that we can often overlook: Set aside time to read the Scriptures every day. Schedule it in your day. Do it first thing in the morning. Become familiar with the story of the Bible so that you can see how God has worked throughout the ages. Discover for yourself how patiently God has worked, teaching us his ways and preparing us for the coming of the Lord. And don’t be afraid to use reliable commentaries and Bible studies to help you. The more you know about the background, history, and context of the Bible, the better you can piece together its story.
But be sure that as you are reading and studying, you are also praying and searching. As Pope Benedict emphasized, we can meet Jesus in the words of Scripture. We can develop a deep relationship with him as we let his words sink into our hearts.
This doesn’t happen overnight. Like any relationship, it takes time. Think of any close friendship you have. Didn’t you and your friend grow to appreciate each other as you spent time together? Didn’t you become attached to each other as you shared the highs and lows of your lives? You grew to love each other because of the way you shared your hopes and fears, your dreams and disappointments.
There is no substitute for time. Relationships take time. Communication takes time. Love takes time. And so we need to be reading Scripture every day so that we can get to know God. How does he think about things? How does he react to hardship or to good fortune? What makes him happy or sad? What are his dreams and hopes?
Become Part of the Scriptures.
“The word of God draws each of us into a conversation with the Lord: the God who speaks teaches us how to speak to him.” (VD, 24)
As you read every day, try to imagine yourself in whatever scene you are reading. When he read the Gospels, St. Ignatius of Loyola would often picture himself as one of Jesus’ disciples so that he could observe closely everything that was going on. He would imagine himself as an extra witness at the Last Supper, drinking in everything around him as Jesus offered the first Eucharist. He would look closely at Jesus’ face as he forgave the woman caught in adultery or as he challenged the Pharisees and Sadducees. He would join Mary Magdalene and the apostle John at Calvary and observe the sights and sounds of the day when Jesus died for him.
Inserting ourselves in the Scriptures this way shouldn’t be a passive thing. We shouldn’t just sit back and watch what is happening. We can become part of the scene as well. For instance, as you picture yourself on Mount Horeb with Moses and the burning bush, feel free to ask Moses what it felt like to hear God’s voice. Imagine him turning to you and sharing with you what he was thinking when God told him to con- front Pharaoh and demand that he release the Jewish people. You just may be surprised at the answers you get!
Be sure not to limit yourself just to the stories in the Bible. Benedict himself encourages us to do the same thing with the psalms, which have been called the Bible’s own prayer book:
In the Psalms we find expressed every possible human feeling set masterfully in the sight of God.
... In this way our word to God becomes God’s word ... and our whole existence becomes a dialogue with the God who speaks and listens. (VD, 24) Imagine yourself as one of the psalmists as you bring your heart before the Lord. And like the psalmists, be bold enough to expect an answer from God. In place of the psalmist’s concerns, insert your own needs and desires, your own longings and hopes. Let his words of praise and thanksgiving become your own. As Benedict said, God’s words will then become your words. His thoughts will become your thoughts. His ways will become your ways, pushing aside anything in you that is opposed to his way of thinking.
Slow Down and Listen.
“Only in silence can the word of God find a home in us, as it did in Mary, woman of the word and, inseparably, woman of silence.” (VD, 66)
Placing yourself in the Bible this way may feel like nothing more than playing make-believe at first. How can you tell if the things you are picturing are coming from your own imagination or from God? The key here is through quiet listening.
We live in a very noisy, active world, and all that activity can influence our time with the Scriptures. It can be tempting, as you are placing yourself in a scene from the Bible, to lose sight of your goal and let your imagination run away with you. You may end up spending all your time picturing the scene in detail, imagining the people’s reactions, and letting the story continue to unfold. But all this imaginative activity has to be balanced with silence and stillness. How else will you be able to hear God’s voice?
If a particular word or phrase or image catches your attention, stop and dwell on it. Slow down. Take your time. Don’t worry about getting to the end of the story or the end of the psalm. Instead, mull over it. Wait for the Lord to speak to you. It could be as simple as Jesus’ words “Have faith in God” at the Last Supper (John 14:1), or it could be as involved as Paul’s statement that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved (Romans 10:13). Whatever it is, take time to let it unfold. Repeat the word or phrase over and over again, asking the Lord what he wants to say to you. Write down any impressions you may have. Quiet your heart, breathe deeply, and receive whatever God wants to give you.
If the thoughts that come to you fill you with peace, joy, hope, or a desire to be more like Jesus, you can be sure that the Holy Spirit is speaking to you. If the thoughts make you feel anxious, frustrated, or immersed in guilt, then you can be sure they aren’t from God.
If the thoughts that come to you move you to act differently, to act more like the Lord, then you can be confident that God is behind them. For instance, you may feel moved to show extra kindness to a friend or family member. You may be compelled to confess a past sin that has been heavy on your conscience. You may find new courage to get involved in a parish ministry. Or you may feel the need to mend a wounded friendship. Whatever you sense God asking you to do, step out and do it. More often than not, you’ll find that one simple step leads to another and another—each one drawing you closer to the Lord.
In the introduction to his exhortation, Pope Benedict tells us:
There is no greater priority than this: to enable the people of our time once more to encounter God, the God who speaks to us and shares his love so that we might have life in abundance. (VD, 2)
With these words, Benedict is telling us that the key to a full, fruitful, and peaceful life lies in hearing God speak his word to us. He is telling us how deeply our heavenly Father wants to open our eyes to his presence and his love. All we have to do is let his word take root in our hearts. Life is full of questions, just as Benedict XVI told us. How good it is to know that we can find the answers as we ask Jesus, God’s full and perfect Word, to speak to us!
The Powerful Effects of Intercessory Prayer
Bringing God’s Power and Peace into Our Lives
Two meditations that illustrate the power of prayer in the life of others and ours.
The Power of Our Prayers
My young son and I enjoy playing by a little stream near our house. One pleasant afternoon, his little wooden boat (actually just a disk of wood) got stuck on top of a large flat rock in the stream. Not missing a beat, he grabbed a stick and reached way over the water trying to dislodge it with the stick. Unfortunately, his stick was too short. Reaching out just a little too far, he lost his balance and fell into the stream hands first.
Amazingly, the slight change in water level and the redirecting of water currents from his hands thrusting into the water were just enough to lift his boat off the rock and set it free. Without ever touching the boat, my son’s actions freed the boat from being snagged and allowed it to continue on its way downstream.
Watching this scene unfold from the opposite side of the stream, I suddenly understood the effects of intercessory prayer. As it was with my son and his stick, oftentimes it is beyond our reach to give direct help to someone who has run into a snag in life. However, in some mystical way God has set up the spiritual realm like a body of water. Our diving into the water with prayers, petitions, praises, and sacrifices changes the course of the spiritual currents, effecting change for those who need help by bringing God’s peace into stressful or chaotic situations.
Imagine someone doing a cannonball into a backyard pool. Everything floating in the pool is affected by the waves and the rise in water level. In a lighthearted way, we could call intercessory prayer a “spiritual cannonball” and understand why it is that the more often we “jump” (pray), the better. All the more reason to “jump” higher and harder!
When I begin to doubt the effectiveness of intercessory prayer, I recall my son’s falling in the stream and how it set his little boat free. Then I resolve to do some spiritual cannonballs!
Lord Jesus, you are my peace. Help me to delight in knowing that prayer works! Remind me to do “spiritual cannonballs” for peace in the world, in my community, in my home, and in my heart.
The Snares of the Devil
It is a habit in some parishes to pray the Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel at the end of each Mass. It is a short but powerful prayer:
I especially love two images in this prayer. The word “snares” reminds me that very few of us run around wantonly breaking the Ten Commandments by stealing rampantly or murdering people. And yet we are all sinners. Big temptations to sin are on our radar like bear traps on a hiking path. We can see and usually avoid them. Little temptations to sin are like the snares used for rabbits and skunks. They are covered up by leaves, off to the side, and easily overlooked. Both traps and snares are set for us by the devil, by our own flesh, and by the world. But big or small, no matter what their origin, temptations to sin trip us up on the road to living peaceful, God-fearing lives.
And then there is the second image: “All the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.” This reminds me that our enemy has minions who, like him, do not want us to live in peace. In the same way that the devil doesn’t care if I commit a thousand little sins or one big one, as long as I turn my back on God, the devil isn’t above having someone else do his dirty work.
I’m not really the warrior type, but saying the Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel, especially as a congregation in church, really gives me peace. It strengthens my faith and sharpens my desire to stay close to the Lord.
Lord Jesus, you are my peace. Help me to stay alert to the snares of the devil through frequent prayer and the awareness of your power and ability to protect me.
The Resurrection of Jesus
The Holy Spirit convinces us of the realities of our faith.
Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” Peter then came out with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. (John 20:1-9)
The gospel reading from John may seem odd, because we hear only part of the story of the resurrection. Neither Mary Magdalene or the disciples encounter the risen Lord. Yet such a reading can bring their experience closer to ours. During the course of this Passover weekend, the disciples’ faith was stretched greatly. Until they encountered the risen Christ, they could only hope and trust in his promise that he would rise.
Similarly, we ourselves have not encountered the risen Christ in the flesh. So this is a time of faith for us as well. Yet, unlike these first disciples, we do not have to wait with anxiety and fear. We have the Holy Spirit living in us to give us confidence that the resurrection is real. Our faith in Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, comes from the Spirit. It is he who convinces us of realities that we will not see until the final day of the Lord.
That’s why Easter is such a day of celebration: The Holy Spirit is making Jesus’ resurrection real to us! He wants to bring us the freedom from sin that Jesus accomplished on the cross. We are no longer slaves to sin. We don’t have to see Jesus with our eyes; we can receive him in our hearts! Even death cannot overcome us!
We have the opportunity today to go beyond an intellectual faith to a faith that is living in our hearts. Christ is risen! He has cleansed us of every sin. We will not die; we will live with him forever! If you have not experienced this indescribable joy, today is the day to start. The Holy Spirit is ready to show you the love and power of God. Today is the day to experience these glorious truths in a way that will cause you to shout aloud: “He is risen!” The words will ring with meaning for you if you ask the Spirit to reveal them to your heart.
In prayer, ask the Lord to show you how the resurrection of his Son can affect you in a tangible way. In what ways can the risen Christ be manifested in you and through you?
Whatever trials or struggles you may be experiencing in your life right now, ask the Holy Spirit to give you a deep sense of joy today, especially as you receive the body and blood of Jesus in the Eucharist.
Spend some time meditating on these words of St. Anselm: “You were a bond-slave and by this man you are free. By him you are brought back from exile; lost, you are restored; dead, you are raised.”
Jesus, what words of praise can I offer you? Death has been swallowed up in your victory. Your divine life is now alive within me. Lord Jesus, I will love and praise you forever!
