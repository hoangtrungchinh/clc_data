In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behaviour: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so forth.
These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a religious being:
But this "intimate and vital bond of man to God" can be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man.
Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.
"Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice."
Although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness.
But this search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, "an upright heart", as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God.
Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him.
These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging and convincing arguments", which allow us to attain certainty about the truth.
These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a twofold point of departure: the physical world, and the human person.
The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.
The human person: with his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself about God's existence.
In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul.
the soul, the "seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material", can have its origin only in God.
The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end.
Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality which is the first cause and final end of all things, a reality "that everyone calls God".
Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God.
But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith.
the proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.
"Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason."
Without this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God's revelation.
Man has this capacity because he is created "in the image of God".
In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone:
This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God's revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding, but also "about those religious and moral truths which of themselves are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present condition of the human race, they can be known by all men with ease, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error".
Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is equally so.
We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of knowing and thinking.
All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most especially man, created in the image and likeness of God.
the manifold perfections of creatures - their truth, their goodness, their beauty all reflect the infinite perfection of God.
Consequently we can name God by taking his creatures" perfections as our starting point, "for from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator".
God transcends all creatures.
We must therefore continually purify our language of everything in it that is limited, imagebound or imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God --"the inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable"-- with our human representations.
Our human words always fall short of the mystery of God.
Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does attain to God himself, though unable to express him in his infinite simplicity.
Likewise, we must recall that "between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude"; and that "concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him."
Man is by nature and vocation a religious being.
Coming from God, going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God.
When he listens to the message of creation and to the voice of conscience, man can arrive at certainty about the existence of God, the cause and the end of everything.
The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of human reason ,
We really can name God, starting from the manifold perfections of his creatures, which are likenesses of the infinitely perfect God, even if our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery.
Without the Creator, the creature vanishes .
This is the reason why believers know that the love of Christ urges them to bring the light of the living God to those who do not know him or who reject him.
By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of his works.
But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation.
Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself to man.
This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men.
God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
"It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and to make known the mystery of his will.
His will was that men should have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature."
God, who "dwells in unapproachable light", wants to communicate his own divine life to the men he freely created, in order to adopt them as his sons in his only-begotten Son.
By revealing himself God wishes to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him and of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity.
The divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously "by deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other" and shed light on each another.
It involves a specific divine pedagogy: God communicates himself to man gradually.
He prepares him to welcome by stages the supernatural Revelation that is to culminate in the person and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ.
In the beginning God makes himself known
"God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word, provides men with constant evidence of himself in created realities.
and furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation - he manifested himself to our first parents from the very beginning."
He invited them to intimate communion with himself and clothed them with resplendent grace and justice.
This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin.
"After the fall, buoyed them up with the hope of salvation, by promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his solicitude for the human race.
For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who seek salvation by patience in well-doing."
After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once sought to save humanity part by part.
the covenant with Noah after the flood gives expression to the principle of the divine economy toward the "nations", in other words, towards men grouped "in their lands, each with own language, by their families, in their nations".
The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel.
The Bible venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel the just, the king-priest Melchisedek - a figure of Christ - and the upright "Noah, Daniel, and Job".
Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity that can be reached by those who live according to the covenant of Noah, waiting for Christ to "gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad".
The people descended from Abraham would be the trustee of the promise made to the patriarchs, the chosen people, called to prepare for that day when God would gather all his children into the unity of the Church.
They would be the root on to which the Gentiles would be grafted, once they came to believe.
The patriarchs, prophets and certain other Old Testament figures have been and always will be honoured as saints in all the Church's liturgical traditions.
God forms his people Israel
After the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by freeing them from slavery in Egypt.
He established with them the covenant of Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law so that they would recognize him and serve him as the one living and true God, the provident Father and just judge, and so that they would look for the promised Saviour.
Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope of salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant intended for all, to be written on their hearts.
The prophets proclaim a radical redemption of the People of God, purification from all their infidelities, a salvation which will include all the nations.
Above all, the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this hope.
Such holy women as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Judith and Esther kept alive the hope of Israel's salvation.
the purest figure among them is Mary.
God has said everything in his Word
"In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son."
Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father's one, perfect and unsurpassable Word.
In him he has said everything; there will be no other word than this one.
St. John of the Cross, among others, commented strikingly on Hebrews :-:
There will be no further Revelation
"The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been made completely explicit; it remains for Christian faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course of the centuries.
Throughout the ages, there have been so-called "private" revelations, some of which have been recognized by the authority of the Church.
They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith.
It is not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but to help live more fully by it in a certain period of history.
Guided by the Magisterium of the Church, the sensus fidelium knows how to discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of Christ or his saints to the Church.
Christian faith cannot accept "revelations" that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment, as is the case in certain nonChristian religions and also in certain recent sects which base themselves on such "revelations".
By love, God has revealed himself and given himself to man.
He has thus provided the definitive, superabundant answer to the questions that man asks himself about the meaning and purpose of his life.
God has revealed himself to man by gradually communicating his own mystery in deeds and in words.
God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and with all living beings .
It will remain in force as long as the world lasts.
God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him and his descendants.
By the covenant God formed his people and revealed his law to them through Moses.
Through the prophets, he prepared them to accept the salvation destined for all humanity.
God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he has established his covenant for ever.
the Son is his Father's definitive Word; so there will be no further Revelation after him.
God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth": that is, of Christ Jesus.
Christ must be proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this revelation may reach to the ends of the earth:
In keeping with the Lord's command, the Gospel was handed on in two ways:
This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though closely connected to it.
Through Tradition, "the Church, in her doctrine, life and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she herself is, all that she believes."
"The sayings of the holy Fathers are a witness to the life-giving presence of this Tradition, showing how its riches are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her belief and her prayer."
"Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit."
Apostolic Tradition and ecclesial traditions
The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit.
the first generation of Christians did not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process of living Tradition.
Tradition is to be distinguished from the various theological, disciplinary, liturgical or devotional traditions, born in the local churches over time.
These are the particular forms, adapted to different places and times, in which the great Tradition is expressed.
In the light of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the guidance of the Church's Magisterium.
The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church
Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: "He who hears you, hears me", The faithful receive with docility the teachings and directives that their pastors give them in different forms.
The Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds from Christ to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is, when it proposes truths contained in divine Revelation or also when it proposes in a definitive way truths having a necessary connection with them.
There is an organic connection between our spiritual life and the dogmas.
Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they illuminate it and make it secure.
Conversely, if our life is upright, our intellect and heart will be open to welcome the light shed by the dogmas of faith.
The mutual connections between dogmas, and their coherence, can be found in the whole of the Revelation of the mystery of Christ.
"In Catholic doctrine there exists an order or hierarchy of truths, since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith."
The supernatural sense of faith
All the faithful share in understanding and handing on revealed truth.
They have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, who instructs them and guides them into all truth.
Growth in understanding the faith
Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow in the life of the Church:
- "through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts"; it is in particular "theological research which deepens knowledge of revealed truth".
- "from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which believers experience", The sacred Scriptures "grow with the one who reads them."
"It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrangement of God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture and the Magisterium of the Church are so connected and associated that one of them cannot stand without the others.
Working together, each in its own way, under the action of the one Holy Spirit, they all contribute effectively to the salvation of souls."
What Christ entrusted to the apostles, they in turn handed on by their preaching and writing, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to all generations, until Christ returns in glory.
"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God" in which, as in a mirror, the pilgrim Church contemplates God, the source of all her riches.
"The Church, in her doctrine, life and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she herself is, all that she believes" .
Thanks to its supernatural sense of faith, the People of God as a whole never ceases to welcome, to penetrate more deeply and to live more fully from the gift of divine Revelation.
The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the Magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the bishops in communion with him.
In order to reveal himself to men, in the condescension of his goodness God speaks to them in human words: "Indeed the words of God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like human language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he took on himself the flesh of human weakness, became like men."
Through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks only one single Word, his one Utterance in whom he expresses himself completely:
For this reason, the Church has always venerated the Scriptures as she venerates the Lord's Body.
She never ceases to present to the faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of God's Word and Christ's Body.
In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nourishment and her strength, for she welcomes it not as a human word, "but as what it really is, the word of God".
"In the sacred books, the Father who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children, and talks with them."
God inspired the human authors of the sacred books.
"To compose the sacred books, God chose certain men who, all the while he employed them in this task, made full use of their own faculties and powers so that, though he acted in them and by them, it was as true authors that they consigned to writing whatever he wanted written, and no more."
The inspired books teach the truth.
"Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures."
In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way.
To interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to what the human authors truly wanted to affirm, and to what God wanted to reveal to us by their words.
In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the reader must take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, speaking and narrating then current.
"For the fact is that truth is differently presented and expressed in the various types of historical writing, in prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of literary expression."
But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and no less important principle of correct interpretation, without which Scripture would remain a dead letter.
"Sacred Scripture must be read and interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was written."
Be especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole Scripture".
Different as the books which compose it may be, Scripture is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus is the center and heart, open since his Passover.
The phrase "heart of Christ" can refer to Sacred Scripture, which makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as the Scripture was obscure.
But the Scripture has been opened since the Passion; since those who from then on have understood it, consider and discern in what way the prophecies must be interpreted.
Be attentive to the analogy of faith.
By "analogy of faith" we mean the coherence of the truths of faith among themselves and within the whole plan of Revelation.
A medieval couplet summarizes the significance of the four senses:
"It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules, towards a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church to form a firmer judgement.
For, of course, all that has been said about the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to the judgement of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word of God."
The Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacred Scripture.
Its books are divinely inspired and retain a permanent value, for the Old Covenant has never been revoked.
Indeed, "the economy of the Old Testament was deliberately SO oriented that it should prepare for and declare in prophecy the coming of Christ, redeemer of all men."
"Even though they contain matters imperfect and provisional, The books of the OldTestament bear witness to the whole divine pedagogy of God's saving love: these writings "are a storehouse of sublime teaching on God and of sound wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful treasury of prayers; in them, too, the mystery of our salvation is present in a hidden way."
Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of God.
the Church has always vigorously opposed the idea of rejecting the Old Testament under the pretext that the New has rendered it void .
The Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures "because they are our principal source for the life and teaching of the Incarnate Word, our Saviour".
We can distinguish three stages in the formation of the Gospels:
The fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as is evident both in the veneration which the liturgy accords it and in the surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all times:
But above all it's the gospels that occupy my mind when I'm at prayer; my poor soul has so many needs, and yet this is the one thing needful.
I'm always finding fresh lights there; hidden meanings which had meant nothing to me hitherto.
The unity of the Old and New Testaments
Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the fulfilment of the divine plan when "God will be everything to everyone."
Nor do the calling of the patriarchs and the exodus from Egypt, for example, lose their own value in God's plan, from the mere fact that they were intermediate stages.
"and such is the force and power of the Word of God that it can serve the Church as her support and vigour, and the children of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a pure and lasting fount of spiritual life."
Hence "access to Sacred Scripture ought to be open wide to the Christian faithful."
"All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and that one book is Christ, because all divine Scripture speaks of Christ, and all divine Scripture is fulfilled in Christ" .
"The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and, because they are inspired, they are truly the Word of God" .
God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its human authors; he acts in them and by means of them.
He thus gives assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth .
Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be attentive above all to what God wants to reveal through the sacred authors for our salvation.
What comes from the Spirit is not fully "understood except by the Spirit's action' .
The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the books of the Old Testament and the books of the New.
The four Gospels occupy a central place because Christ Jesus is their centre.
"The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she venerated the Body of the Lord" : both nourish and govern the whole Christian life.
"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path" .
To obey in faith is to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because its truth is guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself.
Abraham is the model of such obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture.
the Virgin Mary is its most perfect embodiment.
Abraham - "father of all who believe"
The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of Israel's ancestors, lays special emphasis on Abraham's faith: "By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go."
By faith, he lived as a stranger and pilgrim in the promised land.
By faith, Sarah was given to conceive the son of the promise.
and by faith Abraham offered his only son in sacrifice.
The Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith.
the Letter to the Hebrews proclaims its eulogy of the exemplary faith of the ancestors who "received divine approval".
Yet "God had foreseen something better for us": the grace of believing in his Son Jesus, "the pioneer and perfecter of our faith".
Mary - "Blessed is she who believed"
The Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience of faith.
By faith Mary welcomes the tidings and promise brought by the angel Gabriel, believing that "with God nothing will be impossible" and so giving her assent: "Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word."
Elizabeth greeted her: "Blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord."
It is for this faith that all generations have called Mary blessed.
Throughout her life and until her last ordeal when Jesus her son died on the cross, Mary's faith never wavered.
She never ceased to believe in the fulfilment of God's word.
and so the Church venerates in Mary the purest realization of faith.
To believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God
For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his "beloved Son", in whom the Father is "well pleased"; God tells us to listen to him.
The Lord himself said to his disciples: "Believe in God, believe also in me."
We can believe in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made flesh: "No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known."
Because he "has seen the Father", Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him.
The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in one only God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
When St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus declared to him that this revelation did not come "from flesh and blood", but from "my Father who is in heaven".
Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him.
"Before this faith can be exercised, man must have the grace of God to move and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the Holy Spirit, who moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the eyes of the mind and 'makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth.'"
Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.
But it is no less true that believing is an authentically human act.
Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has revealed is contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason.
Even in human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other persons tell us about themselves and their intentions, or to trust their promises to share a communion of life with one another.
If this is so, still less is it contrary to our dignity to "yield by faith the full submission of... intellect and will to God who reveals", and to share in an interior communion with him.
In faith, the human intellect and will co-operate with divine grace: "Believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the divine truth by command of the will moved by God through grace."
"Faith seeks understanding": it is intrinsic to faith that a believer desires to know better the One in whom he has put his faith, and to understand better what He has revealed; a more penetrating knowledge will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love.
the grace of faith opens "the eyes of your hearts" to a lively understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of the totality of God's plan and the mysteries of faith, of their connection with each other and with Christ, the centre of the revealed mystery.
"The same Holy Spirit constantly perfects faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may be more and more profoundly understood."
In the words of St. Augustine, "I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe."
Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation.
"Since "without faith it is impossible to please " and to attain to the fellowship of his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification, nor will anyone obtain eternal life 'But he who endures to the end.'"
Faith - the beginning of eternal life
Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific vision, the goal of our journey here below.
Then we shall see God "face to face", "as he is".
So faith is already the beginning of eternal life:
It is then we must turn to the witnesses of faith: to Abraham, who "in hope... believed against hope"; to the Virgin Mary, who, in "her pilgrimage of faith", walked into the "night of faith" in sharing the darkness of her son's suffering and death; and to so many others: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith."
Faith is a personal act - the free response of the human person to the initiative of God who reveals himself.
But faith is not an isolated act.
No one can believe alone, just as no one can live alone.
You have not given yourself faith as you have not given yourself life.
the believer has received faith from others and should hand it on to others.
Our love for Jesus and for our neighbour impels us to speak to others about our faith.
Each believer is thus a link in the great chain of believers.
I cannot believe without being carried by the faith of others, and by my faith I help support others in the faith.
"I believe" is the faith of the Church professed personally by each believer, principally during Baptism.
"We believe" is the faith of the Church confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more generally by the liturgical assembly of believers.
"I believe" is also the Church, our mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches us to say both "I believe" and "We believe".
Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive the life of faith through the Church, she is our mother: "We believe the Church as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church as if she were the author of our salvation."
Because she is our mother, she is also our teacher in the faith.
We do not believe in formulae, but in those realities they express, which faith allows us to touch.
"The believer's act of faith does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities which they express."
All the same, we do approach these realities with the help of formulations of the faith which permit us to express the faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate and live on it more and more.
The Church, "the pillar and bulwark of the truth", faithfully guards "the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints".
She guards the memory of Christ's words; it is she who from generation to generation hands on the apostles' confession of faith.
As a mother who teaches her children to speak and so to understand and communicate, the Church our Mother teaches us the language of faith in order to introduce us to the understanding and the life of faith.
Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures, peoples and nations, the Church has constantly confessed this one faith, received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and Father.
St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a witness of this faith, declared:
We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Faith is a supernatural gift from God.
In order to believe, man needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.
"Believing" is a human act, conscious and free, corresponding to the dignity of the human person.
"Believing" is an ecclesial act.
the Church's faith precedes, engenders, supports and nourishes our faith.
the Church is the mother of all believers.
"No one can have God as Father who does not have the Church as Mother" .
We believe all "that which is contained in the word of God, written or handed down, and which the Church proposes for belief as divinely revealed" .
Faith is necessary for salvation.
the Lord himself affirms: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned" .
"Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us blessed in the life to come" .
Whoever says "I believe" says "I pledge myself to what we believe."
Communion in faith needs a common language of faith, normative for all and uniting all in the same confession of faith.
From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and handed on her faith in brief formulae normative for all.
But already very early on, the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of her faith into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for candidates for Baptism:
The Greek word symbolon meant half of a broken object, for example, a seal presented as a token of recognition.
the broken parts were placed together to verify the bearer's identity.
the symbol of faith, then, is a sign of recognition and communion between believers.
Symbolon also means a gathering, collection or summary.
A symbol of faith is a summary of the principal truths of the faith and therefore serves as the first and fundamental point of reference for catechesis.
The first "profession of faith" is made during Baptism.
the symbol of faith is first and foremost the baptismal creed.
Since Baptism is given "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit", The truths of faith professed during Baptism are articulated in terms of their reference to the three persons of the Holy Trinity.
and so the Creed is divided into three parts: "the first part speaks of the first divine Person and the wonderful work of creation; the next speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery of his redemption of men; the final part speaks of the third divine Person, the origin and source of our sanctification."
These are "the three chapters of our baptismal seal".
"These three parts are distinct although connected with one another.
According to a comparison often used by the Fathers, we call them articles.
Indeed, just as in our bodily members there are certain articulations which distinguish and separate them, so too in this profession of faith, the name "articles" has justly and rightly been given to the truths we must believe particularly and distinctly."
In accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested to by St. Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the Creed as twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith by the number of the apostles.
Through the centuries many professions or symbols of faith have been articulated in response to the needs of the different eras: the creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches, e.g., the Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed; The professions of faith of certain Councils, such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons, Trent; or the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi or the Credo of the People of God of Paul VI.
None of the creeds from the different stages in the Church's life can be considered superseded or irrelevant.
They help us today to attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the different summaries made of it.
Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church's life:
The Apostles' Creed is so called because it is rightly considered to be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith.
It is the ancient baptismal symbol of the Church of Rome.
Its great authority arises from this fact: it is "the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter the first of the apostles, to which he brought the common faith".
The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its great authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecumenical Councils .
It remains common to all the great Churches of both East and West to this day.
Our presentation of the faith will follow the Apostles' Creed, which constitutes, as it were, "the oldest Roman catechism".
the presentation will be completed however by constant references to the Nicene Creed, which is often more explicit and more detailed.
This Creed is the spiritual seal, our heart's meditation and an ever-present guardian; it is, unquestionably, the treasure of our soul.
Our profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First and the Last, The beginning and the end of everything.
the Credo begins with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine person of the Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of heaven and earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God's works.
"I believe in God": this first affirmation of the Apostles' Creed is also the most fundamental.
the whole Creed speaks of God, and when it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in relation to God.
the other articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining Commandments make the first explicit.
the other articles help us to know God better as he revealed himself progressively to men.
"The faithful first profess their belief in God."
These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed begins.
the confession of God's oneness, which has its roots in the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the profession of God's existence and is equally fundamental.
God is unique; there is only one God: "The Christian faith confesses that God is one in nature, substance and essence."
Jesus himself affirms that God is "the one Lord" whom you must love "with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength".
At the same time Jesus gives us to understand that he himself is "the Lord".
To confess that Jesus is Lord is distinctive of Christian faith.
This is not contrary to belief in the One God.
Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit as "Lord and giver of life" introduce any division into the One God:
We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there is only one true God, eternal infinite and unchangeable, incomprehensible, almighty and ineffable, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or nature entirely simple.
"The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever."
"and now, O LORD God, you are God, and your words are true"; this is why God's promises always come true.
God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive.
This is why one can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of his word in all things.
the beginning of sin and of man's fall was due to a lie of the tempter who induced doubt of God's word, kindness and faithfulness.
God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created order and governs the world.
God, who alone made heaven and earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created thing in relation to himself.
In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive for choosing them from among all peoples as his special possession: his sheer gratuitous love.
and thanks to the prophets Israel understood that it was again out of love that God never stopped saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.
God's love is "everlasting": "For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you."
Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you."
But St. John goes even further when he affirms that "God is love": God's very being is love.
By sending his only Son and the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost secret: God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange.
Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all our being has enormous consequences for our whole life.
It means coming to know God's greatness and majesty: "Behold, God is great, and we know him not."
Therefore, we must "serve God first".
It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One, everything we are and have comes from him: "What have you that you did not receive?"
"What shall I render to the LORD for all his bounty to me?"
It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: everyone is made in the image and likeness of God.
It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us away from him
It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in adversity.
A prayer of St. Teresa of Jesus wonderfully expresses this trust:
Faith in God leads us to turn to him alone as our first origin and our ultimate goal, and neither to prefer anything to him nor to substitute anything for him.
Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery beyond words: "If you understood him, it would not be God" .
The God of our faith has revealed himself as HE WHO IS; and he has made himself known as "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness" .
God's very being is Truth and Love.
This paragraph expounds briefly how the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was revealed, how the Church has articulated the doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and how, by the divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfils the "plan of his loving goodness" of creation, redemption and sanctification.
The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology and economy .
"Theology" refers to the mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life.
Through the oikonomia the theologia is revealed to us; but conversely, the theologia illuminates the whole oikonomia.
God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works.
So it is, analogously, among human persons.
A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the "mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God".
To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament.
But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel's faith before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit.
The Father revealed by the Son
Many religions invoke God as "Father".
the deity is often considered the "father of gods and of men".
In Israel, God is called "Father" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.
Even more, God is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel, "his first-born son".
God is also called the Father of the king of Israel.
Most especially he is "the Father of the poor", of the orphaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection.
Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his relationship to his only Son who, reciprocally, is Son only in relation to his Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"; as "the image of the invisible God"; as the "radiance of the glory of God and the very stamp of his nature".
Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first ecumenical council at Nicaea that the Son is "consubstantial" with the Father, that is, one only God with him.
The second ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in , kept this expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed "the only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father".
The Father and the son revealed by the spirit
The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in time.
the Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had returned to the Father.
The sending of the person of the Spirit after Jesus' glorification reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy Trinity.
The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed confessed in at Constantinople.
But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it dogmatically in , even before Rome, in at the Council of Chalcedon, came to recognize and receive the Symbol of .
the use of this formula in the Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin liturgy .
the introduction of the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox Churches.
The formation of the Trinitarian dogma
From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally by means of Baptism.
It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal faith, formulated in the preaching, catechesis and prayer of the Church.
Such formulations are already found in the apostolic writings, such as this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify her Trinitarian faith, both to deepen her own understanding of the faith and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it.
This clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the theological work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the Christian people's sense of the faith.
The Church uses the term "substance" to designate the divine being in its unity, the term "person" or "hypostasis" to designate the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and the term "relation" to designate the fact that their distinction lies in the relationship of each to the others.
The dogma of the Holy Trinity
The divine persons are really distinct from one another.
"God is one but not solitary."
"Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son."
They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."
The divine Unity is Triune.
The divine persons are relative to one another.
Because it does not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one another: "In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both.
While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one nature or substance."
Indeed "everything is one where there is no opposition of relationship."
"Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son."
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called "the Theologian", entrusts this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of Constantinople:
Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine economy makes known both what is proper to the divine persons, and their one divine nature.
Hence the whole Christian life is a communion with each of the divine persons, without in any way separating them.
Everyone who glorifies the Father does so through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does so because the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him.
The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of God's creatures into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.
But even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy Trinity: "If a man loves me", says the Lord, "he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him":
The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian life.
God alone can make it known to us by revealing himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, which means that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is one and the same God.
The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son and by the Son "from the Father" , reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God.
"With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified" .
"The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from the communion of both the Father and the Son" .
By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit", we are called to share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light .
"Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal" .
Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do.
But within the single divine operation each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, especially in the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is named in the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our lives.
We believe that his might is universal, for God who created everything also rules everything and can do everything.
God's power is loving, for he is our Father, and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it "is made perfect in weakness".
"He does whatever he pleases"
"You are merciful to all, for you can do all thing"
The mystery of God's apparent powerlessness
Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by the experience of evil and suffering.
God can sometimes seem to be absent and incapable of stopping evil.
But in the most mysterious way God the Father has revealed his almighty power in the voluntary humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he conquered evil.
Christ crucified is thus "the power of God and the wisdom of God.
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
It is in Christ's Resurrection and exaltation that the Father has shown forth "the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe".
Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's almighty power.
This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to draw to itself Christ's power.
The Virgin Mary is the supreme model of this faith, for she believed that "nothing will be impossible with God", and was able to magnify the Lord: "For he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name."
"Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God.
Once our reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that the Creed will afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be great and marvellous things, far above the ordinary laws of nature."
With Job, the just man, we confess: "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted" .
Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses her prayer to the "almighty and eternal God" , believing firmly that "nothing will be impossible with God" .
If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how can we believe that the Father could create us, the Son redeem us and the Holy Spirit sanctify us?
Creation is the foundation of "all God's saving plans," the "beginning of the history of salvation" that culminates in Christ.
Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the mystery of creation and reveals the end for which "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth": from the beginning, God envisaged the glory of the new creation in Christ.
The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that God in his tenderness wanted to reveal to his People everything that is salutary to know on the subject.
Beyond the natural knowledge that every man can have of the Creator, God progressively revealed to Israel the mystery of creation.
He who chose the patriarchs, who brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by choosing Israel created and formed it, this same God reveals himself as the One to whom belong all the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he is the One who alone "made heaven and earth".
Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation and forging of the covenant of the one God with his People.
Creation is revealed as the first step towards this covenant, the first and universal witness to God's all-powerful love.
and so, the truth of creation is also expressed with growing vigour in the message of the prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy, and in the wisdom sayings of the Chosen People.
Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three chapters of Genesis occupy a unique place.
From a literary standpoint these texts may have had diverse sources.
the inspired authors have placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express in their solemn language the truths of creation - its origin and its end in God, its order and goodness, the vocation of man, and finally the drama of sin and the hope of salvation.
Read in the light of Christ, within the unity of Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the Church, these texts remain the principal source for catechesis on the mysteries of the "beginning": creation, fall, and promise of salvation.
God creates by wisdom and love
God creates "out of nothing"
Scripture bears witness to faith in creation "out of nothing" as a truth full of promise and hope.
Thus the mother of seven sons encourages them for martyrdom:
God creates an ordered and good world
God transcends creation and is present to it
God is infinitely greater than all his works: "You have set your glory above the heavens."
Indeed, God's "greatness is unsearchable".
But because he is the free and sovereign Creator, the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures' inmost being: "In him we live and move and have our being."
In the words of St. Augustine, God is "higher than my highest and more inward than my innermost self".
God upholds and sustains creation
With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves.
He not only gives them being and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and brings them to their final end.
Recognizing this utter dependence with respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and confidence:
Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator.
the universe was created "in a state of journeying" toward an ultimate perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it.
We call "divine providence" the dispositions by which God guides his creation toward this perfection:
And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any secondary causes.
This is not a "primitive mode of speech", but a profound way of recalling God's primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the world, and so of educating his people to trust in him.
the prayer of the Psalms is the great school of this trust.
Providence and secondary causes
God is the sovereign master of his plan.
But to carry it out he also makes use of his creatures' co-operation.
This use is not a sign of weakness, but rather a token of almighty God's greatness and goodness.
For God grants his creatures not only their existence, but also the dignity of acting on their own, of being causes and principles for each other, and thus of co-operating in the accomplishment of his plan.
In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the first and universal witness to his almighty love and his wisdom, the first proclamation of the "plan of his loving goodness", which finds its goal in the new creation in Christ.
Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father in particular, it is equally a truth of faith that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of creation.
God alone created the universe, freely, directly and without any help.
No creature has the infinite power necessary to "create" in the proper sense of the word, that is, to produce and give being to that which had in no way possessed it to call into existence "out of nothing") .
God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his Word, the Son "upholding the universe by his word of power" , and by his Creator Spirit, the giver of life.
Divine providence consists of the dispositions by which God guides all his creatures with wisdom and love to their ultimate end.
Divine providence works also through the actions of creatures.
To human beings God grants the ability to co-operate freely with his plans.
The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil is a mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus Christ who died and rose to vanquish evil.
Faith gives us the certainty that God would not permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very evil, by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.
The Scriptural expression "heaven and earth" means all that exists, creation in its entirety.
It also indicates the bond, deep within creation, that both unites heaven and earth and distinguishes the one from the other: "the earth" is the world of men, while "heaven" or "the heavens" can designate both the firmament and God's own "place" - "our Father in heaven" and consequently the "heaven" too which is eschatological glory.
Finally, "heaven" refers to the saints and the "place" of the spiritual creatures, the angels, who surround God.
The existence of angels - a truth of faith
The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred Scripture usually calls "angels" is a truth of faith.
the witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition.
Christ "with all his angels"
From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels.
When God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all God's angels worship him.'"
Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise: "Glory to God in the highest!"
They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been.
Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection.
They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his judgement.
The angels in the life of the Church
In the meantime, the whole life of the Church benefits from the mysterious and powerful help of angels.
From infancy to death human life is surrounded by their watchful care and intercession.
"Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life."
Already here on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of angels and men united in God.
Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and perfection.
For each one of the works of the "six days" it is said: "and God saw that it was good."
"By the very nature of creation, material being is endowed with its own stability, truth and excellence, its own order and laws."
Each of the various creatures, willed in its own being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom and goodness.
Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which would be in contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment.
The hierarchy of creatures is expressed by the order of the "six days", from the less perfect to the more perfect.
God loves all his creatures and takes care of each one, even the sparrow.
Nevertheless, Jesus said: "You are of more value than many sparrows", or again: "of how much more value is a man than a sheep!"
There is a solidarity among all creatures arising from the fact that all have the same Creator and are all ordered to his glory.
Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore for the worship and adoration of God.
Worship is inscribed in the order of creation.
As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take precedence over "the work of God", that is, solemn worship.
This indicates the right order of human concerns.
The sabbath is at the heart of Israel's law.
To keep the commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as expressed in his work of creation.
Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God without ceasing and who serve his saving plans for other creatures: "The angels work together for the benefit of us all" .
The angels surround Christ their Lord.
They serve him especially in the accomplishment of his saving mission to men.
The Church venerates the angels who help her on her earthly pilgrimage and protect every human being.
Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations which derive from the nature of things is a principle of wisdom and a foundation for morality.
"God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them."
Man occupies a unique place in creation: he is "in the image of God"; in his own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; he is created "male and female"; God established him in his friendship.
of all visible creatures only man is "able to know and love his creator".
He is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for its own sake", and he alone is called to share, by knowledge and love, in God's own life.
It was for this end that he was created, and this is the fundamental reason for his dignity:
What made you establish man in so great a dignity?
Certainly the incalculable love by which you have looked on your creature in yourself!
You are taken with love for her; for by love indeed you created her, by love you have given her a being capable of tasting your eternal Good.
God created everything for man, but man in turn was created to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him:
"In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man truly becomes clear."
"This law of human solidarity and charity", without excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures and peoples, assures us that all men are truly brethren.
The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and spiritual.
the biblical account expresses this reality in symbolic language when it affirms that "then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."
Man, whole and entire, is therefore willed by God.
In Sacred Scripture the term "soul" often refers to human life or the entire human person.
But "soul" also refers to the innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him, that by which he is most especially in God's image: "soul" signifies the spiritual principle in man.
The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God - it is not "produced" by the parents - and also that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final Resurrection.
Equality and difference willed by God
Man and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on the other, in their respective beings as man and woman.
"Being man" or "being woman" is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.
Man and woman are both with one and the same dignity "in the image of God".
In their "being-man" and "being-woman", they reflect the Creator's wisdom and goodness.
In no way is God in man's image.
He is neither man nor woman.
God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes.
But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband.
"Each for the other" - "A unity in two"
Man and woman were made "for each other" - not that God left them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion of persons, in which each can be "helpmate" to the other, for they are equal as persons and complementary as masculine and feminine.
In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming "one flesh", they can transmit human life: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."
By transmitting human life to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents co-operate in a unique way in the Creator's work.
By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life were confirmed.
As long as he remained in the divine intimacy, man would not have to suffer or die.
The inner harmony of the human person, the harmony between man and woman, and finally the harmony between the first couple and all creation, comprised the state called "original justice".
The "mastery" over the world that God offered man from the beginning was realized above all within man himself: mastery of self.
the first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole being because he was free from the triple concupiscence that subjugates him to the pleasures of the senses, covetousness for earthly goods, and self-assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason.
The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places him in the garden.
There he lives "to till it and keep it".
Work is not yet a burden, but rather the collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.
Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God's Son made man, the "image of the invisible God" , so that Christ shall be the first-born of a multitude of brothers and sisters .
"Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity" .
the doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is created immediately by God.
Revelation makes known to us the state of original holiness and justice of man and woman before sin: from their friendship with God flowed the happiness of their existence in paradise.
Original sin - an essential truth of the faith
With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also illuminated.
Although to some extent the People of God in the Old Testament had tried to understand the pathos of the human condition in the light of the history of the fall narrated in Genesis, they could not grasp this story's ultimate meaning, which is revealed only in the light of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
We must know Christ as the source of grace in order to know Adam as the source of sin.
the Spirit-Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ, came to "convict the world concerning sin", by revealing him who is its Redeemer.
How to read the account of the fall
The account of the fall in Genesis uses figurative language, but affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man.
Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first parents.
Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.
This "fall" consists in the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and irrevocably rejected God and his reign.
We find a reflection of that rebellion in the tempter's words to our first parents: "You will be like God."
The devil "has sinned from the beginning"; he is "a liar and the father of lies".
It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in the infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgivable.
"There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as there is no repentance for men after death."
Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus calls "a murderer from the beginning", who would even try to divert Jesus from the mission received from his Father.
"The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."
In its consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction that led man to disobey God.
The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite.
He is only a creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a creature.
He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign.
Although Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave injuries - of a spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical nature - to each man and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which with strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history.
It is a great mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but "we know that in everything God works for good with those who love him."
God created man in his image and established him in his friendship.
A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only in free submission to God.
the prohibition against eating "of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" spells this out: "for in the day that you eat of it, you shall die."
The "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man, being a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust.
Man is dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to the moral norms that govern the use of freedom.
Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command.
This is what man's first sin consisted of.
All subsequent sin would be disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness.
Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first disobedience.
Adam and Eve immediately lose the grace of original holiness.
They become afraid of the God of whom they have conceived a distorted image - that of a God jealous of his prerogatives.
The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks to original justice, is now destroyed: the control of the soul's spiritual faculties over the body is shattered; the union of man and woman becomes subject to tensions, their relations henceforth marked by lust and domination.
Harmony with creation is broken: visible creation has become alien and hostile to man.
Because of man, creation is now subject "to its bondage to decay".
Finally, the consequence explicitly foretold for this disobedience will come true: man will "return to the ground", for out of it he was taken.
Death makes its entrance into human history.
The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity
All men are implicated in Adam's sin, as St. Paul affirms: "By one man's disobedience many were made sinners": "sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned."
The Apostle contrasts the universality of sin and death with the universality of salvation in Christ.
"Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men."
Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the overwhelming misery which oppresses men and their inclination towards evil and death cannot be understood apart from their connection with Adam's sin and the fact that he has transmitted to us a sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is the "death of the soul".
Because of this certainty of faith, the Church baptizes for the remission of sins even tiny infants who have not committed personal sin.
Although it is proper to each individual, original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants.
It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence".
Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.
The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of redemption by Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation and activity in the world.
By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free.
Original sin entails "captivity under the power of him who thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the devil".
Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action and morals.
The consequences of original sin and of all men's personal sins put the world as a whole in the sinful condition aptly described in St. John's expression, "the sin of the world".
This expression can also refer to the negative influence exerted on people by communal situations and social structures that are the fruit of men's sins.
This dramatic situation of "the whole world which is in the power of the evil one" makes man's life a battle
After his fall, man was not abandoned by God.
On the contrary, God calls him and in a mysterious way heralds the coming victory over evil and his restoration from his fall.
This passage in Genesis is called the Protoevangelium : the first announcement of the Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle between the serpent and the Woman, and of the final victory of a descendant of hers.
The Christian tradition sees in this passage an announcement of the "New Adam" who, because he "became obedient unto death, even death on a cross", makes amends superabundantly for the disobedience, of Adam.
Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of the Church have seen the woman announced in the "Proto-evangelium" as Mary, the mother of Christ, the "new Eve".
Mary benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ's victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of original sin and by a special grace of God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly life.
Satan or the devil and the other demons are fallen angels who have freely refused to serve God and his plan.
Their choice against God is definitive.
They try to associate man in their revolt against God.
By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings.
As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin .
The victory that Christ won over sin has given us greater blessings than those which sin had taken from us: "where sin increased, grace abounded all the more" .
'But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.'
This is 'the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God': God has visited his people.
He has fulfilled the promise he made to Abraham and his descendants.
He acted far beyond all expectation - he has sent his own 'beloved Son'.
Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father, we believe in Jesus and confess: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'
On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter, Christ built his Church.
At the heart of catechesis: Christ
From this loving knowledge of Christ springs the desire to proclaim him, to "evangelize", and to lead others to the "yes" of faith in Jesus Christ.
But at the same time the need to know this faith better makes itself felt.
To this end, following the order of the Creed, Jesus' principal titles - "Christ", "Son of God", and "Lord" - will be presented.
the Creed next confesses the chief mysteries of his life - those of his Incarnation , Paschal mystery and glorification .
Jesus means in Hebrew: "God saves."
At the annunciation, the angel Gabriel gave him the name Jesus as his proper name, which expresses both his identity and his mission.
Since God alone can forgive sins, it is God who, in Jesus his eternal Son made man, "will save his people from their sins".
in Jesus, God recapitulates all of his history of salvation on behalf of men.
The name of the Saviour God was invoked only once in the year by the high priest in atonement for the sins of Israel, after he had sprinkled the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies with the sacrificial blood.
the mercy seat was the place of God's presence.
When St. Paul speaks of Jesus whom "God put forward as an expiation by his blood", he means that in Christ's humanity "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself."
The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer.
All liturgical prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord Jesus Christ".
the Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words "blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus."
the Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc, have died with the one word "Jesus" on their lips.
The word "Christ" comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Messiah, which means "anointed".
It became the name proper to Jesus only because he accomplished perfectly the divine mission that "Christ" signifies.
In effect, in Israel those consecrated to God for a mission that he gave were anointed in his name.
This was the case for kings, for priests and, in rare instances, for prophets.
This had to be the case all the more so for the Messiah whom God would send to inaugurate his kingdom definitively.
It was necessary that the Messiah be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord at once as king and priest, and also as prophet.
Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet and king.
To the shepherds, the angel announced the birth of Jesus as the Messiah promised to Israel: "To you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord."
From the beginning he was "the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world", conceived as "holy" in Mary's virginal womb.
God called Joseph to "take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit", so that Jesus, "who is called Christ", should be born of Joseph's spouse into the messianic lineage of David.
Jesus' messianic consecration reveals his divine mission, "for the name 'Christ' implies 'he who anointed', 'he who was anointed' and 'the very anointing with which he was anointed'.
the one who anointed is the Father, the one who was anointed is the Son, and he was anointed with the Spirit who is the anointing.'"
His eternal messianic consecration was revealed during the time of his earthly life at the moment of his baptism by John, when "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power", "that he might be revealed to Israel" as its Messiah.
His works and words will manifest him as "the Holy One of God".
Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messianic "Son of David", promised by God to Israel.
Jesus accepted his rightful title of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by some of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially political.
Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Messiah's divine sonship because Jesus had clearly allowed it to be so understood.
To his accusers' question before the Sanhedrin, "Are you the Son of God, then?"
Jesus answered, "You say that I am."
Well before this, Jesus referred to himself as "the Son" who knows the Father, as distinct from the "servants" God had earlier sent to his people; he is superior even to the angels.
He distinguished his sonship from that of his disciples by never saying "our Father", except to command them: "You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father'", and he emphasized this distinction, saying "my Father and your Father".
The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father designates Jesus his "beloved Son".
Jesus calls himself the "only Son of God", and by this title affirms his eternal pre-existence.
He asks for faith in "the name of the only Son of God".
In the centurion's exclamation before the crucified Christ, "Truly this man was the Son of God", that Christian confession is already heard.
Only in the Paschal mystery can the believer give the title "Son of God" its full meaning.
After his Resurrection, Jesus' divine sonship becomes manifest in the power of his glorified humanity.
He was "designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the dead".
The apostles can confess: "We have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the ineffable Hebrew name YHWH, by which God revealed himself to Moses, is rendered as Kyrios, "Lord".
From then on, "Lord" becomes the more usual name by which to indicate the divinity of Israel's God.
the New Testament uses this full sense of the title "Lord" both for the Father and - what is new - for Jesus, who is thereby recognized as God Himself.
Jesus ascribes this title to himself in a veiled way when he disputes with the Pharisees about the meaning of Psalm , but also in an explicit way when he addresses his apostles.
Throughout his public life, he demonstrated his divine sovereignty by works of power over nature, illnesses, demons, death and sin.
Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as "Lord".
This title testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach him for help and healing.
At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, "Lord" expresses the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.
In the encounter with the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration: "My Lord and my God!"
It thus takes on a connotation of love and affection that remains proper to the Christian tradition: "It is the Lord!"
By attributing to Jesus the divine title "Lord", the first confessions of the Church's faith affirm from the beginning that the power, honour and glory due to God the Father are due also to Jesus, because "he was in the form of God", and the Father manifested the sovereignty of Jesus by raising him from the dead and exalting him into his glory.
Christian prayer is characterized by the title "Lord", whether in the invitation to prayer , its conclusion or the exclamation full of trust and hope: Maranatha or Maranatha - "Amen Come Lord Jesus!"
The title "Lord" indicates divine sovereignty.
To confess or invoke Jesus as Lord is to believe in his divinity.
"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit'" .
Taking up St. John's expression, "The Word became flesh", The Church calls "Incarnation" the fact that the Son of God assumed a human nature in order to accomplish our salvation in it.
In a hymn cited by St. Paul, the Church sings the mystery of the Incarnation:
Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
and being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.
The Letter to the Hebrews refers to the same mystery:
Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.
Then I said, Lo, I have come to do your will, O God."
The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God and part man, nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused mixture of the divine and the human.
He became truly man while remaining truly God.
Jesus Christ is true God and true man.
During the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this truth of faith against the heresies that falsified it.
The first heresies denied not so much Christ's divinity as his true humanity .
From apostolic times the Christian faith has insisted on the true incarnation of God's Son "come in the flesh".
But already in the third century, the Church in a council at Antioch had to affirm against Paul of Samosata that Jesus Christ is Son of God by nature and not by adoption.
the first ecumenical council of Nicaea in confessed in its Creed that the Son of God is "begotten, not made, of the same substance as the Father", and condemned Arius, who had affirmed that the Son of God "came to be from things that were not" and that he was "from another substance" than that of the Father.
The Monophysites affirmed that the human nature had ceased to exist as such in Christ when the divine person of God's Son assumed it.
Faced with this heresy, the fourth ecumenical council, at Chalcedon in , confessed:
After the Council of Chalcedon, some made of Christ's human nature a kind of personal subject.
Against them, the fifth ecumenical council, at Constantinople in , confessed that "there is but one hypostasis or person, which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Trinity."
Thus everything in Christ's human nature is to be attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not only his miracles but also his sufferings and even his death: "He who was crucified in the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ, is true God, Lord of glory, and one of the Holy Trinity."
The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true God and true man.
He is truly the Son of God who, without ceasing to be God and Lord, became a man and our brother
Christ's soul and his human knowledge
Apollinarius of Laodicaea asserted that in Christ the divine Word had replaced the soul or spirit.
Against this error the Church confessed that the eternal Son also assumed a rational, human soul.
This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a true human knowledge.
As such, this knowledge could not in itself be unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of his existence in space and time.
This is why the Son of God could, when he became man, "increase in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man", and would even have to inquire for himself about what one in the human condition can learn only from experience.
This corresponded to the reality of his voluntary emptying of himself, taking "the form of a slave".
But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's Son expressed the divine life of his person.
"The human nature of God's Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God."
Such is first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made man has of his Father.
The Son in his human knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the secret thoughts of human hearts.
By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveal.
What he admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere declared himself not sent to reveal.
At the same time the Church has always acknowledged that in the body of Jesus "we see our God made visible and so are caught up in love of the God we cannot see."
The individual characteristics of Christ's body express the divine person of God's Son.
He has made the features of his human body his own, to the point that they can be venerated when portrayed in a holy image, for the believer "who venerates the icon is venerating in it the person of the one depicted".
The heart of the Incarnate Word
At the time appointed by God, the only Son of the Father, the eternal Word, that is, the Word and substantial Image of the Father, became incarnate; without losing his divine nature he has assumed human nature.
Jesus Christ possesses two natures, one divine and the other human, not confused, but united in the one person of God's Son.
Christ, being true God and true man, has a human intellect and will, perfectly attuned and subject to his divine intellect and divine will, which he has in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
The Incarnation is therefore the mystery of the wonderful union of the divine and human natures in the one person of the Word.
The Father's only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the Virgin Mary, is "Christ", that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, from the beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples.
Thus the whole life of Jesus Christ will make manifest "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power."
What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it believes about Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in turn its faith in Christ.
The Father of mercies willed that the Incarnation should be preceded by assent on the part of the predestined mother, so that just as a woman had a share in the coming of death, so also should a woman contribute to the coming of life.
Throughout the Old Covenant the mission of many holy women prepared for that of Mary.
At the very beginning there was Eve; despite her disobedience, she receives the promise of a posterity that will be victorious over the evil one, as well as the promise that she will be the mother of all the living.
By virtue of this promise, Sarah conceives a son in spite of her old age.
Against all human expectation God chooses those who were considered powerless and weak to show forth his faithfulness to his promises: Hannah, the mother of Samuel; Deborah; Ruth; Judith and Esther; and many other women.
Mary "stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord, who confidently hope for and receive salvation from him.
After a long period of waiting the times are fulfilled in her, the exalted Daughter of Sion, and the new plan of salvation is established."
To become the mother of the Saviour, Mary "was enriched by God with gifts appropriate to such a role."
The angel Gabriel at the moment of the annunciation salutes her as "full of grace".
In fact, in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly borne by God's grace.
The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God "the All-Holy" , and celebrate her as "free from any stain of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature".
By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life long.
At the announcement that she would give birth to "the Son of the Most High" without knowing man, by the power of the Holy Spirit, Mary responded with the obedience of faith, certain that "with God nothing will be impossible": "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word."
Thus, giving her consent to God's word, Mary becomes the mother of Jesus.
Espousing the divine will for salvation wholeheartedly, without a single sin to restrain her, she gave herself entirely to the person and to the work of her Son; she did so in order to serve the mystery of redemption with him and dependent on him, by God's grace:
People are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark's Gospel and the New Testament Epistles about Jesus' virginal conception.
Some might wonder if we were merely dealing with legends or theological constructs not claiming to be history.
To this we must respond: Faith in the virginal conception of Jesus met with the lively opposition, mockery or incomprehension of non-believers, Jews and pagans alike; so it could hardly have been motivated by pagan mythology or by some adaptation to the ideas of the age.
the meaning of this event is accessible only to faith, which understands in it the "connection of these mysteries with one another" in the totality of Christ's mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover.
St. Ignatius of Antioch already bears witness to this connection: "Mary's virginity and giving birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the notice of the prince of this world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were accomplished in God's silence."
The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church to confess Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the Son of God made man.
In fact, Christ's birth "did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it."
and so the liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the "Ever-virgin".
Mary's virginal motherhood in God's plan
The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of Revelation the mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan wanted his Son to be born of a virgin.
These reasons touch both on the person of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the welcome Mary gave that mission on behalf of all men.
Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: "The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven."
From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for God "gives him the Spirit without measure."
From "his fullness" as the head of redeemed humanity "we have all received, grace upon grace."
Mary is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith "unadulterated by any doubt", and of her undivided gift of herself to God's will.
It is her faith that enables her to become the mother of the Saviour: "Mary is more blessed because she embraces faith in Christ than because she conceives the flesh of Christ."
Mary is truly "Mother of God" since she is the mother of the eternal Son of God made man, who is God himself.
The Virgin Mary "co-operated through free faith and obedience in human salvation" .
She uttered her yes "in the name of all human nature" .
By her obedience she became the new Eve, mother of the living.
Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries of the Incarnation and Paschal mystery .
It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' hidden or public life, but the articles of faith concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole of his earthly life.
"All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven", is to be seen in the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter.
Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not figure in the Gospels.
Almost nothing is said about his hidden life at Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not recounted.
What is written in the Gospels was set down there "so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name."
The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to have the faith174 and wanted to share it with others.
Having known in faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see the traces of his mystery in all his earthly life.
From the swaddling clothes of his birth to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, everything in Jesus' life was a sign of his mystery.
His deeds, miracles and words all revealed that "in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."
His humanity appeared as "sacrament", that is, the sign and instrument, of his divinity and of the salvation he brings: what was visible in his earthly life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine sonship and redemptive mission
Characteristics common to Jesus' mysteries
Christ's whole life is a mystery of redemption.
Redemption comes to us above all through the blood of his cross, but this mystery is at work throughout Christ's entire life: -already in his Incarnation through which by becoming poor he enriches us with his poverty; - in his hidden life which by his submission atones for our disobedience; - in his word which purifies its hearers;- in his healings and exorcisms by which "he took our infirmities and bore our diseases"; - and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us.
When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he recapitulated in himself the long history of mankind and procured for us a "short cut" to salvation, so that what we had lost in Adam, that is, being in the image and likeness of God, we might recover in Christ Jesus.
For this reason Christ experienced all the stages of life, thereby giving communion with God to all men.
Our communion in the mysteries of Jesus
All Christ's riches "are for every individual and are everybody's property."
Christ did not live his life for himself but for us, from his Incarnation "for us men and for our salvation" to his death "for our sins" and Resurrection "for our justification".
He is still "our advocate with the Father", who "always lives to make intercession" for us.
He remains ever "in the presence of God on our behalf, bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for us."
Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he lives it in us.
"By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain way united himself with each man."
We are called only to become one with him, for he enables us as the members of his Body to share in what he lived for us in his flesh as our model:
The coming of God's Son to earth is an event of such immensity that God willed to prepare for it over centuries.
He makes everything converge on Christ: all the rituals and sacrifices, figures and symbols of the "First Covenant".
He announces him through the mouths of the prophets who succeeded one another in Israel.
Moreover, he awakens in the hearts of the pagans a dim expectation of this coming.
St. John the Baptist is the Lord's immediate precursor or forerunner, sent to prepare his way.
"Prophet of the Most High", John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last.
He inaugurates the Gospel, already from his mother's womb welcomes the coming of Christ, and rejoices in being "the friend of the bridegroom", whom he points out as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".
Going before Jesus "in the spirit and power of Elijah", John bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of conversion, and through his martyrdom.
When the Church celebrates the liturgy of Advent each year, she makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in the long preparation for the Saviour's first coming, the faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming.
By celebrating the precursor's birth and martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his desire: "He must increase, but I must decrease."
Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.
Simple shepherds were the first witnesses to this event.
In this poverty heaven's glory was made manifest.
The Church never tires of singing the glory of this night:
The Virgin today brings into the world the Eternal
and the earth offers a cave to the Inaccessible.
The angels and shepherds praise him
and the magi advance with the star,
Little Child, God eternal!
The mysteries of Jesus' infancy
The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of Israel, Son of God and Saviour of the world.
the great feast of Epiphany celebrates the adoration of Jesus by the wise men from the East, together with his baptism in the Jordan and the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee.
In the magi, representatives of the neighbouring pagan religions, the Gospel sees the first-fruits of the nations, who welcome the good news of salvation through the Incarnation.
the magi's coming to Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king of the Jews shows that they seek in Israel, in the messianic light of the star of David, the one who will be king of the nations.
Their coming means that pagans can discover Jesus and worship him as Son of God and Saviour of the world only by turning towards the Jews and receiving from them the messianic promise as contained in the Old Testament.
The Epiphany shows that "the full number of the nations" now takes its "place in the family of the patriarchs", and acquires Israelitica dignitas215 .
The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the firstborn Son who belongs to the Lord.
With Simeon and Anna, all Israel awaits its encounter with the Saviour - the name given to this event in the Byzantine tradition.
Jesus is recognized as the long-expected Messiah, the "light to the nations" and the "glory of Israel", but also "a sign that is spoken against".
the sword of sorrow predicted for Mary announces Christ's perfect and unique oblation on the cross that will impart the salvation God had "prepared in the presence of all peoples".
The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents217 make manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: "He came to his own home, and his own people received him not."
Christ's whole life was lived under the sign of persecution.
His own share it with him.
Jesus' departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the definitive liberator of God's people.
The mysteries of Jesus' hidden life
The hidden life at Nazareth allows everyone to enter into fellowship with Jesus by the most ordinary events of daily life:
Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection.
the Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's beloved son in the Son and "walk in newness of life":
Everything that happened to Christ lets us know that, after the bath of water, the Holy Spirit swoops down upon us from high heaven and that, adopted by the Father's voice, we become sons of God.
Jesus' temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God is Messiah, contrary to the way Satan proposes to him and the way men wish to attribute to him.
This is why Christ vanquished the Tempter for us: "For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sinning."
By the solemn forty days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of Jesus in the desert.
"The kingdom of God is at hand"
Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the "family of God".
By his word, through signs that manifest the reign of God, and by sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people to come together around him.
But above all in the great Paschal mystery - his death on the cross and his Resurrection - he would accomplish the coming of his kingdom.
"and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."
Into this union with Christ all men are called.
The proclamation of the kingdom of God
Everyone is called to enter the kingdom.
First announced to the children of Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of all nations.
To enter it, one must first accept Jesus' word:
The signs of the kingdom of God
Jesus accompanies his words with many "mighty works and wonders and signs", which manifest that the kingdom is present in him and attest that he was the promised Messiah.
The coming of God's kingdom means the defeat of Satan's: "If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Jesus' exorcisms free some individuals from the domination of demons.
They anticipate Jesus' great victory over "the ruler of this world".
The kingdom of God will be definitively established through Christ's cross: "God reigned from the wood."
From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain men, twelve in number, to be with him and to participate in his mission.
He gives the Twelve a share in his authority and 'sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal."
They remain associated for ever with Christ's kingdom, for through them he directs the Church:
As my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
The "power of the keys" designates authority to govern the house of God, which is the Church.
Jesus, the Good Shepherd, confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection: "Feed my sheep."
The power to "bind and loose" connotes the authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church.
Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through the ministry of the apostles289 and in particular through the ministry of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted the keys of the kingdom.
A foretaste of the kingdom: the Transfiguration
For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter's confession.
He also reveals that he will have to go by the way of the cross at Jerusalem in order to "enter into his glory".
Moses and Elijah had seen God's glory on the Mountain; the Law and the Prophets had announced the Messiah's sufferings.
Christ's Passion is the will of the Father: the Son acts as God's servant; The cloud indicates the presence of the Holy Spirit.
"The whole Trinity appeared: the Father in the voice; the Son in the man; the Spirit in the shining cloud."
Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain with Christ on the mountain.
It has been reserved for you, Peter, but for after death.
For now, Jesus says: "Go down to toil on earth, to serve on earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth.
Life goes down to be killed; Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be exhausted on his journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and you refuse to suffer?"
Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem
Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to death in Jerusalem.
Nevertheless he persists in calling Jerusalem to gather around him: "How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!"
When Jerusalem comes into view he weeps over her and expresses once again his heart's desire: "Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace!
But now they are hid from your eyes."
Jesus' messianic entrance into Jerusalem
Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom that the King-Messiah was going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death and Resurrection.
It is with the celebration of that entry on Palm Sunday that the Church's liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week.
"The whole of Christ's life was a continual teaching: his silences, his miracles, his gestures, his prayer, his love for people, his special affection for the little and the poor, his acceptance of the total sacrifice on the Cross for the redemption of the world, and his Resurrection are the actualization of his word and the fulfilment of Revelation" John Paul II, CT 9).
Christ's disciples are to conform themselves to him until he is formed in them .
"For this reason we, who have been made like to him, who have died with him and risen with him, are taken up into the mysteries of his life, until we reign together with him" .
No one, whether shepherd or wise man, can approach God here below except by kneeling before the manger at Bethlehem and adoring him hidden in the weakness of a new-born child.
By his obedience to Mary and Joseph, as well as by his humble work during the long years in Nazareth, Jesus gives us the example of holiness in the daily life of family and work.
From the beginning of his public life, at his baptism, Jesus is the "Servant", wholly consecrated to the redemptive work that he will accomplish by the "baptism" of his Passion.
The temptation in the desert shows Jesus, the humble Messiah, who triumphs over Satan by his total adherence to the plan of salvation willed by the Father.
The kingdom of heaven was inaugurated on earth by Christ.
"This kingdom shone out before men in the word, in the works and in the presence of Christ" .
the Church is the seed and beginning of this kingdom.
Its keys are entrusted to Peter.
Christ's Transfiguration aims at strengthening the apostles' faith in anticipation of his Passion: the ascent on to the "high mountain" prepares for the ascent to Calvary.
Christ, Head of the Church, manifests what his Body contains and radiates in the sacraments: "the hope of glory" .
Jesus went up to Jerusalem voluntarily, knowing well that there he would die a violent death because of the opposition of sinners .
The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection stands at the centre of the Good News that the apostles, and the Church following them, are to proclaim to the world.
God's saving plan was accomplished "once for all" by the redemptive death of his Son Jesus Christ.
The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all the Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"
Jesus' sufferings took their historical, concrete form from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes", who handed "him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified".
Faith can therefore try to examine the circumstances of Jesus' death, faithfully handed on by the Gospels316 and illuminated by other historical sources, the better to understand the meaning of the Redemption.
From the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, certain Pharisees and partisans of Herod together with priests and scribes agreed together to destroy him.
Because of certain acts of his expelling demons, forgiving sins, healing on the sabbath day, his novel interpretation of the precepts of the Law regarding purity, and his familiarity with tax collectors and public sinners318--some ill-intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic possession.
He is accused of blasphemy and false prophecy, religious crimes which the Law punished with death by stoning.
In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against essential institutions of the Chosen People:
Submission to the whole of the Law in its written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in the interpretation of oral tradition;
The centrality of the Temple at Jerusalem as the holy place where God's presence dwells in a special way;
Faith in the one God whose glory no man can share.
Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, was to fulfil the Law by keeping it in its all embracing detail - according to his own words, down to "the least of these commandments".
He is in fact the only one who could keep it perfectly.
On their own admission the Jews were never able to observe the Law in its entirety without violating the least of its precepts.
This is why every year on the Day of Atonement the children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their transgressions of the Law.
the Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, and St. James recalls, "Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it."
This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter but in spirit was dear to the Pharisees.
By giving Israel this principle they had led many Jews of Jesus' time to an extreme religious zeal.
This zeal, were it not to lapse into "hypocritical" casuistry, could only prepare the People for the unprecedented intervention of God through the perfect fulfilment of the Law by the only Righteous One in place of all sinners.
Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple in Jerusalem.
It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary presented him forty days after his birth.
At the age of twelve he decided to remain in the Temple to remind his parents that he must be about his Father's business.
He went there each year during his hidden life at least for Passover.
His public ministry itself was patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish feasts.
On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming destruction of this splendid building, of which there would not remain "one stone upon another".
By doing so, he announced a sign of the last days, which were to begin with his own Passover.
But this prophecy would be distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his interrogation at the high priest's house, and would be thrown back at him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross.
If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of opposition to Jesus by Israel's religious authorities, his role in the redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true stumbling-block for them.
Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and sinners as familiarly as with themselves.
Against those among them "who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others", Jesus affirmed: "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
He went further by proclaiming before the Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who pretend not to need salvation are blind to themselves.
Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful conduct toward sinners with God's own attitude toward them.
He went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was admitting them to the messianic banquet.
But it was most especially by forgiving sins that Jesus placed the religious authorities of Israel on the horns of a dilemma.
Were they not entitled to demand in consternation, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
By forgiving sins Jesus either is blaspheming as a man who made himself God's equal, or is speaking the truth and his person really does make present and reveal God's name.
Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it with such perfection that he revealed its ultimate meaning and redeemed the transgressions against it .
Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it for the Jewish feasts of pilgrimage, and with a jealous love he loved this dwelling of God among men.
the Temple prefigures his own mystery.
When he announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution and of the entry into a new age in the history of salvation, when his Body would be the definitive Temple.
Jesus performed acts, such as pardoning sins, that manifested him to be the Saviour God himself .
Certain Jews, who did not recognize God made man , saw in him only a man who made himself God , and judged him as a blasphemer.
The religious authorities in Jerusalem were not unanimous about what stance to take towards Jesus.
The Pharisees threatened to excommunicate his followers.
To those who feared that "everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation", the high priest Caiaphas replied by prophesying: "It is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."
The Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer but having lost the right to put anyone to death, hands him over to the Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the same category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.
The chief priests also threatened Pilate politically so that he would condemn Jesus to death.
Jews are not collectively responsible for Jesus' death
All sinners were the authors of Christ's Passion
In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer endured."
Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ himself, The Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews alone:
Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified him and crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.
"Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God"
"He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures"
"For our sake God made him to be sin"
Jesus did not experience reprobation as if he himself had sinned.
But in the redeeming love that always united him to the Father, he assumed us in the state of our waywardness of sin, to the point that he could say in our name from the cross: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Having thus established him in solidarity with us sinners, God "did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all", so that we might be "reconciled to God by the death of his Son".
God takes the initiative of universal redeeming love
By giving up his own Son for our sins, God manifests that his plan for us is one of benevolent love, prior to any merit on our part: "In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins."
God "shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."
Christ's whole life is an offering to the Father
"The Lamb who takes away the sin of the world"
After agreeing to baptize him along with the sinners, John the Baptist looked at Jesus and pointed him out as the "Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".
By doing so, he reveals that Jesus is at the same time the suffering Servant who silently allows himself to be led to the slaughter and who bears the sin of the multitudes, and also the Paschal Lamb, the symbol of Israel's redemption at the first Passover.
Christ's whole life expresses his mission: "to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus freely embraced the Father's redeeming love
By embracing in his human heart the Father's love for men, Jesus "loved them to the end", for "greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
In suffering and death his humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love which desires the salvation of men.
Indeed, out of love for his Father and for men, whom the Father wants to save, Jesus freely accepted his Passion and death: "No one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord."
Hence the sovereign freedom of God's Son as he went out to his death.
At the Last Supper Jesus anticipated the free offering of his life
Jesus gave the supreme expression of his free offering of himself at the meal shared with the twelve Apostles "on the night he was betrayed".
On the eve of his Passion, while still free, Jesus transformed this Last Supper with the apostles into the memorial of his voluntary offering to the Father for the salvation of men: "This is my body which is given for you."
"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."
The Eucharist that Christ institutes at that moment will be the memorial of his sacrifice.
Jesus includes the apostles in his own offering and bids them perpetuate it.
By doing so, the Lord institutes his apostles as priests of the New Covenant: "For their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth."
Christ's death is the unique and definitive sacrifice
Christ's death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes the definitive redemption of men, through "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", and the sacrifice of the New Covenant, which restores man to communion with God by reconciling him to God through the "blood of the covenant, which was poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins".
This sacrifice of Christ is unique; it completes and surpasses all other sacrifices.
First, it is a gift from God the Father himself, for the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to reconcile us with himself.
At the same time it is the offering of the Son of God made man, who in freedom and love offered his life to his Father through the Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience.
Jesus substitutes his obedience for our disobedience
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous."
By his obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the suffering Servant, who "makes himself an offering for sin", when "he bore the sin of many", and who "shall make many to be accounted righteous", for "he shall bear their iniquities".
Jesus atoned for our faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father.
Jesus consummates his sacrifice on the cross
It is love "to the end" that confers on Christ's sacrifice its value as redemption and reparation, as atonement and satisfaction.
He knew and loved us all when he offered his life.
Now "the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died."
No man, not even the holiest, was ever able to take on himself the sins of all men and offer himself as a sacrifice for all.
the existence in Christ of the divine person of the Son, who at once surpasses and embraces all human persons, and constitutes himself as the Head of all mankind, makes possible his redemptive sacrifice for all.
The Council of Trent emphasizes the unique character of Christ's sacrifice as "the source of eternal salvation" and teaches that "his most holy Passion on the wood of the cross merited justification for us."
and the Church venerates his cross as she sings: "Hail, O Cross, our only hope."
Our participation in Christ's sacrifice
The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the "one mediator between God and men".
But because in his incarnate divine person he has in some way united himself to every man, "the possibility of being made partners, in a way known to God, in the paschal mystery" is offered to all men.
He calls his disciples to "take up their cross and follow ", for "Christ also suffered for , leaving an example so that should follow in his steps."
In fact Jesus desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be its first beneficiaries.
This is achieved supremely in the case of his mother, who was associated more intimately than any other person in the mystery of his redemptive suffering.
Apart from the cross there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven.
"Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures" .
Jesus freely offered himself for our salvation.
Beforehand, during the Last Supper, he both symbolized this offering and made it really present: "This is my body which is given for you" .
The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he came "to give his life as a ransom for many" , that is, he "loved his own to the end" , so that they might be "ransomed from the futile ways inherited from their fathers" .
By his loving obedience to the Father, "unto death, even death on a cross" , Jesus fulfils the atoning mission of the suffering Servant, who will "make many righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities" .
"By the grace of God" Jesus tasted death "for every one".
In his plan of salvation, God ordained that his Son should not only "die for our sins" but should also "taste death", experience the condition of death, the separation of his soul from his body, between the time he expired on the cross and the time he was raised from the dead.
the state of the dead Christ is the mystery of the tomb and the descent into hell.
It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the tomb, reveals God's great sabbath rest462 after the fulfilment463 of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe.
Christ in the tomb in his body
Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today.
the same person of the "Living One" can say, "I died, and behold I am alive for evermore":
God the Son did not impede death from separating his soul from his body according to the necessary order of nature, but has reunited them to one another in the Resurrection, so that he himself might be, in his person, the meeting point for death and life, by arresting in himself the decomposition of nature produced by death and so becoming the source of reunion for the separated parts.
Since the "Author of life" who was killed467 is the same "living one who has risen", The divine person of the Son of God necessarily continued to possess his human soul and body, separated from each other by death:
By the fact that at Chnst's death his soul was separated from his flesh, his one person is not itself divided into two persons; for the human body and soul of Christ have existed in the same way from the beginning of his earthly existence, in the divine person of the Word; and in death, although separated from each other, both remained with one and the same person of the Word.
