The environmental impact of meat production varies because of the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world.
All agricultural practices have been found to have a variety of effects on the environment.
Some of the environmental effects that have been associated with meat production are pollution through fossil fuel usage, animal methane, effluent waste, and water and land consumption.
Meat is obtained through a variety of methods, including organic farming, free range farming, intensive livestock production, subsistence agriculture, hunting, and fishing.
Meat is considered one of the prime factors contributing to the current sixth mass extinction.
The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis, with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact.
The 2006 report Livestock’s Long Shadow, released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, states that “the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole.
Globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity, and in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution.
” (In this and much other FAO usage, but not always elsewhere, poultry are included as “livestock”. ) 
A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture’s global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Some fraction of these effects is assignable to non-meat components of the livestock sector such as the wool, egg and dairy industries, and to the livestock used for tillage.
Livestock have been estimated to provide power for tillage of as much as half of the world’s cropland.
A July 2018 study in Science asserts that meat consumption will increase as the result of human population growth and rising individual incomes, which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce biodiversity.
On August 8, 2019, the IPCC released a summary of the 2019 special report which asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
 According to a 2018 study in the journal Nature, a significant reduction in meat consumption will be “essential” to mitigate climate change, especially as the human population increases by a projected 2.3 billion by the middle of the century.
In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for, among other things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat.
A similar shift to meat-free diets appears also as the only safe option to feed a growing population without further deforestation, and for different yields scenarios.
Changes in demand for meat may change the environmental impact of meat production by influencing how much meat is produced.
It has been estimated that global meat consumption may double from 2000 to 2050, mostly as a consequence of increasing world population, but also partly because of increased per capita meat consumption (with much of the per capita consumption increase occurring in the developing world).
Global production and consumption of poultry meat have recently been growing at more than 5 percent annually.
According to an article written by Dave Roos “industrialized Western nations average more than 220 pounds of meat per person per year, while the poorest African nations average less than 22 pounds per person.” 
Trends vary among livestock sectors.
For example, global per capita consumption of pork has increased recently (almost entirely due to changes in consumption within China), while global per capita consumption of ruminant meats has been declining.
In comparison with grazing, intensive livestock production requires large quantities of harvested feed, this overproduction of feed can also hold negative effects.
The growing of cereals for feed in turn requires substantial areas of land.
It takes seven pounds of feed to produce a pound of beef (live weight), more than three pounds for a pound of pork, and less than two pounds for a pound of chicken.
Assumptions about feed quality are implicit in such generalizations.
For example, production of a pound of beef cattle live weight may require between 4 and 5 pounds of feed high in protein and metabolizable energy content, or more than 20 pounds of feed of much lower quality.
About 85 percent of the world’s soybean crop is processed into meal and vegetable oil, and virtually all of that meal is used in animal feed.
Approximately six percent of soybeans are used directly as human food, mostly in Asia.
 In the contiguous United States, 127.4 million acres of crops are grown for animal consumption, compared to the 77.3 million acres of crops grown for human consumption.
Where grain is fed, less feed is required for meat production.
This is due not only to the higher concentration of metabolizable energy in grain than in roughages, but also to the higher ratio of net energy of gain to net energy of maintenance where metabolizable energy intake is higher.
Free-range animal production requires land for grazing, which in some places has led to land use change.
According to FAO, “Ranching-induced deforestation is one of the main causes of loss of some unique plant and animal species in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America as well as carbon release in the atmosphere.” 
Raising animals for human consumption accounts for approximately 40% of the total amount of agricultural output in industrialized countries.
Grazing occupies 26% of the earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface, and feed crop production uses about one third of all arable land.
More than one-third of U.S. land is used for pasture, making it the largest land-use type in the contiguous United States.
Land quality decline is sometimes associated with overgrazing, as these animals are removing much needed nutrients from the soil without the land having time to recover.
Rangeland health classification reflects soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity.
By the end of 2002, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had evaluated rangeland health on 7,437 grazing allotments (i.e., 35 percent of its grazing allotments or 36 percent of the land area contained in its grazing allotments) and found that 16 percent of these failed to meet rangeland health standards due to existing grazing practices or levels of grazing use.
This led the BLM to infer that a similar percentage would be obtained when such evaluations were completed.
Soil erosion associated with overgrazing is an important issue in many dry regions of the world.
On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops.
Sheet and rill erosion is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 95.1 percent, and wind erosion is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 99.4 percent of US pastureland inventoried by the US Natural Resources Conservation Service.
Environmental effects of grazing can be positive or negative, depending on the quality of management, and grazing can have different effects on different soils and different plant communities.
Grazing can sometimes reduce, and other times increase, biodiversity of grassland ecosystems.
A study comparing virgin grasslands under some grazed and nongrazed management systems in the US indicated somewhat lower soil organic carbon but higher soil nitrogen content with grazing.
In contrast, at the High Plains Grasslands Research Station in Wyoming, the top 30 cm of soil contained more organic carbon as well as more nitrogen on grazed pastures than on grasslands where livestock were excluded.
Similarly, on previously eroded soil in the Piedmont region of the US, pasture establishment with well-managed grazing of livestock resulted in high rates of both carbon and nitrogen sequestration relative to results obtained where grass was grown without grazing.
Such increases in carbon and nitrogen sequestration can help mitigate greenhouse gas emission effects.
In some cases, ecosystem productivity may be increased due to grazing effects on nutrient cycling.
The livestock sector is also the primary driver of deforestation in the Amazon, with around 80% of all converted land being used to rear cattle.
91% of land deforested since 1970 has been converted to cattle ranching.
Almost one-third of the water used in the western United States goes to crops that feed cattle.
This is despite the claim that withdrawn surface water and groundwater used for crop irrigation in the US exceeds that for livestock by about a ratio of 60:1.
This excessive use of river water distresses ecosystems and communities, and drives scores of species of fish closer to extinction during times of drought.
Irrigation accounts for about 37 percent of US withdrawn freshwater use, and groundwater provides about 42 percent of US irrigation water.
Irrigation water applied in production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent of withdrawn freshwater use in the United States.
Groundwater depletion is a concern in some areas because of sustainability issues (and in some cases, land subsidence and/or saltwater intrusion).
A particularly important North American example where depletion is occurring involves the High Plains (Ogallala) Aquifer, which underlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of eight states, and supplies 30 percent of the groundwater withdrawn for irrigation in the US.
Some irrigated livestock feed production is not hydrologically sustainable in the long run because of aquifer depletion.
Rainfed agriculture, which cannot deplete its water source, produces much of the livestock feed in North America.
Corn (maize) is of particular interest, accounting for about 91.8 percent of the grain fed to US livestock and poultry in 2010.
About 14 percent of US corn-for grain land is irrigated, accounting for about 17 percent of US corn-for-grain production, and about 13 percent of US irrigation water use, but only about 40 percent of US corn grain is fed to US livestock and poultry.
In the Western United States, many stream and riparian habitats have been negatively affected by livestock grazing. This has resulted in increased phosphates, nitrates, decreased dissolved oxygen, increased temperature, turbidity, and eutrophication events, and reduced species diversity.
Livestock management options for riparian protection include salt and mineral placement, limiting seasonal access, use of alternative water sources, provision of “hardened” stream crossings, herding, and fencing.
In the Eastern United States, a 1997 study found that waste release from pork farms have also been shown to cause large-scale eutrophication of bodies of water, including the Mississippi River and Atlantic Ocean (Palmquist, et al. , 1997).
In North Carolina, where the study was done, measures have since been taken to reduce the risk of accidental discharges from manure lagoons; also, since then there is evidence of improved environmental management in US hog production.
Implementation of manure and wastewater management planning can help assure low risk of problematic discharge into aquatic systems.
Overfishing has stripped many fisheries around the world of their stocks.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing.
Significant overfishing has been observed in pre-industrial times.
In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from the earliest days of European colonisation of the Americas has been well documented.
The fraction of fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a decreasing trend, from 90% in 1974 to 66.9% in 2015.
In contrast, the percentage of stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels increased from 10% in 1974 to 33.1% in 2015, with the largest increases in the late-1970s and 1980s.
In 2015, maximally sustainably fished stocks (formerly termed fully fished stocks) accounted for 59.9% and underfished stocks for 7% of the total assessed stocks.
While the proportion of underfished stocks decreased continuously from 1974 to 2015, the maximally sustainably fished stocks decreased from 1974 to 1989, and then increased to 59.9% in 2015.
In 2015, among the 16 major statistical areas, the Mediterranean and Black Sea had the highest percentage (62.2%) of unsustainable stocks, closely followed by the Southeast Pacific 61.5% and Southwest Atlantic 58.8%.
In contrast, the Eastern Central Pacific, Northeast Pacific (Area 67), Northwest Pacific (Area 61), Western Central Pacific and Southwest Pacific had the lowest proportion (13 to 17%) of fish stocks at biologically unsustainable levels.
Examples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea.
In these locations, overfishing has not only proved disastrous to fish stocks, but also to the fishing communities relying on the harvest.
Like other extractive industries such as forestry and hunting, fisheries are susceptible to economic interaction between ownership or stewardship and sustainability, otherwise known as the tragedy of the commons.
The Peruvian coastal anchovy fisheries crashed in the 1970s after overfishing and an El Niño season largely depleted anchovies from its waters.
Anchovies were a major natural resource in Peru; indeed, 1971 alone yielded 10.2 million metric tons of anchovies.
However, the following five years saw the Peruvian fleet’s catch amount to only about four million tons.
This was a major loss to Peru’s economy.
The collapse of the cod fishery off Newfoundland, and the 1992 decision by Canada to impose an indefinite moratorium on the Grand Banks, is a dramatic example of the consequences of overfishing.
The sole fisheries in the Irish Sea, the west English Channel, and other locations have become overfished to the point of virtual collapse, according to the UK government’s official Biodiversity Action Plan.
The United Kingdom has created elements in this plan to attempt to restore the fishery, but the expanding global human population and the expanding demand for fish has reached a point where demand for food threatens the stability of these fisheries, if not the species’ survival.
Many deep sea fish are at risk, such as orange roughy and sablefish.
The deep sea is almost completely dark, near freezing, and has little food.
Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many do not reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years.
A fillet of orange roughy at the store is probably at least 50 years old.
Most deep sea fish are in international waters, where there are no legal protections.
Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate for food.
Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.
According to a 2008 UN report, the world’s fishing fleets are losing US$50 billion each year due to depleted stocks and poor fisheries management.
The report, produced jointly by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), asserts that half the world’s fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch.
In addition, the biomass of global fish stocks have been allowed to run down to the point where it is no longer possible to catch the amount of fish that could be caught.
Increased incidence of schistosomiasis in Africa has been linked to declines of fish species that eat the snails carrying the disease-causing parasites.
Massive growth of jellyfish populations threaten fish stocks, as they compete with fish for food, eat fish eggs, and poison or swarm fish, and can survive in oxygen depleted environments where fish cannot; they wreak massive havoc on commercial fisheries.
Overfishing eliminates a major jellyfish competitor and predator, exacerbating the jellyfish population explosion.
Both climate change and a restructuring of the ecosystem have been found to be major roles in an increase in jellyfish population in the Irish Sea in the 1990s.
According to the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, overfishing is a primary driver of mass extinction in the world’s oceans.
Blue walleye became extinct in the Great Lakes in the 1980s.
Until the middle of the 20th century, the walleye was a commercially valuable fish, with about a half million tonnes being landed in the period from about 1880 to the late-1950s, when the populations collapsed, apparently through a combination of overfishing, anthropogenic eutrophication, and competition with introduced rainbow smelt.
The World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London jointly issued their “Living Blue Planet Report” on 16 September 2015 which states that there was a dramatic fall of 74% in worldwide stocks of the important scombridae fish such as mackerel, tuna and bonitos between 1970 and 2010, and the global overall “population sizes of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish fell by half on average in just 40 years.” 
Overfishing of the critically endangered Pacific bluefin tuna has resulted in the few still caught selling for astronomical prices.
In January 2019, a 278 kilogram (612 pound) tuna sold for 333.6 million yen, or over US$3 million, US$4,900 per pound.
Fishers, driven by the fish’s high value, use extraordinary techniques to catch them, leaving the population on the verge of collapse.
Eating meat has a hefty impact on the environment from fueling climate change to polluting landscapes and waterways.
Recycling or taking the bus rather than driving to work has its place, but scientists are increasingly pointing to a deeper lifestyle change that would be the single biggest way to help the planet: eating far less meat.
A swathe of research released over the past year has laid bare the hefty impact that eating meat, especially beef and pork, has upon the environment by fueling climate change and polluting landscapes and waterways.
Industrialized agriculture and the onset of the worst species extinction crisis since the demise of the dinosaurs means that livestock and humans now make up 96% of all mammals.
But despite consuming the vast majority of farmland, meat and dairy accounts for just 18% of all food calories and around a third of protein.
The mighty hoofprint of farmed meat isn’t just inefficient.
Deforestation to make way for livestock, along with methane emissions from cows and fertilizer use, creates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all the world’s cars, trucks and airplanes.
Meat rearing practices risk mass extinctions of other animals, as well as spawn significant pollution of streams, rivers and, ultimately, the ocean.
In October, scientists warned that huge reductions in meat eating are required if the world is to stave off dangerous climate change, with beef consumption in western countries needing to drop by 90%, replaced by five times more beans and pulses.
Consumption of pork, milk and eggs will also need to decline sharply, all as the world’s population balloons by an extra 2 billion people by 2050.
Researchers said there will need to be a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet to help keep the global temperature increase from breaching a 2C limit agreed by governments.
A host of measures have been suggested in order to achieve this, ranging from a tax on red meat to feeding seaweed to cows to reduce methane escaping in their burps.
Some advocates have promoted eating insects instead of steaks and pork chops.
A more likely avenue may be the advance of vegetarianism via lab grown meats and the popularity of vegan substitutes such as the Impossible burger, which even ‘bleeds’.
Whichever way change is achieved, there’s hope that 2019 will be a key year in the overhaul of a broken global food system.
The Amazon rainforest has been facing severe deforestation problems for several decades — it has lost about a fifth of its forest in the past three.
While there are many causes, one of the main causes is cattle ranching, particularly in Brazil.
Trees are cut and the land is converted into a pasture for cattle grazing.
According to one report, an estimated 70 percent of deforestation in the Amazon basin can be attributed to cattle ranching.
Using these numbers, cattle ranching in the Amazon has resulted in the loss of an area larger than the state of Washington.
Brazil is the world’s largest exporter of beef.
Between 1996 and 2004, the total export value of beef increased tenfold from $1.9 million to $1.9 billion, making Brazil the world’s largest beef exporter.
It has the largest commercial cattle herd of approximately 180 – 190 million head.
The government of Brazil offers loans of billions of dollars to support the expansion of its beef industry.
Approximately 200 million pounds of beef is imported by the United States from Central America every year.
While the chief importers of Brazilian beef were previously Europe and North America, nowadays Asian countries such as China and Russia consume more Brazilian beef than the European market.
So, the demand is increasing day by day.
With increasing population and increased per capita meat consumption, the rate of deforestation is increasing every day as well.
It is expected that by 2018, the beef export will increase 93 percent, thereby increasing Brazil’s beef market share of world exports to 61 percent.
Beef is the most carbon-intensive form of meat production on the planet.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization finds that beef production gives rise to more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry.
However, change may be in the air.
Many companies, NGOs, and governments have taken steps to conserve rainforests and buy only certified beef products.
Buyers of cattle products such as Nike, Timberland, Carrefour, and Wal-Mart have declared that they will buy only certified cattle products.
The NGO Alianca da Terra in Brazil is working to reduce deforestation of the Amazon due to beef production by creating incentives for producers to maintain their forest reserves.
And, the Brazilian government has recently announced plans to reduce forest clearing of an area of about 2,100 square miles per year by 2018.
In 2013, 26 Brazilian beef producers faced fines of nearly $300 million from government prosecutors for buying cattle raised illegally on deforested Amazon rainforest land.
Despite these efforts, deforestation of the Amazon due to cattle ranching is continuing.
What’s more, there are still many companies who buy significant volumes of beef knowingly from farms engaged in illegal deforestation.
Hopefully, by increasing awareness about this issue in addition to pressuring companies to change their practices, solutions can be implemented for the Amazon before it’s too late.
Soya beans are an excellent source of protein and an important part of many people’s diets.
The agricultural industry has also become reliant on these beans for animal feed.
But the drive to produce greater amounts of cheap meat and dairy is accelerating climate change and destroying forests.
Like palm oil, the global food industry has become utterly reliant on soya.
The size of the global meat and dairy industry has exploded and soya production has vastly increased to meet it.
Most soya comes from the Americas and nearly half from just two countries, Brazil and Argentina.
Growth of the soya industry has been meteoric – production in Brazil has quadrupled in just 20 years.
The UK imports huge quantities of soya and globally some 90% of soya is used to feed animals, including cows, pigs and chickens.
This rapid growth has come at a huge cost.
Vast areas of forest and natural habitats have been destroyed, replaced with mile upon mile of soya fields.
Converting forests and grasslands into monocrop farmland for soya releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which cause climate change.
Trees are very good at absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, so fewer trees means more carbon stays in the atmosphere.
Huge tracts of the forests in South America have been lost at the hands of the expanding soya industry.
People protecting the forest, including Indigenous Peoples and local activists, have been intimidated, attacked and even killed.
But since 2006, the industry has agreed not to buy soya from farmers that destroy the Amazon rainforest – and this has dramatically reduced deforestation for soya in the Brazilian Amazon.
The pioneering agreement was the result of a Greenpeace campaign that showed how McDonald’s and other food companies were selling meat reared on Amazon soya.
That doesn’t mean the struggle is over.
Soya production has also expanded into other South American forests.
The Brazilian Cerrado and the Gran Chaco – South America’s second largest forest, spanning Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay – are less well-known than the Amazon but are still home to many communities of people as well as plants and animals that are found nowhere else.
Yet they are disappearing as the soya industry ploughs up the land.
It’s astonishing, but companies that have agreed to protect the Amazon rainforest on the one hand, are at the same time also responsible for razing the Cerrado and the Gran Chaco.
Climate change and deforestation are not the only problems caused by the soya industry.
Fields are sprayed with enormous quantities of pesticides.
Since the early 1990s, pesticide use has increased by more than 170% in both Argentina and Brazil.
These chemicals wipe out other plants and insects, pollute water supplies, and cause health problems for agricultural workers.
To prevent catastrophic climate change and halt the ongoing extinction of our planet’s life, we need to stop the soya industry from devouring more forests.
The agreement which has protected the Amazon rainforest from soya production shows it can be done.
We also need to change the way we think about food.
Replacing some of the meat and dairy in our food with plant-based alternatives is also really important.
And a more sustainable approach to farming means we can produce enough food for everyone, improve our health, and look after our planet as well.
Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest.
This can include clearing the land for agriculture or grazing, or using the timber for fuel, construction or manufacturing.
Forests cover more than 30% of the Earth’s land surface, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
These forested areas can provide food, medicine and fuel for more than a billion people.
Worldwide, forests provide 13.4 million people with jobs in the forest sector, and another 41 million people have jobs related to forests.
Forests are a resource, but they are also large, undeveloped swaths of land that can be converted for purposes such as agriculture and grazing.
In North America, about half the forests in the eastern part of the continent were cut down for timber and farming between the 1600s and late 1800s, according to National Geographic.
Today, most deforestation is happening in the tropics.
Areas that were inaccessible in the past are now within reach as new roads are constructed through the dense forests.
A 2017 report by scientists at the University of Maryland showed that the tropics lost about 61,000 square miles (158,000 square kilometers) of forest in 2017 — an area the size of Bangladesh.
The World Bank estimates that about 3.9 million square miles (10 million square km) of forest have been lost since the beginning of the 20th century.
In the past 25 years, forests shrank by 502,000 square miles (1.3 million square km) — an area bigger than the size of South Africa.
In 2018, The Guardian reported that every second, a chunk of forest equivalent to the size of a soccer field is lost.
Often, deforestation occurs when forested area is cut and cleared to make way for agriculture or grazing.
The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reports that just four commodities are responsible for tropical deforestation: beef, soy, palm oil and wood products.
UCS estimates that an area the size of Switzerland (14,800 square miles, or 38,300 square km) is lost to deforestation every year.
Natural fires in tropical forests tend to be rare but intense.
Human-lit fires are commonly used to clear land for agricultural use.
First, valuable timber is harvested, then the remaining vegetation is burned to make way for crops like soy or cattle grazing.
In 2019, the number of human-lit fires in Brazil skyrocketed.
As of August 2019, more than 80,000 fires burned in the Amazon, an increase of almost 80% from 2018, National Geographic reported.
Many forests are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations.
Palm oil is the most commonly produced vegetable oil and is found in half of all supermarket products.
It’s cheap, versatile and can be added to both food and personal products like lipsticks and shampoo.
Its popularity has spurred people to clear tropical forests to grow more palm trees.
Growing the trees that produce the oil requires the leveling of native forest and the destruction of local peatlands — which doubles the harmful effect on the ecosystem.
According to a report published by Zion Market Research, the global palm oil market was valued at $65.73 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach $92.84 billion in 2021.
Forests can be found from the tropics to high-latitude areas.
They are home to 80% of terrestrial biodiversity, containing a wide array of trees, plants, animals and microbes, according to the World Bank, an international financial institution.
Some places are especially diverse — the tropical forests of New Guinea, for example, contain more than 6% of the world’s species of plants and animals.
Forests provide more than a home for a diverse collection of living things; they are also an important resource for many around the world.
In countries like Uganda, people rely on trees for firewood, timber and charcoal.
Over the past 25 years, Uganda has lost 63% of its forest cover, Reuters reported.
Families send children — primarily girls — to collect firewood, and kids have to trek farther and farther to get to the trees.
Collecting enough wood often takes all day, so the children miss school.
According to a 2018 FAO report, three-quarters of the Earth’s freshwater comes from forested watersheds, and the loss of trees can affect water quality.
The UN’s 2018 State of the World’s Forests report found that over half the global population relies on forested watersheds for their drinking water as well as water used for agriculture and industry.
Deforestation in tropical regions can also affect the way water vapor is produced over the canopy, which causes reduced rainfall.
A 2019 study published in the journal Ecohydrology showed that parts of the Amazon rainforest that were converted to agricultural land had higher soil and air temperatures, which can exacerbate drought conditions.
In comparison, forested land had rates of evapotranspiration that were about three times higher, adding more water vapor to the air.
Trees also absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity.
As climate change continues, trees play an important role in carbon sequestration, or the capture and storage of excess carbon dioxide.
Tropical trees alone are estimated to provide about 23% of the climate mitigation that’s needed to offset climate change, according to the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit global research institute.
Deforestation not only removes vegetation that is important for removing carbon dioxide from the air, but the act of clearing the forests also produces greenhouse gas emissions.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations says that deforestation is the second-leading cause of climate change.
(The first is the burning of fossil fuels.) 
In fact, deforestation accounts for nearly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.
Developing alternatives to deforestation can help decrease the need for tree clearing.
For example, the desire to expand the amount of land used for agriculture is an attractive reason to deforest an area.
But if people adopted sustainable farming practices or employed new farming technologies and crops, the need for more land might be diminished, according to the UN’s Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox.
Forests can also be restored, through replanting trees in cleared areas or simply allowing the forest ecosystem to regenerate over time.
The goal of restoration is to return the forest to its original state, before it was cleared, 
according to the U.S, The sooner a cleared area is reforested, the quicker the ecosystem can start to repair itself.
Afterward, wildlife will return, water systems will reestablish, carbon will be sequestered and soils will be replenished.
Everyone can do their part to curb deforestation.
We can buy certified wood products, go paperless whenever possible, limit our consumption of products that use palm oil and plant a tree when possible.
The main impact of global warming on the weather is an increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, cyclones, blizzards and rainstorms.
Of the 20 costliest climate and weather disasters that have occurred in the United States since 1980, eight have taken place since 2010, four of these in 2017 alone.
Such events will continue to occur more often and with greater intensity.
Episodes of intense precipitation contribute to flooding, soil erosion, landslides, and damage to structures and crops.
Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation and surface drying.
As the air warms, its water-holding capacity also increases, particularly over the oceans.
In general the air can hold about 7% more moisture for every 1 °C of temperature rise.
In the tropics, there’s more than a 10% increase in precipitation for a 1 °C increase in temperature.
Changes have already been observed in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation.
Extreme precipitation events are sometimes the result of atmospheric rivers – wide paths of atmospheric moisture composed of condensed water vapor.
Widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred even in places where total rain amounts have decreased.
Projections of future changes in precipitation show overall increases in the global average, but with substantial shifts in where and how preciptation falls.
Projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics, and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions.
In other words, regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will in general become even wetter.
This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions.
Although increased rainful will not occur everywhere, models suggest most of the world will have a 16-24% increase in heavy precipitation intensity by 2100.
Over most land areas since the 1950s, it is very likely that at all times of year both days and nights have become warmer due to human activities.
There may have been changes in other climate extremes (e.g., floods, droughts and tropical cyclones) but these changes are more difficult to identify.
Projections suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events.
Global warming boosts the probability of extreme weather events such as heat waves where the daily maximum temperature exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 °C (9 °F) for more than five consecutive days.
In the last 30–40 years, heat waves with high humidity have become more frequent and severe.
Extremely hot nights have doubled in frequency.
The area in which extremely hot summers are observed has increased 50-100 fold.
These changes are not explained by natural variability, and are attributed by climate scientists to the influence of anthropogenic climate change.
Heat waves with high humidity pose a big risk to human health while heat waves with low humidity lead to dry conditions that increase wildfires.
The mortality from extreme heat is larger than the mortality from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes together.
Global warming not only causes changes in tropical cyclones, it may also make some impacts from them worse via sea level rise.
The intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) is projected to increase globally, with the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones increasing.
Furthermore, the rate of rainfall is projected to increase, but trends in the future frequency on a global scale are not yet clear.
Changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region.
The IPCC’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere concluded that global mean sea level rose by 0.16 metres between 1901 and 2016.
The rate of sea level rise since the industrial revolution in the 19th century has been larger than the rate during the previous two thousand years.
Global sea level rise is accelerating, rising 2.5 times faster between 2006 and 2016 than it did during the 20th century.
as ocean water warms, it expands.
The second is from the melting of land-based ice in glaciers and ice sheets due to global warming.
Prior to 2007, thermal expansion was the largest component in these projections, contributing 70–75% of sea level rise.
As the impact of global warming has accelerated, melting from glaciers and ice sheets has become the main contributor.
Even if emission of greenhouse gases stops overnight (*) , sea level rise will continue for centuries to come.
In 2015, a study by Professor James Hansen of Columbia University and 16 other climate scientists said a sea level rise of three metres could be a reality by the end of the century.
Another study by scientists at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in 2017 using updated projections of Antarctic mass loss and a revised statistical method also concluded that, although it was a low probability, a three-metre rise was possible.
Rising sea levels will put hundreds of millions of people at risk in low-lying coastal areas in countries such as China, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.
The effects of climate change, in combination with the sustained increases in greenhouse gas emissions, have led scientists to characterize it as a climate emergency.
Some climate researchers and activists have called it an existential threat to civilization.
The vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries.
Wealthy industrialised countries, which have emitted the most CO2, have more resources and so are the least vulnerable to global warming.
Economic sectors that are likely to be affected include agriculture, human health, fisheries, forestry, energy, insurance, financial services, tourism, and recreation.
The quality and quantity of freshwater will likely be affected almost everywhere.
Some people may be particularly at risk from climate change, such as the poor, young children and the elderly.
Climate change will impact agriculture and food production around the world due to the effects of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere; higher temperatures; altered precipitation and transpiration regimes; increased frequency of extreme events; and modified weed, pest, and pathogen pressure.
Climate change is projected to negatively affect all four pillars of food security: not only how much food is available, but also how easy food is to access (prices), food quality and how stable the food system is.
As of 2019, negative impacts have been observed for some crops in low-latitudes (maize and wheat), while positive impacts of climate change have been observed in some crops in high-latitudes (maize, wheat, and sugar beets).
Using different methods to project future crop yields, a consistent picture emerges of global decreases in yield.
Maize and soybean decrease with any warming, whereas rice and wheat production might peak at 3 °C of warming.
In many areas, fisheries have already seen their catch decrease because of global warming and changes in biochemical cycles.
In combination with overfishing, warming waters decrease the maximum catch potential.
Global catch potential is projected to reduce further in 2050 by less than 4% if emissions are reduced strongly, and by about 8% for very high future emissions, with growth in the Arctic Ocean.
Climate change impacts depend strongly on projected future social and economic development.
As of 2019, an estimated 831 million people are undernourished.
Under a high emission scenario (RCP6.0), cereals are projected to become 1-29% more expensive in 2050 depending on the socioeconomic pathway, particularly affecting low-income consumers.
Compared to a no climate change scenario, this would put between 1-181 million extra people at risk of hunger.
Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming; and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.
Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas.
Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture for livestock.
A number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect water resources.
These include changes in precipitation, the cryosphere and surface waters (e.g., changes in river flows).
Observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature, sea level and precipitation variability.
Changes in temperature are correlated with variability in precipitation because the water cycle is reactive to temperature.
Temperature increases change precipitation patterns.
Excessive precipitation leads to excessive sediment deposition, nutrient pollution, and concentration of minerals in aquifers.
The rising global temperature will cause sea level rise and will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas.
The rising sea level will push the salt gradient into freshwater deposits and will eventually pollute freshwater sources.
The 2014 fifth IPCC assessment report concluded that:Water resources are projected to decrease in most dry subtropical regions and mid-latitudes, but increase in high latitudes.
As stream-flow becomes more variable, even regions with increased water resources can experience additional short-term shortages.
Per degree warming, a model average of 7% of the world population is expected to have at least 20% less renewable water resource.
Climate change is projected to reduce water quality before treatment.
Even after conventional treatments, risks remain.
The quality reduction is a consequence of higher temperatures, more intense rainfall, droughts and disruption of treatment facilities during floods.
Droughts that stress water supply are expected to increase in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central and southern North America, Central America, northeast Brazil, and southern Africa.
Wild animals suffer not only the collateral damage of meat-related deforestation, drought, pollution and climate change, but also direct targeting by the meat industry.
From grazing animals to predators, native species are frequently killed to protect meat-production profits.
Grass-eating species such as elk, deer and pronghorn have been killed en masse to reserve more feed for cattle.
Important habitat-creating animals such as beavers and prairie dogs have been decimated because they disrupt the homogenous landscapes desired by livestock managers.
"Predator control" programs designed to protect the livestock industry helped drive keystone predators like California grizzly bears and Mexican gray wolves extinct in their ecosystems.
Adding insult to injury — and flying in the face of modern conservation science — the livestock industry remains the leading stodgy opponent to otherwise-popular efforts to recover species like the Mexican gray wolf in Arizona and New Mexico.
A recent article about the connection between livestock production and the decline of wolves and other carnivores describes some of the brutal methods used to target predators:
“To support a global rise in per-capita meat-eating, livestock farming continues to expand, shrinking and fragmenting natural habitats in the process.
And when cramped predators adapt by preying upon livestock, some ranchers go to extreme measures to keep them away, such as strapping pouches of neurotoxins to the necks of grazing lambs, or calling upon the United States Department of Agriculture to shoot down predators from government helicopters.” 
More than 175 threatened or endangered species are imperiled by livestock on federal lands , where livestock grazing is promoted, protected and subsidized on 270 million acres of our public lands in 11 western states.
Livestock grazing — not including the large portion of agriculture devoted to cattle production or other forms of meat production — is among the greatest direct threats to imperiled species, affecting 14 percent of threatened or endangered animals and 33 percent of threatened or endangered plants .
In addition, at the behest of ranchers, a federal agency known as Wildlife Services shoots, traps, and poisons millions of animals every year, including wolves and foxes and bears in National Forests, to make more room for cows and other ranched animals.
Animal agriculture is responsible for at least 14.5 percent of human-induced global greenhouse gas emissions.
In the United States cattle emit about 5.5 million metric tons of methane — a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide — accounting for 20 percent of the country’s methane emissions .
In addition to the astounding levels of emissions that come from the feeding, digestion and transportation involved in raising livestock, the staggering amount of land used for feed crops and grazing multiplies the carbon hoofprint of meat consumption.
Global warming presents the gravest threat to life on Earth.
Meat production is a major contributor to the rising temperatures that are further altering or eliminating habitat, reducing food sources, and causing drought beyond the immediate demands of raising livestock.
Habitat Loss, Water Use and Pollution
In the United States, 80 percent of agricultural land is used for raising animals and feed crops.
That’s almost half the land mass of the lower 48 states dedicated to feeding the nation’s taste for beef, chicken and pork .
More than half of the grain grown in the country goes toward feeding livestock, and nearly half of the water used goes toward meat production .

Grazing is a serious threat to wildlife and ecosystems, particularly on federal lands.
The ecological costs of livestock grazing exceed that of any other western land use — yet it’s highly subsidized by the government, under pressure from Big Ag.
In the arid Southwest, livestock grazing is the most widespread cause of wildlife endangerment.
By destroying vegetation, damaging wildlife habitats and disrupting natural processes, such grazing wreaks ecological havoc on riparian areas, rivers, deserts, grasslands and forests alike — causing significant harm to native species and the ecosystems on which they depend.
Grazing cattle destroy native vegetation, damage soils and stream banks, and contaminate waterways with fecal waste.
After decades of livestock grazing, once-lush streams and riparian forests have been reduced to flat, dry wastelands; once-rich topsoil has been turned to dust, causing soil erosion, stream sedimentation and wholesale elimination of many aquatic habitats; overgrazing of fire-carrying grasses has starved some western forests of fire, making them overly dense and prone to unnaturally severe fires.
Most U.S. cattle are “finished” in feedlots, where thousands of animals are kept closely confined in pens and fed a diet of grain, antibiotics and other ingredients to prepare them for slaughter.
Pigs and chickens are also typically raised in “concentrated animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs.
In addition to inhumane conditions for the farm animals, CAFOs generate massive amounts of waste, which causes air and water pollution.
Livestock produce 500 million tons of manure per year .
Agricultural pollution is a leading source of water-quality problems, with factory farms polluting 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminating groundwater in 17 states, in addition to impairing wetlands, lakes and estuaries .
Meat production is also responsible for 80 percent of antibiotic use and 37 percent of pesticide use , creating health threats to children and wildlife.
Causes of climate change
Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests and farming livestock.
This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.
Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space.
Many of these gases occur naturally, but human activity is increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:
CO2 is the greenhouse gas most commonly produced by human activities and it is responsible for 64% of man-made global warming.
Its concentration in the atmosphere is currently 40% higher than it was when industrialisation began.
Other greenhouse gases are emitted in smaller quantities, but they trap heat far more effectively than CO2, and in some cases are thousands of times stronger.
Methane is responsible for 17% of man-made global warming, nitrous oxide for 6%.
Causes for rising emissions
Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.
Cutting down forests (deforestation) .
Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere.
So when they are cut down, that beneficial effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect.
Increasing livestock farming.
Cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their food.
Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions.
Fluorinated gases produce a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2.
Thankfully these are released in smaller quantities and are being phased down by EU regulation.
The current global average temperature is 0.85ºC higher than it was in the late 19th century.
Each of the past three decades has been warmer than any preceding decade since records began in 1850.
The world's leading climate scientists think human activities are almost certainly the main cause of the warming observed since the middle of the 20th century.
An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is seen by scientists as the threshold beyond which there is a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.
For this reason, the international community has recognised the need to keep warming below 2°C.
Nowadays, with rapid population growth, the problem of burning forests for slash-and-burn cultivation is increasingly common to serve human needs.
This has led to an imbalance in the ecosystems as well as wild animals lose their food and habitat.
In addition, the trend pollutes the environment from dust emitted by the burning of forests and lacks trees to clean the air.
Therefore, the reduction of forest burning activities for slash-and-burn cultivation is urgent and necessary to minimize the above-mentioned disadvantages.
Large cities where high population density, high traffic density, and the presence of industrial zones have caused serious air pollution there.
The air is not clean, human breathing also becomes difficult which is related to lung diseases.
If this continued, life would be in danger.
Therefore, protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us.
Feasible measures are to use public transport or jogging instead of private vehicles.
The government should have programs to stimulate and raise people’s awareness of environmental protection.
One of the most frequently mentioned issues about the environment is water resources.
We cannot live without fresh water, but we destroy water resources by activities such as dumping trash indiscriminately into rivers and lakes or fishing with chemicals.
This has seriously polluted the water source.
If this is not stopped in time, we will not have clean water for living in the near future.
Therefore, all individuals and organizations should be aware of the importance of environmental protection and join hands in environmental protection.
Pollution Clouds Vietnam's Rapid Economic Growth
The air quality in Vietnam overall does not quite rival that in China or India when it comes to pollution.
And all that toxic air comes with a cost, whether in the money spent to upgrade to cleaner fuels, or in the health problems Vietnamese will suffer as a result.
Environmental economist Le Viet Phu says sooner or later there will be a price to pay.
He is urging Vietnamese to take the long view and put up with the higher cost of clean energy, though it might be painful for their pocketbooks at first.
And this statistic might give them a wake-up call: Vietnam now has the dubious distinction of joining the club of 10 countries with the worst air pollution in the world, according to the U.S.consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.
The consulate’s air quality monitor has become a daily reference for residents ever since it was installed in 2015, along with a similar device at the embassy in Hanoi.
“In Vietnam the last 10 years, we developed very rapidly because of low energy prices,” said Phu, who works at Fulbright University Vietnam.
Postwar economic improvements have brought Vietnam a long way, but some are pausing now to reflect on the tradeoffs made in that time.
Gross domestic product expands 6 to 7 percent every year.
Meanwhile, though, the frequency of days when Ho Chi Minh City’s air is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups has doubled compared to two years ago.
