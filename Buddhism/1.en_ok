Introduction
But the payoff is happiness—not just for today but for always.
What Happiness Is and What It Isn’t
It’s a paradox that the more we have, the greater our possibility for unhappiness.
The Sources of Happiness
The Buddha once described several categories of happiness, placing them in order from the most fleeting to the most profound.
It includes all the fleeting worldly happiness derived from sense indulgence, physical pleasure, and material satisfaction: the happiness of possessing wealth, nice clothes, a new car, or a pleasing home; the enjoyment that comes from seeing beautiful things, listening to good music, eating good food, and enjoying pleasant conversations; the satisfaction of being skilled in painting, playing the piano, and the like; and the happiness that comes from sharing a warm family life.
Just as these five strings—the five sense pleasures—can hold down a baby but not a mature adult, who easily breaks free, so a discerning person breaks free from the idea that indulging the five senses makes life meaningful and happy.
The Trap of Unhappiness
Because of feeling, there is craving; as a result of craving, there is pursuit; with pursuit, there is gain; in dependence upon gain, there is decision-making; with decision-making, there are desire and lust, which lead to attachment; attachment creates possessiveness, which leads to stinginess; in dependence upon stinginess, there is safeguarding; and because of safeguarding, various evil, unwholesome phenomena [arise]—conflicts, quarrels, insulting speech, and falsehoods.

Skillful Understanding
THE STORY OF THE BUDDHA’S LIFE is familiar to many of us.
We know that Prince Siddhattha left his father’s lavish palace, took up the homeless life of a wandering spiritual seeker, and after years of rigorous practice, attained enlightenment while meditating under the Bodhi Tree.
When the Buddha arose from meditation, he walked to the city of Benares, now called Varanasi.
There, in the Deer Park, he taught for the first time what he had discovered about the path to permanent happiness.
The Buddha’s message was simple but profound.
Neither a life of self-indulgence nor one of self-mortification can bring happiness.
Only a middle path, avoiding these two extremes, leads to peace of mind, wisdom, and complete liberation from the dissatisfactions of life.
The message of the Buddha is traditionally known as the Four Noble Truths.
The last of these four truths sets out eight steps to happiness.
He taught us to cultivate skillfulness in our understanding, thinking, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.
You’ll notice that three aspects—understanding, effort, and mindfulness—come up repeatedly in each step.
These are the cardinal points of the path.
All the steps are intertwined, but no step functions without the strong application of understanding, effort, and mindfulness.
You walk this path by bringing mindful awareness to every aspect of your daily life, continually working toward greater wholesomeness and applying proper understanding.
As the mind settles down, insights begin to arise.
Other insights feel profound, as though the whole earth has been shaken by your new knowledge.
There may be a feeling of release, followed by a powerful sense of well-being or bliss that can last for hours or even for days.
These wonderful experiences are not enlightenment.
They just hint at what full enlightenment may be like.
But there may come a moment when all the factors of the eight steps are in place.
Morality is perfected; concentration is deep and strong; the mind is bright and clear without any hindrances present.
Then you may have a most profound insight—that all experience is impersonal and impermanent in every way, that nothing is worth clinging to.
At that moment, all your doubts disappear, and the way you see everything changes.
From that time on, you walk the path on a whole new level.
After that profound insight, your understanding reaches a higher level, called the “beyond worldly” level, and you proceed with supreme confidence.
You know that no matter what, you will reach your goal.
In anything we do, the first step is to know why we’re doing it.
That’s why the Buddha made Skillful Understanding the first step on his path to happiness.
He wanted us to understand that the Buddhist path is not some abstract notion of “promising to be good” so that we can get some reward, not some mysterious code of behavior we have to follow to belong to a secret club.
Rather, the Buddha’s path is grounded in common sense and in careful observation of reality.
He knew that if we open our eyes and look carefully at our lives, we will understand that the choices we make lead either to happiness or unhappiness.
Once we understand this principle thoroughly, we will make good choices, because we do want to be happy.
Buddhists may describe actions as being right or wrong, good or bad, moral or immoral, but they intend a somewhat different meaning than these words usually convey.
“Skillful or unskillful” probably explains the idea best.
The basis of Buddhist morality is that acting in unskillful ways leads to unhappy results, and acting in skillful ways leads to happy results.
This simple principle of cause and effect is an aspect of what Buddhists call kamma .
Even though unskillful deeds may bring temporary happiness—when, for example, a drug dealer is pleased with his shiny new car, or when you feel self-righteous gratification in causing pain to someone who has hurt you—the Buddha pointed out that wrong actions always lead to harm.
Our own observations confirm this truth.
Some of the harm may not be visible, such as the mental suffering of guilt and remorse.
Other kinds of harm may not manifest immediately.
The results of skillful and unskillful actions, the Buddha explained, may come to someone far, far in the future, even beyond this lifetime.
You may think, “I’m not worried about a future lifetime, I just want what I can get out of this life.
” The Buddha advised us to consider these possibilities: Even if there is no future life, doing wholesome things will bring me happiness and a clear conscience in this life.
If it turns out that there is a future life beyond death, I will be doubly rewarded—now and again later.
On the other hand, if there is no future life, acting in an unwholesome way will make me feel miserable and guilty in this life.
And if it turns out that there really is a future life beyond death, I will suffer again later.
Thus, whether there is a future life or not, letting go of unwholesomeness and cultivating wholesomeness guarantees our happiness.
Once we understand that everything we think, say, or do is a cause that leads inevitably to some effect, now or in the future, we will naturally want to think, say, and do things that lead to positive results and avoid those thoughts, words, and deeds that lead to negative ones.
Recognizing that causes always lead to results helps us accept the consequences of past actions.
It also helps us focus our attention on making choices that can lead to a happier future.
Skillful actions are those that create the causes for happiness, such as actions motivated by loving-friendliness and compassion.
Any action that comes from a mind not currently filled with greed, hatred, or delusion brings happiness to the doer and to the receiver.
Such an action is, therefore, skillful or right.
Suppose, for example, that you consistently cultivate generosity and loving-friendliness toward all.
This good behavior is a cause.
People around you may be angry and unhappy, but you won’t be.
Your positive behavior has generated two types of immediate results.
The first is internal—how you feel.
Since you have been consistently generous and loving and have reflected upon your acts of generosity and love, your mind is peaceful and happy.
The second is external: other people appreciate you and care for you.
While their caring is certainly pleasant, it is less important than how you feel.
Since external effects are dependent on the response of others, they are less reliable.
Once we understand this principle, its opposite also becomes clear.
The Buddha pointed to ten actions that are always unskillful because they inevitably cause suffering.
Three are actions of the body: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
Four are actions of speech: lying, malicious words, harsh language, and useless talk.
The last three are actions of the mind: covetousness, ill will, and wrong view of the nature of reality.
What is meant by each of these ten actions and how we can avoid them is explained in detail in later steps of the path.
Before we can even begin to practice the Buddha’s path, however, we need enough basic understanding to see that these ten actions are unskillful because they inevitably bring deep suffering both to the doers and the recipients.
Refraining from these ten actions is not a list of commandments but a set of voluntary principles to follow out of conviction.
Nobody can force them upon you.
You have to find out for yourself, from your own experience and from your observations of the experiences of others, whether such actions lead to positive results or negative ones.
Your experience will tell you that unskillful behaviors bring about physical and psychological pain to yourself and others.
Moreover, people engage in such misdeeds only when their understanding is faulty and their minds are polluted by greed, hatred, or delusion.
In fact, any action that comes from a mind filled with greed, hatred, or delusion leads to suffering and is thus unskillful or wrong.
Buddhist morality is rational behavior based on this principle of cause and effect.
You have to be lying to yourself about causes and effects to act wrongfully.
The worse your behavior, the bigger your lie has to be.
What deep insight, what release, will you ever reach if you deliberately feed your delusions with behavior that goes against this basic truth that actions have consequences?
If you engage in seriously wrongful behavior, you won’t gain much clarity—let alone liberating insight—from the Buddha’s path.
You must embrace this morality.
That’s essential.
Mindfulness meditation increases awareness of the devastating consequences of immoral behavior.
The meditator vividly experiences the painful effects of unwholesome thoughts, words, and deeds and urgently feels the need to give them all up.
You alone are the author of your future—experience teaches you that.
Your behavior is not an unchangeable law of nature.
At every moment, you have the opportunity to change—to alter your thoughts, your speech, your actions.
If you train yourself to be mindful of what you do, and ask yourself whether it’s likely to lead to positive results or negative, you’ll be guiding yourself in the right direction.
Repeated good intentions can generate a powerful inner voice that will keep you on track.
It will remind you—whenever you trap yourself in a cycle of unhappiness—that you can get out of that trap.
Periodically you will have glimpses of what it is like to be free.
You make this vision a reality by acting in positive ways and letting go of misery.
Thus morality—defined as actions in accordance with reality—is the foundation of all spiritual progress.
Without this, nothing of the path will work to reduce suffering.
Now you must add to it a good comprehension of the Four Noble Truths.
The Buddha himself said that he taught only four ideas: dissatisfaction, cause, end, and path.
“Dissatisfaction” refers to the unhappiness we feel in our lives.
“Cause” is the reason for this unhappiness: our undisciplined, grasping mind.
“End” is the Buddha’s promise that we can end suffering by eradicating our craving.
“Path” is the eight steps we must take to reach this goal.
In his forty-five years of teaching, from the time of his first sermon in the Deer Park until his death, the Buddha explained these four words hundreds of times.
He wanted to make sure that these essential ideas could be understood by people with different temperaments at various stages of spiritual growth.
On one occasion, he explained that dissatisfaction with the suffering of life is a burden.
We cause our dissatisfaction by taking up the burden.
We end it by putting the burden down.
The path tells us how to unburden ourselves.
Another time, he called dissatisfaction a sickness.
Like a doctor, the Buddha diagnoses the cause of the sickness.
The end of the sickness is Dr. Buddha’s cure, and the path is the medicine he prescribes to make us well.
Understanding the First Truth: Dissatisfaction
The Buddha’s first truth tells us that dissatisfaction is unavoidable.
But doesn’t our current technological know-how allow us to do whatever we want, go anywhere we wish, and manufacture anything we need?”
Yet, no matter how easy and safe our modern lives may seem, the truth of dissatisfaction has not changed.
It is as relevant now as it was in the Buddha’s time.
People back then were dissatisfied, and so are we.
We may call the Buddha’s first truth any number of names depending on the situation: suffering, stress, fear, tension, anxiety, worry, depression, disappointment, anger, jealousy, abandonment, nervousness, or pain.
All human beings, no matter when or where they live, are subject to these problems.
We may fall ill at any time.
We may be separated from our loved ones.
We may lose what we have or be forced by circumstances to put up with conditions we despise.
Parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends, communities and countries—all quarrel over wealth, position, power, and boundaries.
Some of these problems are created by greed, some by hatred, others by ignorance.
All of them relate to conditions both in the world—social, political, economic, educational, environmental—and in ourselves.
Recognizing the inevitability of these problems triggers pain in our minds.
Acknowledging them and accepting them as they really are, without blaming others, is the essence of the Buddha’s first truth.
To get started toward happiness, he told us, we need to look at dissatisfaction straight on—with stable emotions and a steady mind—without getting angry or feeling depressed or pessimistic.
We must look squarely at our predicament: every experience of life brings some degree of suffering to anyone not fully enlightened.
The suffering may be extremely subtle, perhaps an underlying subtle restlessness.
Or it may be more obvious, some strong attachment to a person, possession, or opinion.
It all depends on how much greed, hatred, and delusion we have, and on our personalities and past experiences.
Consider, for example, two people who witness the same event but have completely different impressions.
One finds the event happy and agreeable; the other, frightening and terrible.
Happiness and its opposite are mind-made.
Our minds create our life experiences, and our minds either enjoy those creations or suffer because of them.
That is why the Buddha spoke of our creating heaven and hell in this very life.
Until we attain enlightenment, many kinds of experiences cause powerful dissatisfaction for us all.
Let’s look at three: the life cycle, change, and having no control of our lives.
The inevitable round of the human life cycle—birth, aging, sickness, death—gives rise to dissatisfaction.
Babies are not born with big smiles on their faces.
As we grow, the cry with which we first greeted the world becomes less audible.
We might say that it changes to an inward cry that continues for the rest of our lives.
We cry for so many gallons of milk; so many tons of food; so many yards of clothes; so many square feet of land for housing, schools, and hospitals; so many trees for making books, papers, furniture; so many pills for various sicknesses; so many people to love us; so many ways to try to fill our neediness.
If we had not been born into this unsatisfactory world, all other kinds of dissatisfaction would not come into existence.
With every baby, it seems, unhappiness, too, is born.
Society as a whole also suffers as a result of birth.
We’ve probably forgotten the adjustments we made in childhood to a new neighborhood or a new teacher, but we can remember the difficulties we had as teenagers adjusting to our changing bodies and emotions.
Uncomfortable changes seem to be common to every stage of life.
As we grow old, the problem of adjusting to change becomes more conspicuous.
It is painful to lose the physical well-being we had when we were young.
We know that aging is inevitable, but we wish it were not.
Thus we suffer.
We know that every cell in our body is decaying or dying, and new cells are continually taking their place.
Every state of mind also disappears and a new one arises.
Eventually, this process of decay and change weakens the body and mind, causing our physical death.
Illness is obviously another cause of dissatisfaction.
Everybody knows how painful sickness is.
Sickness actually causes two kinds of pain: fear of sickness and its direct experience.
Thus sickness is a continuing source of anxiety, causing suffering when we are ill and fear when we are healthy.
People generally think that pain and dissatisfaction are synonymous, but they are not.
Though you can’t avoid the pain of injury and disease, it is possible to avoid dissatisfaction as a result of the pain.
For instance, when Devadatta threw a rock and wounded the Buddha’s foot, the Buddha experienced pain.
But because he understood the nature of pain, he did not suffer like ordinary people.
Pain sensations are usually manageable.
Dissatisfaction with “what is” is more profound and harder to overcome.
The fourth form of suffering in the life cycle is death—not just the moment of death but also everything that leads up it.
We all fear death and worry about how and when we might die.
We also know that when we die, we will have to leave everything behind.
But the dissatisfactions of the life cycle do not end with death.
The Buddha taught that death does not bring the cycle of dissatisfaction to a close.
Someone who has gone through a lot may say, when nearing death, “I don’t want any more of this.”
But that mere wish cannot stop the life cycle from continuing.
As long as we are ignorant of the true nature of reality, this life links to another.
As long as desire, hatred, and ignorance exist in our consciousness, the endless round of rebirth—the cycle of past, present, and future lives—will continue.
Within that cycle, the dissatisfactions that we have mentioned recur again and again.
The energy of all these experiences is like a backpack that we carry from life to life through countless rebirths.
In each new life, its contents are simply transferred into new baggage.
When we die, nothing material goes with us.
Yet that same backpack of energy—the imprints of all the mental activities and all the intentional words and deeds of this and previous lifetimes—not only travels with us but actually initiates the new life.
Until we have emptied our backpacks—until we have exhausted the results of all we have created through desire, hatred, or ignorance over countless lifetimes—we cannot escape perpetual death and rebirth.
We can use this thought to motivate us to do whatever we can in this lifetime to achieve the permanent happiness of liberation.
Ignorance in the Buddhist sense is both “not knowing”—as in not knowing what the Buddha meant by the Four Noble Truths—and “wrong knowing”—believing that we understand the way the world works when we do not.
Ignorant of how the energy of our words and deeds travels with us from this life to the next, we allow greed, hatred, doubt, and jealousy to motivate us.
Ignorant that a simple and disciplined life, good friends, meditation, and mindful investigation of the true nature of our experience will bring us happiness in this life and in lives to come, we make millions of excuses for not engaging in these positive activities.
We are ignorant even of our ignorance.
Because of his ignorance, Ananda’s understanding of the Buddha’s message was not yet complete, and thus he did not attain liberation at that moment.
Like Ananda, our ignorance keeps us spinning through the life cycle’s many dissatisfactions.
Change also dissatisfies us.
No matter what we do, change separates us from what we love and presents us with what we hate.
Death and distance divide us from people we love.
Friends move away.
Such separations hurt a lot.
Losing anything to which we are attached makes us angry and sad.
Even something trivial can cause grief when it breaks or disappears.
Once when I was four years old I drew a perfect circle around me with my finger tip as I sat in the sand.
I became so angry I chased her, picked up a small but heavy wooden bench, and threw it at her.
She still has a scar on one of her toes.
All that upset and rage, all those tears and pain, caused by something so silly and transient as a circle in the sand!
Not only do we lose things we love, we are continually confronted by people and conditions we wish did not exist—at least not here, not right now.
Living or working day in, day out with someone we do not like causes much unhappiness.
Even something we cannot control, like the weather, makes us dissatisfied.
At the Bhavana Society in West Virginia where I teach, people complain when it is hot and sticky.
But they also complain when it is rainy and cool.
When it is dry, they complain that their skin or their sinuses are affected.
When it is cold, they complain because they fear they will slip on the ice.
And when the weather is perfect, they complain that they do not have time to enjoy it!
When we look around us, it’s clear that everything that exists causes dissatisfaction.
Changes in the barometric pressure, winds, and temperature are causes of rain.
A tree is caused by the seed from which it grows and the sunlight, soil, and water that nurture it.
Our lives, too are the product of causes and conditions—the direct physical cause of our parents’ procreation and the cause of the energetic imprints we accumulated during our previous lifetimes.
The Buddha called these and everything else that arises from causes “conditioned things.”
He explained that all conditioned things are characterized by three qualities.
First, they are impermanent.
Over time, everything—mountains and mayflies, marshmallows and microchips—breaks down, changes, or dies.
Second, because of these changes, all conditioned things are unsatisfactory.
As we have seen, every changing thing can give rise to suffering.
Third, all conditioned things are selfless or soulless.
This last quality is the most difficult to understand, so let’s put it aside for a moment.
Impermanence is pretty easy to understand.
The fact that things are temporary is not the problem.
Rather, it’s the attachment we have to people and things—like my circle in the sand—that makes us unhappy.
Say we have a new jacket that we like enormously.
A ruined or lost jacket is no great tragedy, of course, and we can easily replace it.
But what if the jacket was a gift from someone we love?
Sometimes people get upset when they hear discussions like this.
“How about happiness?” they ask.
The answer, my friends, is change.
Because of impermanence, anything that is pleasant, happy, or delightful, does not remain so.
As intelligent, mature people, we must talk about what’s really happening without getting upset.
We must look it right in the eye, this dissatisfaction caused by change, and acknowledge it.
Why hide it and pretend that everything’s rosy?
When we look at change head on, we may begin to see that it has an up side as well.
We can count on the fact that whatever conditions exist in our lives will also change.
Things may get worse.
But they may also improve.
Because of impermanence, we have the opportunity to learn, develop, grow, teach, memorize, and make other positive changes, including practicing the Buddha’s path.
If everything about us were set in concrete, none of these changes would be possible.
The uneducated would stay uneducated.
The poor and hungry would stay poor and hungry.
We would have no chance to end our hatred, greed, or ignorance and their negative consequences.
Okay, we understand impermanence and the dissatisfaction it causes.
We and everything around us are not static, permanent entities.
We cannot affix a “me” or “mine” label to anything in the universe.
It all changes too quickly.
For convenience, we may say “I am here” or “this belongs to me,” but we should say these words wisely and not be fooled into thinking that they imply the existence of an unchanging entity, the “I” or “me.
” Physical objects also change continually.
We may use conventional labels and say “this is a chair” or “this is a chimpanzee,” but these labels barely fit the changing reality that we experience.
Rather, we and everything else are in process, in a continual flux of growth and decay, buildup and breakdown.
Nothing about our world or ourselves is separate or enduring.
Watch your mind for one minute and you’ll see what I mean.
Memories, emotions, ideas, sensations flicker across the screen of consciousness so quickly we can hardly catch them.
Therefore, it makes no sense for the mind to grab on to any of these passing shadows with attachment or to push them away with hatred.
When our mindful attention is quick and sharp, as it is in a state of deep concentration, then we can clearly see the changes—so clearly that there is no room left for belief in a self.
Some people feel depressed and disappointed when they hear about the doctrine of non-self.
Some even become angry.
They mistakenly conclude that life has no meaning.
They don’t understand that a life lived without a sense of self is most pleasant and meaningful.
Once I gave a manuscript of an article to a friend to edit.
He was a professional editor, and I figured that the job would take him about an hour.
Yet for six months I heard nothing from him.
He finally came for a visit, and we went for a walk.
When he said nothing about my article, I sensed this would be a delicate topic.
Very gently and hesitantly I broached the subject.
I asked, “Have you had time to take a look at my article?” He remained silent for a long moment and then replied, “Bhante G, I looked at it.
When I came across the teaching of non-self, I became so angry I threw away the whole manuscript!” I was amazed, but I did not get upset with him.
Instead I let go of my attachment to the article I had written.
He had thrown away my manuscript because of non-self, so I threw away the self associated with the manuscript.
I was able to stay relaxed, friendly, and peaceful.
This man, however, became rigid, uptight, and unhappy, due to his clinging to self.
So you see how hard it can be to accept this notion of non-self.
Yet so long as you retain this notion of self you’ll feel uncomfortable, rigid, and grasping, and people will find your egotistical self unpleasant.
You’ll get upset or angry when someone disagrees with you or blames you for something, when things disappoint you or don’t go your way, and even when somebody offers you constructive criticism.
Correctly understanding this idea of non-self, you’ll feel relaxed and comfortable.
You’ll mix easily with people of any nationality, you won’t feel any more or less important than others, you’ll adapt easily to any situation, and everyone will feel comfortable around you.
By truly understanding selflessness you can feel happy and comfortable wherever you go, whether you are treated well or ill.
Don’t let this teaching make you depressed and don’t let it make you angry.
For now, we must be content with trying to accept this idea intellectually.
As our practice of mindfulness continues, however, we can look forward to the day when we will perceive the selflessness and soullessness of all phenomena directly.
When we do, the unhappiness that comes as a result of change will end for us, forever.
The Buddha and the other great beings who have attained full enlightenment are proof of this.
The Buddha was completely free of the concept of “I.
” Of course, the Buddha continued to live in society after he achieved enlightenment.
For conventional purposes and to make communication easy, he continued to use conventional terms, such as “I” or “me.
” It’s okay if you do as well.
The name on your driver’s license may not be an absolutely accurate label, a guarantee of your permanent identity, but it’s a convenient handle for the conventions of everyday life.
But when mindfulness leads you to realize that the “self” you have been protecting so vigorously is, in fact, an illusion—a stream of constantly changing sensations, emotions, and physical states, with no permanence or fixed identity—then there will be no “you” to attach to the impermanent things of this world, and thus no reason for you to be dissatisfied or unhappy.
If we were really in control of our lives, we’d have no reason to be dissatisfied.
But we’re not in control.
Time after time we don’t get what we want, and we get what we don’t want.
We want our perfect job, perfect office, perfect boss, and perfect pay to continue forever, but they change, and we have no say about why or when.
We want to keep our loved ones, but no matter how tightly we cling to them, someday we’ll be separated.
To stay healthy we take herbs and vitamins, work out, and eat right, but we still get sick.
We want to remain young and strong and hope that old age will happen only to others, but years pass and we discover that our body has other plans.
Whatever ideal situation we’re in, we naturally wish to hold on to it.
But we have no control over the law of impermanence.
Everything exists by consent of this law, and we have no protection against it.
It’s also painful to have things happen to us that we never wished for.
You’re stung by a bee.
Your favorite TV show is canceled.
Someone breaks into your car.
You lose your job.
A loved one gets cancer.
Your precious wedding pictures or baseball memorabilia are lost in a fire.
Your child has an accident or gets involved in drugs.
Scandal, blame, shame, failure, hunger, loss of goods, loss of love, physical deterioration—so many bad, unwanted things happen to us and to the people we wish to protect.
And we have no control over any of it.
If we look carefully, we can see that even getting our wishes fulfilled is also unsatisfying.
Say what you wish for is a beautiful house.
So, you buy it, and look at the trouble you have to go through.
You have to pay the mortgage, pay the taxes, protect it, secure it, insure it, decorate it, repair and maintain it.
And then, you’re not home very much anyway.
Early in the morning, you go to work.
The house is very big and very beautiful, no doubt.
And you keep paying the bills and cutting the grass and fixing the roof and cleaning out the garage.
You have gotten what you wished for, but are you happy?
Look at another example.
A boy likes a girl, and she likes him.
Each works very hard to attract the other.
But from the moment they start their relationship, they are afraid.
He fears that she’ll fall for some guy who is more handsome, and she fears a more attractive woman will steal him.
Jealousy, suspicion, worry.
Is this happiness?
You can think of other examples.
Just read the newspaper.
The Buddha tried to make it very clear that every single thing in life brings suffering for the unenlightened person.
He listed “five aggregates” that include every possible aspect of reality: form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness.
“Form” refers to all material existence—including the body and things that are contacted through the senses.
The other four aggregates cover all mental experience.
At the end of a list of all the things that bring suffering, the Buddha said, “In short, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering.”
How this works is very subtle.
We know that we perceive the world through our senses.
We generally talk about five senses, through which we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.
What our senses actually perceive is the raw data of experience or, in the case of the mind, mental pictures of experience—color, shape, size, intensity, pitch, hardness, and grossness or subtlety.
We know, of course, that perception can differ from person to person depending on the perceiver’s state of mind and senses.
A person with a bad cold may have difficulty smelling or tasting.
A person whose hearing is impaired may not hear low-pitched sounds.
So perception is subjective, depending on the faculties of the person perceiving.
We’re aware of these differences, but our mind plays a trick on us.
It convinces us that our perception is solid and reliable.
Not only that.
After we perceive something, our mind immediately categorizes or judges whatever it is and puts the thing or experience into one of three boxes.
The first box is labeled pleasant perceptions—the smell of fresh baked bread, a violin concerto, a brilliant sunset.
The second holds unpleasant perceptions—the memory of our father’s death, a headache, the wail of a police siren.
Into the third go neutral perceptions—all those things and experiences about which we have a neutral reaction.
Then, of course, because our minds are not completely free of attachment, we cling to the pleasant.
Because of aversion, we push away the unpleasant.
And because of ignorance, we ignore the neutral, and we regard all objects—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—as permanent, as possessing a self or soul, and as capable of giving us permanent happiness or causing us permanent misery.
The Buddha explained the effect of this mistaken or unwholesome perception this way:
Depending on the eye and forms, eye consciousness arises.
The meeting of the three is contact.
With contact as a condition, there is feeling.
Realistic or wholesome perception, on the other hand, neither clings nor pushes away.
It perceives impermanence as it is, dissatisfaction as it is, and selflessness as it is.
When we perceive the world in a wholesome way, we cultivate wholesome thoughts.
Realistic perception is powerfully therapeutic.
If we could see objects and people as they truly are—as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless or soulless—nothing that we perceive could make us unhappy.
Realistic perception is the goal of mindfulness meditation.
Being realistic means not running away from unpleasant facts about ourselves and our world.
Through mindful awareness, we learn to look realistically at existence, which is not always beautiful, pleasant, or happy.
We see that life is a mixture of pain and pleasure.
We notice physical or mental suffering at its very birth and watch how it arises.
We also observe how long it remains and how it disappears.
Mindfulness meditation acts like a shock absorber.
If you’ve grown accustomed to facing the dissatisfactions of everyday life and know that they are natural occurrences, when some difficult or painful situation comes your way you’ll face it bravely and calmly.
When we can look into the face of suffering without flinching, we will also be able to recognize true happiness.
Understanding the Second Truth: The Cause of Dissatisfaction
The Buddha’s second truth tells us that the cause of our dissatisfaction is desire, which we might also call attachment, greed, or grasping.
It doesn’t seem to matter what it is—a fine meal, a dear friend, an exalted spiritual goal—if we’re attached, we’ll feel dissatisfied and suffer.
Even plants seem to have some kind of desire, for they turn toward the sun for light and warmth.
Another source of desire is social conditioning—all those views and values that we learn from parents, family, friends, schools, advertising, and books that condition us to believe that some things are good and others are bad.
The strongest desire is that based upon pleasurable feelings.
Life provides us with overwhelming pleasure through each of our senses.
Take, for instance, the sense of sight: your eyes are agreeable and pleasurable.
So, too, is eye consciousness agreeable and pleasurable, and so are visual objects, eye contact, feelings about what we see, visual recognition, desire for visual things, thoughts of them, deliberations, fantasies, and so on.
Similarly agreeable and pleasurable sensations arise from the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Every single day you have opportunities to get involved in agreeable and pleasurable objects through your senses.
Yet you are not happy.
In his second truth, the Buddha asked us to recognize that our attachment to sensual pleasure is dangerous to our happiness.
He compared sensual pleasure to a bone with no meat thrown to a hungry dog.
Though the dog gnaws on the bone for a long time, the bone never satisfies his hunger.
On reflection you may find that you are like that, too.
No matter how much sensual pleasure you have, you’re still hungry for more.
The Buddha compared sensual pleasures to a razor-sharp sword with honey smeared on the blade.
To taste the honey, people are willing to risk great pain.
We can all think of examples of people who hurt or even kill themselves seeking pleasure.
There was a story in the newspaper a few years back about a worker who was repairing a roof when, looking down through a skylight, he caught sight of the woman of the house walking around in the nude.
To get a better view, he leaned so far over the skylight that it gave way; he tumbled into the house and was badly injured.
Alcohol, drugs, adventure travel, dangerous sports—to say nothing of careless sexual behavior—cause many people much suffering.
Moreover, sensual pleasures don’t last.
Like a dream, pleasures are fleeting.
They slip away from you quickly, leaving you nothing to hold on to but your feelings and memories.
Like borrowed goods, they are not yours to keep.
The more attached you are to a pleasure, the more it hurts when time, change, or circumstance inevitably snatches it away.
Desire arises from feelings of pleasure and pain.
When pleasure arises, there is a desire to cling to it and perpetuate it.
When pain arises, there is a desire to reject it or turn away from it.
Because of your attachment to pleasant feelings and your aversion to unpleasant feelings, you constantly seek experiences that perpetuate the pleasant or reject the unpleasant.
Once you have found something that accomplishes this goal, you become biased and prejudiced.
This state of mind makes people cling.
To protect or hold on to what they have, people are willing to lie, abuse or insult others, and even take up arms to defend what they believe is theirs.
Desire also leads to mental suffering.
Due to feelings arising from contact with what is pleasurable—sights, smells, sounds, tastes, touches, and ideas—people think and rationalize, theorize, philosophize, speculate, and conceptualize.
They come to hold wrong views and wrong beliefs.
Recalling past pleasant sensations, they concoct even more desirous thoughts, beliefs, and theories.
Some people become so obsessed with their desires that they hope to be reborn to enjoy all the pleasant things again.
Others, because of unpleasant experiences they have had, desire not to be reborn: “This is it,” they say.
“One life is enough.
I don’t need any more of this.
At bottom, desire comes out of ignorance—ignorance that nothing lasts and ignorance that desire creates discomfort.
When the senses contact something pleasurable, the ignorant mind develops the intention to grasp and hold on to it.
The reverse also occurs.
When the senses contact something unpleasant, the ignorant mind develops the intention to escape and avoid it.
Because of these intentions, people engage in unskillful actions of body, speech, and mind, despite the consequences.
Because of desire, people distort reality and avoid taking personal responsibility for their actions.
The Buddha’s teaching on causes and their results makes clear that accepting responsibility for our actions is the foundation for personal well-being and fulfillment.
Denying your shortcomings and blaming the world for your discontent keeps you mired in unhappiness.
Bad things happen to everyone.
As long as you blame your parents or society for your problems, you give yourself an excuse not to change.
The moment you accept responsibility for your situation, even though others may have contributed to it, you begin to move in a positive direction.
It seems to me that we distort reality and excuse ourselves from taking personal responsibility in at least three ways.
First, we think that our unhappiness is caused by the outside world.
As a result, we direct all of our energy and our mental capabilities outward.
We get engrossed and sometimes even obsessed in trying to straighten out the people around us, as if their perfection would bring us relief.
Or we try to straighten out society, assuming that correcting society’s ills will solve our own problems: “When hunger, war, and pollution are eliminated, then I’ll be happy.
The desire to improve society is, of course, commendable.
We see how dissatisfied people are, we feel compassion, and we act to alleviate their suffering.
But often we don’t recognize that while trying to correct others people’s problems, we forget or suppress our own.
Our excuse: there are so many social wrongs that need to be fixed, we have no time to improve ourselves.
In reality, we may lack the honesty and courage to examine our real intentions.
While people involved in social action may be very compassionate and service-minded, some of us fail to admit our real motivation.
We all know that helping the less fortunate can give us a sense of power that we would not get from working with people who are not dependent on us.
The desire for power is a basic instinct.
It takes much honesty to see how much of what we do for others springs from this desire.
Recognizing the intentions behind our actions can help us focus on the all-important task of putting our own house in order before we try to save others.
The second excuse we use to avoid accepting responsibility for our actions is to insist that there is no problem with us.
We focus on our own ends and pleasures and have little regard for how what we do affects others.
Deep inside, we may believe that the outside world is unimportant, in a certain way even imaginary.
If we could listen to our own thoughts, we’d hear ourselves say, “I alone exist, and only what I care about is important—nothing else matters.
We can all think of public figures who declare certain values while privately acting against those values.
These people focus on helping themselves.
Some who are a bit honest admit that they are driven by the desire for financial success, power, or popularity.
Still, they have found a way to avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions.
They fool themselves into thinking that the personal goal they pursue is more important than anything else.
They fool themselves into believing that if they reach their goal they’ll be happy, no matter who gets hurt along the way.
The third way we avoid our personal problems is simply running away from them.
We all do this.
Watching television or raiding the refrigerator for chocolate ice cream are typical ways to avoid honest self-reflection.
You lull your mind and body into comfort and relaxation, and then you go to bed.
Time passes.
Except for getting older and fatter, nothing changes.
The challenge is to have the courage to ask why.
At one time or another, we have all indulged in these kinds of escapes from responsibility, and they have given us some temporary solace, some very brief comfort.
But none offer a genuine or lasting solution to our problems.
Whether you try to change the world, ignore the world, or distract yourself from the world, you cannot avoid ultimate responsibility for your actions.
Life has its ups and downs, and we create them.
This vehicle of ours—our mind-body combination—is full of difficult moments.
The only thing that works, according to the Buddha’s teaching, is to find a way to improve the only instrument that has the power to make ourselves and the world happy.
That instrument is our own mind.
Understanding the Third Truth: The End of Dissatisfaction
The Buddha’s third truth is his promise that there is an end to dissatisfaction.
That end comes from our completely eradicating all attachment, all desire.
Yet it is hard for us to imagine at this point what total happiness might feel like.
What would it be like never to experience desire or hatred?
This very question came up among Buddha’s disciples.
One day the Venerable Sariputta, one of the Buddha’s two chief disciples and himself an enlightened teacher, was having a discussion with a group of monks.
They asked him, “Venerable Sir, this state of permanent happiness, which the Buddha calls nibbana [or nirvana], is said not to be experiential happiness.
How can something that is not experienced be called happiness?”
Sariputta answered, “That is why it is called happiness.” IV 3)
In other words, happiness consists of what is not experienced.
The third truth teaches us that happiness is wiping out all negative states of mind—all desire, all hatred, all ignorance.
When we at last succeed in putting out the internal fires that burn our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, then we experience total happiness, total peace.
It may be hard to imagine what such a state feels like, but the only way to find out is by following the path toward this goal.
Like many of us, the monks talking to Sariputta wanted to know right at the beginning of the path what its end is like.
This is like asking a young girl, “How does it feel when you give birth to a child?” The young girl has never given birth.
She has to grow and mature in order to have that experience.
She may be able to say something about childbirth from what she’s read or heard, but she cannot express the entire experience.
Even her mother might not be able to capture what it’s like to give birth.
She can describe her own experience, but listeners who have never given birth will still not be able to understand how a mother feels.
The permanent happiness of enlightenment is like this.
It can be understood only by those who have completed the preliminary work and gone through the experience themselves.
Suppose that same young girl goes to her father and asks, “Daddy, what is your relationship to Mommy?”
Perhaps, when she grows up and is ready to be married, her father says to her, “Long ago you asked me what my relationship with your mother was.
Do you want me to answer that question now?”
The daughter replies, “No, Daddy, I know the answer.
The daughter has matured in her understanding.
She knows the answer to the question herself.
If a worldly experience such as the relationship between a man and a woman is so difficult to explain, imagine how difficult it is to understand the permanent happiness of freedom from dissatisfaction!
At present, our mind is full of ideas, opinions, and views, many of them motivated by desire, hatred, or ignorance.
Trying to understand the bliss of permanent happiness before we have eliminated our negative states of mind is impossible.
All we can do is quote the similes, parables, and analogies told to us by those who have reached enlightenment and try to come to some inferential understanding.
Once a tortoise living among the fish and other sea creatures suddenly disappeared.
When he returned, the fish asked him questions about where he had been.
“I went to the land,” the tortoise told them.
They asked him, “What is the water there like?”
He replied, “There is no water on the land.
“How did you swim?”
“I didn’t swim.
When the tortoise tried to explain, the fish said, skeptically, “No water; no fish; you can’t swim; and you say you ‘walked.
’ How can this be?”
The tortoise answered, “You seem satisfied with your speculations.
Let me go back to the land.
” And with that, he disappeared.
Just as the fish could never conceive of the idea of land, a person who suffers from greed, hatred, and delusion cannot make sense of nibbana.
To understand, you must transcend all negative states of mind and experience enlightenment for yourself.
Until you do so, the nearest you can come to experiencing the happiness of enlightenment is the bliss you sometimes achieve when you have momentarily let go of your burden, when the mind is just “mind” with nothing else in it.
The inferential understanding you get at such times may be compared to being in the desert and feeling tired and thirsty.
You come upon a deep well with some water at the bottom but there is no bucket or rope.
You’re too weak to hoist up a bucketful anyway.
So although you can see the water, you can’t taste it, let alone drink any.
Similarly, when your mind is temporarily free of greed, hatred, and delusion, you can perceive the peace of nibbana, but you don’t necessarily have the tools to reach it.
Getting rid of greed is like finding the rope of generosity.
Freeing the mind from hatred is like attaching the rope to the bucket of loving-friendliness.
Strength in your hands is like wisdom, free of ignorance.
When you put these three together, you have the means to taste, at last, the bliss of nibbana.
The bliss of this state is indescribable.
Its single characteristic is peace.
It is not born, not created, not conditioned.
The best we can do is to say what this state does not have.
It does not have desire or attachment or grasping after things, people, and experiences.
It does not have hatred or aversion or anger or greed.
It does not have the fault of seeing things as permanent, as satisfactory, or as possessing an inherent self or soul.
People who are still under the delusion that they are enjoying life as it is here in this unsatisfactory world might hear this description and say, “Enlightenment does not sound like much fun.
I’m not sure I want to attain that state.
We would have to answer no.
One who remains attached to life, this endless existence, does not have the clarity of mind to want to attain the state of permanent bliss.
This person has not understood the Buddha’s first truth, that dissatisfaction is unavoidable, or his second truth, that to whatever degree we desire, to that degree we suffer.
Without Skillful Understanding of these essential points, it is impossible to understand the Buddha’s third truth—that dissatisfaction ends when we cease all attachment, all desire.
You might be wondering whether it is all right to have the desire to achieve enlightenment and escape the endless round of rebirth.
The answer is yes, this is very good desire—called “the desire to be desireless.
Understanding the Fourth Truth: The Path
The Buddha’s fourth truth is the path that leads to the end of dissatisfaction.
Its eight steps bring peace and happiness to those who follow them.
Later we’ll examine each step in detail, but let’s look at them quickly:
Step one: Skillful Understanding of the Buddha’s message requires that we understand skillful behavior in terms of cause and effect and the Four Noble Truths and how they fit into the overall scheme of the Buddha’s teachings.
Step two: Skillful Thinking introduces us to three positive thoughts—generosity or letting go, loving-friendliness, and compassion.
Step three: Skillful Speech explains how telling the truth and avoiding malicious talk, harsh language, and gossip can help us advance on the path.
Step four: Skillful Action lays out the principles for leading an ethical life—especially abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication.
Step five: Skillful Livelihood explains why choosing an appropriate job or profession is important to our spiritual practice and how we should approach questions of business ethics.
Step six: Skillful Effort lays out four steps we can take to motivate our practice—preventing negative states of mind, overcoming negative states of mind, cultivating positive states of mind, and maintaining positive states of mind.
Step seven: Skillful Mindfulness refers to the practice of mindfulness meditation—specifically, cultivating mindfulness of your body, feelings, mind, and thoughts.
Step eight: Skillful Concentration refers to four stages of deep absorption we can reach in meditation.
These eight steps are not merely an interesting list of ideas taught by the Buddha.
They are your best hope for enlightenment.
If the eight steps are something you have just skimmed through quickly and then set aside, you have missed their potential.
No other teaching is more profound and more central to the Buddha’s message.
In fact, these eight steps are the Buddha’s message.
These eight steps are often represented as a wheel—the wheel of clarity, as opposed to the wheel of endless birth, death, and rebirth.
Clarity stops the cycle of repeated births and deaths.
The spokes on the wheel of clarity are the eight steps of the Buddha’s path.
Its hub is the combination of compassion and wisdom.
By contrast, the spokes of the wheel of endless birth, death, and rebirth are the many lives we have led and will lead in the realms of suffering.
The hub of this wheel is the combination of desire, hatred, and ignorance.
Both wheels are always in motion.
We see all around us the endless cycle of birth and death.
Plants, animals, people are always being born and dying.
It’s harder to see the motion of the wheel of clarity, yet it is there.
All around us, people are practicing the Buddha’s path to happiness.
This wheel is in motion because spiritual practice is dynamic, always active and moving.
The circular shape of both wheels symbolizes perfection.
Whereas the circular shape of the wheel of clarity symbolizes that the Eightfold Path is complete and perfect.
To liberate yourself from dissatisfaction, you should put into practice every aspect of the wheel of clarity.
Simply reading about the eight steps of the wheel will not help you make your life happy.
If you try to make a bicycle wheel stand upright, it will fall over.
However, if you set the wheel spinning by riding the bicycle, the wheel will stand upright as long as the motion lasts.
To benefit you, the wheel of clarity also needs to be put in motion through daily practice.
As an example of how you might practice the first step—Skillful Understanding of the Four Noble Truths—imagine that while sitting on your cushion one morning you get a pain in your leg.
Instead of just noticing the arising and passing away of the sensation, on this occasion you become unhappy about the pain, and your unhappiness makes the pain worse.
If your mindfulness had been skillful, this problem would not have happened, but now you are stuck.
What should you do?
You can overcome the suffering caused by this pain by using the Buddha’s eight steps.
Here is an opportunity to see the Four Noble Truths in action.
It is not so neat and tidy as that.
If you are cooking in a kitchen where all the pots are hung according to size and all the utensils neatly arranged in some kind of logical order, you don’t use these implements in the order in which they are arranged.
Instead, you grab whatever spoon or pot you need at the moment.
Similarly, incorporating the eight steps into your daily life requires that you select and use whatever step is needed.
First you simply become mindful of the pain and your resistance to it.
Thus you make use of Skillful Mindfulness, the seventh step of the path.
With mindfulness, you become aware that “this is suffering.
” When you thus see the truth of your suffering, you are seeing the First Noble Truth.
It becomes real to you, and you begin working with Skillful Understanding, which is the first step of the path.
With mindful attention, you will likely notice that the more you resist the pain, the worse it feels.
So you make an effort to overcome your aversion.
This involves Skillful Effort, the sixth step.
You let go of aversion by relaxing and cultivating a friendly attitude.
You may, for example, realize that the pain in your leg is as worthy of loving-friendliness as any other bodily sensation.
In this way, you develop an aspect of Skillful Thinking, the second step.
Then you may notice that your suffering arises not just because of aversion but because you want to feel better.
You may think, for example, “If only I could have a peaceful sitting, without this pain!” Seeing the connection between your desire and your suffering brings direct insight into the Second Noble Truth, the truth that desire causes suffering.
Now you have developed further Skillful Understanding.
As you sit with the awareness of the Second Noble Truth, becoming increasingly mindful of the connection between your desire and your suffering, you also further develop Skillful Mindfulness.
Because you see so clearly how desire leads to suffering, determination arises to do something about desire.
Rousing energy, you again apply Skillful Effort, this time, in order to let go of your craving and clinging to pleasant feeling.
The thought of letting go, also known as renunciation, is another aspect of Skillful Thinking.
Perhaps you initially reacted to the pain with a sense of disappointment and frustration.
If self-blame or other uncompassionate thoughts directed toward yourself have arisen, you now make a Skillful Effort to let go of them.
In doing so, you again exercise Skillful Thinking.
Please notice that if you make excessive effort, it will create more pain and tension.
With mindfulness, however, you see that problem.
Then the step of Skillful Thinking again becomes useful, this time to cool your mind with thoughts of loving-friendliness toward yourself.
Such successes in cultivating Skillful Understanding, Thinking, Effort, and Mindfulness let your mind settle down.
The mind becomes more concentrated; this is an expression of the eighth step of the path, Skillful Concentration.
When there is good concentration, the physical and mental pain goes away.
As the pain disappears you feel joyful, tranquil, peaceful, and happy.
These qualities, in turn, lead to even deeper concentration.
Deeper concentration causes mindfulness to strengthen, and you continue to examine your experiences.
You see that the pain disappeared because you let go of your desire for pleasurable sensations.
Then your Skillful Understanding increases as the logic and power of the Third Noble Truth become clear: with the ending of desire comes the ending of suffering.
You may notice that in this example we have not mentioned the “morality” aspects of the path: Skillful Speech, Skillful Action, and Skillful Livelihood .
But they too play a role, for they are key aspects of a good life.
Immorality unsettles the mind, making meditation difficult even in comfortable circumstances.
You need a good moral foundation before you can remain focused and maintain strong determination in the face of physical or mental pain.
Thus, when you correctly apply the steps of the Buddha’s path, you find in them the way to let go of suffering.
In doing so, you witness the last of the Four Noble Truths, the truth that the way to end suffering is to follow the Eightfold Path.
Now you have touched upon all four basic aspects of Skillful Understanding.
By seeing for yourself how the Four Noble Truths function in this kind of situation, you glimpse how they work in your life generally.
Thus the wheel of clarity spins on.
The following points will help you gain happiness through Skillful Understanding:
Skillful Understanding leads us to act with a comprehension of cause and effect and the Four Noble Truths.
In accordance with the principle of kamma , acting in skillful ways causes happy results and acting in unskillful ways causes unhappy results.
Any action that comes from a mind under the influence of greed, hatred, or delusion leads to suffering and is thus unskillful or wrong.
Any action that comes from a mind not under the influence of greed, hatred, or delusion brings happiness and is thus skillful or right.
The Four Noble Truths proclaim dissatisfaction, its origin, its cessation, and the Eightfold Path that leads to the cessation of dissatisfaction.
Facing the truth of dissatisfaction helps us recognize true happiness.
Birth, old age, sickness, and death; separation from what we love and association with what we hate; not getting what we want and getting what we don’t want—these are all dissatisfaction.
Dissatisfaction arises when we fail to accept the impermanent, inherently unsatisfying, and selfless nature of all phenomena.
Desire is the underlying cause of dissatisfaction.
To the degree we have desire, to that degree we suffer.
We must take responsibility for our desire and the intentional actions it motivates.
When we take responsibility for the results of our intentional actions, we change our behavior.
There is an end to dissatisfaction.
The eight steps of the Buddha’s path to happiness show us the way to end dissatisfaction and achieve total happiness.
Mindfulness can help us understand the Four Noble Truths and the eight steps of the path to happiness.
STEP 2 Skillful Thinking
I T’S NO MYSTERY that thinking can make us happy or miserable.
Let’s say you’re sitting under a tree one fine spring day.
Maybe you’re remembering another spring day several years back when you were feeling terrible.
You had just lost your job, or failed an exam, or your cat had wandered off.
That memory turns into a worry.
Soon you feel your life is in shambles, but all this while you’ve been sitting under the tree!
Fantasies, fears, and other kinds of obsessional thinking are a big problem for us.
We all tend to lock into unhealthy thought patterns—grooves we have worn into our consciousness that keep us circling in familiar tracks leading to unhappiness.
The second step of the Buddha’s path offers us an escape from this pattern, a way of redirecting our thoughts in positive and helpful directions.
When we begin to understand things rightly—through mindfulness of the key points of the first step of the path—our mind naturally flows into Skillful Thinking.
Thinking here refers not only to thoughts but to any intentional mind state.
As we come to understand that desire is the cause of dissatisfaction, we see that thoughts connected to attachment and aversion always lead to unhappiness.
Skillful Thinking consists of abandoning negative thoughts, such as grasping, hatred, and cruelty, and replacing them with wholesome thoughts, such as letting go, loving-friendliness, and compassion.
These skillful thoughts work as antidotes to obsession and worry and move us along on the path toward permanent happiness.
Letting go is the opposite of desire or attachment.
Think of it as generosity in the highest sense.
Along the Buddha’s path, we will have the opportunity to give away or let go of everything that holds us back from our goal of the highest happiness—possessions, people, beliefs and opinions, even our attachment to our own mind and body.
When people hear this, they sometimes start to worry.
They think that to follow the Buddha’s teachings they have to give everything away and join a monastery.
Though becoming a monk or a nun is indeed one way of practicing generosity, most people can let go in the midst of busy, family-centered lives.
What we need to reject is not the things we have, or our family and friends, but rather our mistaken sense that these are our possessions.
We need to let go of our habit of clinging to the people and the material things in our lives and to our ideas, beliefs, and opinions.
Material Generosity
Letting go is a gradual process.
Before we actually give anything away, we have to cultivate the thought of generosity.
We do this by considering carefully what generosity means and by looking at the pitfalls and advantages of practicing it.
A good place to begin is with the easiest type of generosity, giving away material things.
Notice first of all how our mind tricks us into avoiding the thought of generosity.
We tell ourselves that in order to be generous, we first must have a lot to give.
“Just wait until I get rich,” we say, “then I’ll build shelters for the homeless and hospitals and beautiful meditation centers.
Think of all the people I’ll be able to help!” So we collect, accumulate, and invest a little bit here and there.
As our investments grow, we get busier and busier taking care of them, and more and more attached to what we have.
Somehow there doesn’t seem to be any time to practice generosity.
Another trick the mind plays is attaching an ulterior motive to our generosity.
Giving someone a gift, we discover, makes us feel good.
Sometimes we enjoy the experience of giving a gift even more than the recipient enjoys getting it.
Giving makes us feel proud.
Our ego is pleased by how beautiful or expensive the gift is, by the message it carries about our good taste or our sense of style.
Moreover, we may secretly feel that the person who gets the gift now has an obligation to us.
We may even be using our excessive generosity to demean the recipient.
When we give something away, some element of seeking enjoyment is generally present.
Giving so that we feel good, or so that someone will think well of us or owe us a favor, corrupts our generosity.
Another kind of less-than-skillful giving occurs when we make a gift to avoid painful feelings.
For example, a family may donate money so that a park or public building is named after a lost loved one.
The gift may be a way of transferring their grasping from the loved one to the idea of a permanent monument.
True generosity lets go not only of wealth or possessions but of clinging to a person who has died and to feelings of sorrow or anger.
A wealthy couple I knew once gave away everything they owned after the death of their only child.
Though they made a show of giving their money to charity, they really gave out of anger.
They wanted to blunt the feeling of pain over losing their child by punishing themselves.
Monasteries and charities may benefit greatly from such gifts, but the giver does not fully benefit.
On the other hand, people may make such gifts in order to transform their grief into generous, loving, friendly thoughts.
This generosity is skillful and brings healing.
The best giving occurs when we have no expectations of any return, not even a thank-you.
We give while knowing that we already have in our hearts everything we need to be happy.
Such giving is motivated by a sense of fullness, not loss.
Giving anonymously, and without knowing the recipient, is a wonderful way to be generous.
Giving quietly, without fanfare, lessens our desire and reduces our attachments to the things we have.
The highest form of material giving happens when we respond to others’ needs at the risk of our own lives.
On television news I once saw a man do this after there had been a terrible accident.
On a cold winter day in 1983 an airplane leaving Washington, D.C.
, for Florida never managed to gain altitude because of ice on the wings.
It crashed into the Fourteenth Street bridge.
Most on board were killed.
Many fell to the ice-covered Potomac River, smashing through the ice into freezing water.
At one spot where people were crawling out of the water onto the broken ice, a rescue helicopter approached and dropped a cable within reach of a man.
But instead of grasping it and saving his life, he helped a woman grab the line.
She was flown to safety.
The helicopter returned, and, even though the man was freezing, he again passed the cable to a woman, and she too was saved.
When the helicopter returned a third time, this man had died from the cold.
But we do not need an opportunity to act heroically, nor do we need great wealth, to practice generosity.
All we need is the willingness to give of ourselves, even in some small way.
With that thought we can, for example, spend time with people, helping them to overcome their loneliness.
Better yet, we can help them to overcome dissatisfaction by sharing with them what we have learned of the Buddha’s path and what we know about the practice of mindfulness and meditation.
Such sharing excels all other gifts.
Clinging to People, Experiences, and Beliefs
As we are coming to discover, pain arises from clinging to anything—form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness.
Letting go of our tendency to cling to people, experiences, and beliefs is more difficult than giving away material things, but it is even more important to our ultimate happiness.
Clinging to bodily form has two aspects.
Most obviously, we cling to other people in our lives.
Clinging is not the same as loving.
It is not the same as caring for someone’s welfare and wanting that person to be happy.
It is, rather, a jealous or obsessive possessiveness that seeks to own another person.
We can all think of examples of husbands and wives who try to possess each other, or of friends who are so bossy and controlling that they strangle the friendship.
Practicing generosity in human relationships means trusting another person and allowing him or her to enjoy space and freedom and dignity.
However, even good relationships can have an element of clinging.
All happy married couples hope that their marriage will last.
An element of fear is always there: “He will leave.” “She will die.”
It may be painful to think of this, but we must remember that every marriage, no matter how happy, ends in separation.
A more subtle kind of clinging to the body is our attachment to our physical form and to our belief that we are in control of it.
No matter how healthy and strong our body is now, we know that it will deteriorate with age and become weak and sick.
Nor can we control the stream of thoughts entering our minds.
At the bottom of our holding on to these things is terror.
With time, no matter how tightly we hold on, everything in this world shifts and changes.
The images we hold so tightly will shatter like glass.
Then how we suffer!
Possessing, clinging, or holding on to anything makes life more painful.
Using a material possession without clinging helps us avoid heartbreak when it is lost, broken, or stolen.
Also, holding on to our families and friends or to our sense of personal identity—my title or occupation, my family background, my position in the world—leads to suffering when, as is inevitable, these concepts dissolve.
When we do not cling, our mind is always at peace.
This relaxed attitude consoles us, comforts us, and reduces our tension, anxiety, worry, and fear.
Developing an attitude of not clinging requires, at first, that we spend a certain amount of time alone.
Many of us cling to the experience of being with others out of fear of being lonely.
But aloneness is not loneliness.
Rather, it is singleness that creates space for us to think, reflect, meditate, and free the mind from noise and attachment.
As our greed, hatred, and delusion diminish through our solitary practice of mindfulness and meditation, we strengthen our ability to be with others without clinging.
When the mind is at peace, we can be in company with many people without attachment and the suffering it brings.
The Buddha walked many miles every day with thousands of monks, nuns, and laypeople around him.
Some came to live with him.
Some came to ask him questions.
The Buddha carried his aloneness within him, even in a crowd.
His attitude of nonattachment was total.
Occasionally, some of the monks, nuns, or laypeople who followed the Buddha spent time alone in the forests perfecting their practice of nonattachment.
But they did not live in the forest forever.
As they let go of attachment, they learned to live with other people while maintaining a solid, well-grounded state of mind.
That state of mind is called renunciation.
Renunciation is not only for monks and nuns but for anyone who loves solitude or who longs to live without bondage.
All renounced people, even monks and nuns, live with others some of the time.
Mindfulness of Skillful Thinking helps us create a stable psychological state so that we are not bothered by the changing conditions of our physical environment or by other people.
Like the Buddha, we learn to carry our renunciation within ourselves.
Letting go of clinging also requires that we renounce attachment to our beliefs, opinions, and ideas.
This is difficult.
We tend to derive our sense of personal identity—to define ourselves—by what we think about various issues.
Often we get so caught up in this identification that we feel personally attacked when someone criticizes the political candidate we are supporting or our opinion about some question of public policy.
Yet our ideals, opinions, or views are also subject to the law of impermanence.
Think back to what you believed at age sixteen or at age thirty, and you’ll see just how changeable your personal beliefs are.
On a larger scale, throughout history people all over the world have gone to war in the name of their cherished opinions or beliefs.
The amount of killing we humans do to protect our material possessions is insignificant as compared to the killing we do to protect unwholesome beliefs, such as racial or religious bigotry.
Bring to mind the cherished beliefs that have led to war and ask whether protecting them was worth war’s terrible cost.
Letting go of unwholesome thoughts, words, and deeds creates the space for us to cultivate wholesome thoughts such as loving-friendliness, appreciative joy, nonviolence, and equanimity.
But we should not be attached even to these wholesome thoughts.
Letting go requires us to go beyond good and evil.
In the end, the Buddha told us, even his teachings must be cast aside: “These teachings are like a raft, to be abandoned once you have crossed the flood.
Since you should abandon even good states of mind generated by these teachings, how much more so should you abandon bad states of mind!”
I am not suggesting that you will be able to give up your clinging all of a sudden or become liberated overnight.
Seeking “instant enlightenment” can be just a big ego trip.
As I travel and teach, sometimes people approach me and inform me that they have quickly reached enlightenment.
I respond by quoting the Buddha’s description of the attributes of someone who has attained stages of enlightenment.
Since the people speaking to me do not have these attributes, they sometimes become very disappointed or even angry with me because my response does not please their egos.
Attachment is built into our psyches and strengthened over many lifetimes.
It is impossible to let it go quickly or easily.
We do not have to wait lifetimes to make a start, however.
With proper understanding, patience, effort, and mindfulness, we can begin to free ourselves from our bondage and even attain full enlightenment in this lifetime.
To achieve happiness, we must start today to develop the skillful thought of letting go of attachment and replacing it with open-minded generosity, flexibility, and detachment.
Dealing with Fear
When we begin to practice mindfulness of letting go, we often stumble on fear.
Fear arises because of an insecure, emotional, or greedy attachment to ideas, concepts, feelings, or physical objects, including our own body.
It can also be caused by coming into contact with something that we do not understand or whose outcome is uncertain.
Say, for example, that you have recently been told that you have cancer.
You are scheduled to have surgery, after which your doctors will decide whether more treatment is needed.
Now you are trying to meditate.
So many thoughts run through your mind.
The thoughts and feelings build on each other, and you become increasingly agitated, upset, and very afraid.
As you sit in meditation, watch as each mental state arises.
If many thoughts and feelings come up at once, try to distinguish between them: “What is going to happen to me?”—fear.
“How dare the nurse say that to me!”—anger.
“I hate needles!”—aversion.
“How many people survive this thing?”—fear.
As you begin to sort them out, your thoughts and feelings become more manageable.
You stop being so caught up in the frightening stories that the mind is conjuring up, and you can start to reason with yourself.
You can bring to mind consoling thoughts—the skill and compassion of your doctors and nurses, the recent advances in treatment, the people you know who are living full lives despite a diagnosis like yours.
As you counter the ideas that have been feeding your fear, you are practicing mindfulness in action.
You can see how the mind plays games with itself, using thoughts to create fear, and fear to create more thoughts.
This may also be a good time for self-reflection.
You might examine your past behavior for times when fear caused you to act in unskillful ways.
You can resolve to remain mindful and not allow fear to cause you to act in such ways in the future.
Now that your mind is calm and clear, you can go back to meditating on the breath or other meditation object.
Accept the fact that fearful thoughts will arise in your meditation from time to time.
With the experience you have gained, you can ignore their specific content and just witness what happens to all thoughts and feelings.
You see that every mental object rises and peaks.
No matter how intense it is, if you stay with it—as if it were a friend who wants to hold your hand while walking through a difficult experience—you will also see every mental object fall away.
Now that you have noticed the thinking process itself, you gain confidence that no matter how frightening a train of thought may be at the time, it eventually comes to an end.
Once you have managed to sit with strong fear completely, you will no longer see fear the same way.
You’ll know that fear is just a natural mind state that comes and goes.
It has no substance and cannot hurt you.
Your attitude around fear begins to soften.
You know that you can observe and let go of whatever arises.
As you lose the fear of fear, you gain a sense of freedom.
The same strategy works with other unpleasant states of mind, including memories, imaginings, daydreams, or worries about problems you are facing.
Sometimes you may be afraid of unpleasant memories because you think that you may not be able to handle them.
But now you know that you can handle any state of mind that you might ordinarily want to repress.
Your practice of mindfulness has taught you that it is not the mental states themselves that make you uncomfortable, but your attitude toward them.
Then you try to reject the unpleasant ones as if they were foreign bodies.
But you cannot really reject any of them, because they were not yours in the first place.
Your best response is to maintain a steady practice of observing your mind, without reacting with clinging or aversion to anything that comes up, but skillfully working to free the mind from all unwholesome states.
As you let go of negative states of mind, you create the space in your mind for the cultivation of positive thoughts.
Skillful Thinking means that we replace angry or hostile thoughts with thoughts of loving-friendliness.
Loving-friendliness, or metta , is a natural capacity.
It is a warm wash of fellow-feeling, a sense of interconnectedness with all beings.
Because we wish for peace, happiness, and joy for ourselves, we know that all beings must wish for these qualities.
Loving-friendliness radiates to the whole world the wish that all beings enjoy a comfortable life with harmony, mutual appreciation, and appropriate abundance.
Though we all have the seed of loving-friendliness within us, we must make the effort to cultivate it.
When we are rigid, uptight, tense, anxious, full of worries and fears, our natural capacity for loving-friendliness cannot flourish.
To nurture the seed of loving-friendliness, we must learn to relax.
In a peaceful state of mind, such as we get from mindfulness meditation, we can forget our past differences with others and forgive their faults, weaknesses, and offenses.
Then loving-friendliness naturally grows within us.
As is the case with generosity, loving-friendliness begins with a thought.
Typically, our minds are full of views, opinions, beliefs, ideas.
We have been conditioned by our culture, traditions, education, associations, and experiences.
From these mental conditions we have developed prejudices and judgments.
These rigid ideas stifle our natural loving-friendliness.
Yet, within this tangle of confused thinking, the idea of our friendly interconnection with others does come up occasionally.
We catch a glimpse of it as we might glimpse a tree during a flash of lightning.
As we learn to relax and let go of negativity, we begin to recognize our biases and not let them dominate our minds.
Then the thought of loving-friendliness begins to shine, showing its true strength and beauty.
The loving-friendliness that we wish to cultivate is not love as we ordinarily understand it.
When you say you love so-and-so, what you conceive in your mind is generally an emotion conditioned by the behavior or qualities of that person.
Perhaps you admire the person’s appearance, manner, ideas, voice, or attitude.
Should these conditions change, or your tastes, whims, and fancies change, what you call love might change as well.
In extreme cases, your love might even turn to hate.
This love-hate duality pervades all our ordinary feelings of affection.
You love one person and hate another.
Or you love now and hate later.
Or you love whenever you feel like it and hate whenever you feel like it.
Or you love when everything is smooth and rosy and hate when anything goes wrong.
If your love changes from time to time, place to place, and situation to situation in this fashion, then what you call love is not the skillful thought of loving-friendliness.
It may be erotic lust, greed for material security, desire to feel loved, or some other form of greed in disguise.
True loving-friendliness has no ulterior motive.
It never changes into hate as circumstances change.
It never makes you angry if you do not get favors in return.
Loving-friendliness motivates you to behave kindly to all beings at all times and to speak gently in their presence and in their absence.
When fully matured, your net of loving-friendliness embraces everything in the universe without exception.
It has no limitations, no boundaries.
Your thought of loving-friendliness includes not only all beings as they are at this moment but also your wish that all of them, without any discrimination or favoritism, will be happy in the limitless future.
Let me tell you a story of the powerful, far-reaching effects that an act of loving-friendliness can have:
In a little house in India lived an old lady and her young daughter.
Nearby in a hut lived a meditating monk.
Out of respect, the old lady called the monk her son and asked her daughter to treat him as her brother.
Every morning the monk went to the village to collect cooked food for his midday meal.
He never forgot to stop at the little house to get the small quantity of food that old lady and her daughter offered him with great affection and devotion.
Every afternoon he returned to the village to see his supporters and encourage them to practice meditation and live peaceful lives.
One afternoon on his way to the village, the monk overheard a conversation between the old lady and her daughter.
The old lady told her daughter, “Darling, tomorrow your brother will come to our house on his alms round.
Here is ghee; here is honey; here is rice; here are spices; here are vegetables.
Make sure that you prepare a delicious meal for him.
The daughter asked the mother, “Where will you go tomorrow?”
“I plan to spend the day in the forest meditating by myself.
“But what will you eat?”
“I will make a little rice soup from today’s leftover rice.
That is enough for me.
But make sure that you make a good meal for your brother and offer it to him when he comes to our house.
Hearing this conversation, the monk thought, “This old lady loves and respects me so much that she ordered her daughter to make a delicious meal for me when she herself is going to eat a simple rice soup made out of stale rice.
I don’t deserve that delicious meal until I attain full enlightenment.
I must make myself worthy of her loving gift.
This is the time for me to make unremitting effort to liberate myself from all negative states of mind.
The monk hung up his upper robe.
He decided not go to the village again to collect food until he attained full liberation of mind.
He sat down on his meditation seat making the following resolution: “Let my blood dry up.
Let my flesh wither.
Let this body be reduced to a skeleton.
I shall not get up from this seat without attaining the final stage of liberation.
Just before the time came for him to go on his alms round, he attained his goal.
Then the monk put on his robes and went to the village taking his alms bowl.
When he visited the little house, the daughter of the old lady offered him the delicious meal.
The young lady waited anxiously for her mother to return home from her day’s meditation.
That evening, as soon as the mother arrived home, the daughter ran up to her and said, “Mother I have never seen our monk so serene, so composed, so radiant, calm, so beautiful.
“My dear, he must have attained true freedom, liberation from negative states of mind.
We are very fortunate to have such a monk so close to our home.
But if we really honor him, we must follow in his footsteps.
From now on, let us meditate more vigorously so that we might achieve the same state.
So both mother and daughter meditated until they, too, reached higher stages of attainment.
Many villagers followed their example and attained stages of enlightenment.
Such was the far-reaching effect of the loving-friendliness of an old lady.
Loving Your Enemies
Some people wonder how they can extend the feeling of loving-friendliness toward their enemies.
They wonder how they can say sincerely, “May my enemies be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no difficulties or problems come to them.
This question arises from mistaken thinking.
A person whose mind is filled with problems may behave in a way that offends or harms us.
We call that person an enemy.
But in actuality, there is no such person as an enemy.
It is the person’s negative state of mind that is causing us problems.
Mindfulness shows us that states of mind are not permanent.
They are temporary, correctable, adjustable.
In practical terms, the best thing I can do to assure my own peace and happiness is to help my enemies overcome their problems.
If all my enemies were free of pain, dissatisfaction, affliction, neurosis, paranoia, tension, and anxiety, they would no longer have reason to be my enemies.
Once free of negativity, an enemy is just like anybody else—a wonderful human being.
We can practice loving-friendliness on anyone—parents, teachers, relatives, friends, unfriendly people, indifferent people, people who cause us problems.
We do not have to know or be close to people to practice loving-friendliness toward them.
In fact, sometimes it’s easier not to know people.
We can look at the many, many beings in the universe as if they were specks of light in space and wish them all to be happy and at peace.
Though merely wishing may not make this so, cultivating the hope that others might enjoy loving-friendliness is a skillful thought that fills our own minds with contentment and joy.
If everyone holds the thought that everyone else enjoys loving-friendliness, we will have peace on earth.
Say there are six billion people in the world, and each one cultivates this wish.
Every action comes from thinking.
If the thought is impure, the actions that follow from that thought will be impure and harmful.
The opposite is also true.
As the Buddha told us, the pure thought of loving-friendliness is more powerful than hatred, more powerful than weapons.
Weapons destroy.
Loving-friendliness helps beings live in peace and harmony.
Which do you think is more lasting and more powerful?
Dealing with Anger
The main obstacle to loving-friendliness is anger.
When anger and hatred consume us, there is no room in our minds for friendly feelings toward ourselves or toward others, no space for relaxation or peace.
We each react to anger in our own way.
Others hold on to their anger for a long time, even months or years.
They feel that their anger makes them very special, very righteous.
Still others lash out physically against those who anger them.
Whatever your style, you can be sure of one thing: Your anger ultimately hurts you more than it hurts the person you’re angry with.
The emotional toll of anger is equally grim.
To put it bluntly, anger makes us feel miserable.
Anger also disrupts our relationships.
No one wants to associate with someone in the grip of anger.
An angry person can be irrational, even dangerous.
Moreover, anger often does no damage to the person toward whom it is directed.
In most cases, your anger with someone who insulted you harms that person not at all.
Rather, it’s you who are red in the face, you who are shouting and making a scene, you who look ridiculous and feel miserable.
Your adversary may even find your anger entertaining.
An attitude of habitual ill will and resentment can adversely affect your health, your relationships, your livelihood, your future.
You yourself may even experience the terrible things you wished upon your adversary.
In working with anger, we must first determine to restrain ourselves from acting on angry impulses.
Whenever I think about restraint, I remember my uncle’s elephant.
When I was a little boy, my uncle had a big, beautiful elephant.
My friends and I used to like to tease this animal.
We would throw stones at her until she became angry with us.
The elephant was so big, she could have crushed us if she had wanted to.
What she did instead was remarkable.
One time when we threw stones at her, the elephant used her trunk to grab a stick about the size of a pencil and to spank us with this little stick.
She showed great self-restraint, doing only what was needed to make us respect her.
For a few days after that, the elephant held a grudge against us and would not let us ride her.
My uncle told us to take her to the big creek, where we scrubbed her skin with coconut shells while she relaxed and enjoyed the cool water.
After that, she completely let go of her anger toward us.
Now I tell my students, when you feel justified in reacting violently out of anger, remember the moderate response of my uncle’s big, gentle elephant.
Another way of dealing with anger is to reflect on its results.
We know very well that when we are angry, we do not see the truth clearly.
As a result, we may commit many unwholesome actions.
As we have learned, our past intentional actions are the only thing we really own.
Our future life is determined by our intentional actions today, just as our present life is heir to our previous intentional behavior.
Intentional actions committed under the influence of anger cannot lead to a happy future.
The best antidote to feelings of anger is patience.
Patience does not mean letting others walk all over you.
Patience means buying time with mindfulness so that you can act rightly.
When we react to provocation with patience, we speak the truth at the right time and in the right tone.
We use soft, kind, and appropriate words as if we were speaking to a child or a dear friend to prevent him from doing something harmful to himself or others.
Though you may raise your voice, this does not mean that you are angry.
Rather, you are being skillful in protecting someone you care about.
A famous story illustrates the Buddha’s patience and resourcefulness when confronted by an angry person:
Once there was a Brahmin, a person of high rank and authority.
This Brahmin had a habit of getting angry, even for no reason.
He quarreled with everyone.
If someone else was wronged and did not get angry, the Brahmin would get angry at that person for not being angry.
The Brahmin had heard that the Buddha never got angry.
One day he went to the Buddha and abused him with insults.
The Buddha listened compassionately and patiently.
Then he asked the Brahmin, “Do you have any family or friends or relatives?”
“Yes, I have many relatives and friends,” the Brahmin replied.
“Do you visit them periodically?” the Buddha asked.
“Do you carry gifts for them when you visit them?”
I never go to see them without a gift,” said the Brahmin.
The Buddha asked, “When you give gifts to them, suppose they do not accept them.
What would you do with these gifts?”
“I would take them home and enjoy them with my family,” answered the Brahmin.
Then the Buddha said, “Similarly, friend, you gave me a gift.
I do not accept it.
It is all yours.
Take it home and enjoy it with your family.
Finally, to overcome anger you can consider the benefits of loving-friendliness.
According to the Buddha, when you practice loving-friendliness, you “sleep in comfort, wake up in comfort, and dream sweet dreams.
You are dear to human beings and to nonhuman beings.
Deities guard you.
You concentrate easily.
Your face is serene.
Aren’t these prospects more pleasant than the misery, poor health, and ill will we get as a result of anger?
As your awareness of your mental states increases, you will recognize more and more quickly when you are becoming angry.
Then, as soon as angry thoughts arise, you can begin to apply the antidotes of patience and mindfulness.
You should also take every opportunity to make restitution for your angry actions.
If you said or did something to someone in anger, as soon as that moment has passed, you should consider going to this person to apologize, even if you think the other person was wrong or acted worse than you did.
Spending a few minutes apologizing to someone you offended produces marvelous and immediate relief for both of you.
In the same spirit, if you see that someone is angry with you, you can approach this person and talk in a relaxed way to try to find the cause of the anger.
You might say: “I am sorry you’re angry with me.
I’m not angry with you at all.
Perhaps we can work this out as friends.
” You might also give a gift to the person you think is angry with you.
A gift tames the untamed and makes friends of foes.
A gift can convert angry speech into kind words and harshness into gentleness.
Here are some practical steps you can take to overcome anger:
Become aware of your anger as soon as possible.
Be mindful of your anger and feel its strength.
Remember that a quick temper is extremely dangerous.
Bring to mind anger’s miserable consequences.
Practice restraint.
Realize that anger and its causes are impermanent.
Recall the example of the Buddha’s patience with the Brahmin.
Change your attitude by becoming helpful and kind.
Change the atmosphere between you and a person with whom you are angry by offering a gift or other favor.
Remember the advantages of practicing loving-friendliness.
Remember we all will die one day, and we don’t want to die with anger.
Compassion is the third skillful thought the Buddha encouraged us to cultivate.
Compassion is a melting of the heart at the thought of another’s suffering.
It is a spontaneous, wholesome reaction, coupled with a wish to alleviate another’s pain.
Compassion requires an object.
In order to cultivate compassion, you must reflect on the suffering you have personally experienced, notice the suffering of others, and make the intuitive connection between your own painful experiences and theirs.
Suppose, for example, you hear of a child being beaten or abused.
You open your mind to this child’s suffering by perhaps recalling the pain you felt in your heart when you were mistreated.
Or, when someone is ill, you reflect on how unpleasant and painful it is to suffer from sickness, and you wish that no one else suffer similar pain and anxiety.
Or you recall the heartbreak of separating from someone you love.
This memory leads to compassion for anyone separated from a loved one by death, distance, or rejection, and to the wish that no one need go through such pain.
Compassion and loving-friendliness are mutually supportive.
When you are full of loving-friendliness, your heart is open and your mind is clear enough to see the suffering of others.
Say, for instance, that someone treats you in a snobbish or disdainful way.
An attitude of loving-friendliness helps you to recognize that this harsh behavior must arise from some problem or inner hurt this person is experiencing.
Since you also have suffered problems in your life, your compassion arises, and you think to yourself, “This person must be suffering.
I may even aggravate this person’s problem.”
You are confident that if you continue to act in a loving and friendly way, this person will benefit, perhaps immediately and, if not, eventually.
Perhaps at some later time, this person will admire how you remained loving in spite of provocation and begin to imitate this friendly way of dealing with others.
The compassion of those who walk the Buddha’s path is extraordinary, as in this Mahayana legend:
Once there was a monk practicing meditation on compassion who wished to gain enough merit to see Metteyya, the Buddha of Loving-Friendliness.
The monk’s practice had so softened his heart that he would not hurt any living being.
One day, he saw a dog lying by the side of the road groaning in pain.
A gaping wound on the poor animal was filled with maggots.
This monk knelt down in front of the dog.
His first thought was to remove the maggots from the dog’s wound.
But then he thought, “If I use a stick to remove the worms, I may hurt them.
If I use my fingers, I may crush them, because they are very delicate creatures.
And if I put them down on the ground, someone may step on them.
Then he knew what he must do.
He cut a piece of flesh from his own thigh and put it on the ground.
Then he knelt down and stretched out his tongue to remove the maggots from the dog’s wound and place them on his own flesh.
As he did so, the dog disappeared.
In its place was Metteyya, the Buddha of Loving-Friendliness.
Every day we have many opportunities to practice compassion, yet we often find it difficult.
To avoid it, we move away, close down, make ourselves tight and rigid.
Mindfulness practice helps us to relax and to soften into whatever life presents.
When we allow our minds to become gentle and our hearts to open, the wellspring of our compassion can flow freely.
Practicing compassion for the people in our life is challenging to be sure, but it is critical to our happiness, now and in the future.
We need compassion for ourselves as well.
Compassion for Ourselves
Some of you may wonder why you have to practice compassion toward yourself.
“Caring for myself is selfish,” you may say.
“My needs are not important.
True spiritual practice is compassion for others.
” This sounds nice, but you may be fooling yourself.
When you investigate your mind carefully, you will discover that there is no one in the whole universe that you care for more than yourself.
There’s nothing wrong with this.
In fact, compassion for ourselves is the basis for our practice of compassion toward others.
As the Buddha said: “Investigating the whole world with my mind, never did I find anyone dearer than myself.
It is a mistake to think that it is more refined or “spiritual” to think harshly about yourself or to view yourself as unworthy.
The Buddha found through his own experience that self-mortification does not lead to enlightenment.
Of course, we do need to cultivate self-restraint, but we do so out of the determination to act in our own best interests.
Seen rightly, kind and gentle self-discipline is actually an aspect of practicing compassion for ourselves.
Moreover, it is impossible to practice genuine compassion for others without the foundation of self-compassion.
If we try to act compassionately out of a sense of personal unworthiness or the belief that others are more important than we are, the true source of our actions is aversion for ourselves, not compassion for others.
Similarly, if we offer help out of a sense of cold superiority to those we are assisting, our actions may actually be motivated by pride.
Genuine compassion, as we have seen, arises from the tender heart we feel for our own suffering, which we then see mirrored in the suffering of others.
Self-compassion, grounded in wholesome self-love, motivates us to reach out sincerely to help.
Firefighters show a good example of this motivation.
They are known for their great courage in willingly risking their lives to save people trapped in a burning building.
They do not deliberately sacrifice themselves, however.
They do not carelessly rush into the flames, unequipped to deal with the dangers of the situation.
Instead, they take every precaution, putting on helmets and heavy gear, making careful plans, and relying on their judgment and skill to determine the best way to save others without endangering themselves.
In the same way, we clothe ourselves with compassion and loving-friendliness toward ourselves, purifying our motives to the best of our abilities and allowing our minds to become clear and bright.
From that place of clarity, we can help others effectively and also encourage our own spiritual progress.
Actually, the division between self and other is more blurred in our minds than we usually realize.
Whatever attitudes we habitually use toward ourselves, we will use on others, and whatever attitudes we habitually use toward others, we will use on ourselves.
The situation is comparable to our serving food to ourselves and to other people from the same bowl.
Everyone ends up eating the same thing.
So we must examine carefully what we are dishing out.
As we sit in meditation, we should examine how we act toward ourselves and others when things do not go the way we hoped, or when mistakes happen.
Although it is important for us to notice our mistakes, feel their effects, and pledge to improve, self-blame and other harshness serves no useful purpose.
No one feels peaceful after being scolded.
Generally, people recoil and become angry, defensive, or stubborn.
Think, for example, of a man who is exercising to lose weight.
It is ignorant.
It suffers.
That is why we do regrettable things.
Remembering that we make mistakes because of our own suffering helps us extend compassion to ourselves, rather than harsh judgment and self-abuse.
It is especially important that we approach our efforts to meditate and follow the path of the Buddha with a compassionate attitude.
We practice the Buddha’s eight steps to happiness to alleviate our suffering.
They clamp down on the mind and try to make it behave by sheer force of will.
But the mind does not follow anybody’s command.
Often, they get frustrated and become self-judging and harsh.
A similar thing can happen to more experienced students who feel disappointed that they have not yet achieved their spiritual goals.
It is important for any student of the Buddha’s path to remember that there is a difference between watching the mind and controlling the mind.
Watching the mind with a gentle, open attitude allows the mind to settle down and come to rest.
Trying to control the mind, or trying to control the way that one’s spiritual practice will unfold, just stirs up more agitation and suffering.
We can open and soften our minds.
Nothing that arises in meditation is a sign of failure.
There is only the failure to watch.
If unwholesome thoughts arise and persist, we should not struggle with them or beat ourselves up.
Instead, we should calmly and compassionately apply Skillful Effort to overcome them and to uplift the mind.
No one is uniquely bad.
Everyone in the world has the same problems.
Greed, anger, jealousy, pride, bad days, disappointments, and impatience come to all unenlightened beings.
When we make a habit of meeting the mind’s many changes with compassion, the mind can relax.
Then, we can see more clearly, and we continue to grow in understanding.
Compassion for Our Parents
Many of us have hard, unkind feelings toward our parents.
Some find it difficult to forgive things they did when we were children.
Child abuse and other harmful actions may have caused us pain and suffering.
These misdeeds cannot be excused; nor can they be forgotten easily.
What they did can never be undone.
But what we do in this moment can affect our current and future happiness.
One way to develop compassion is to think about how much your parents suffered in bringing you into the world and raising you.
The Buddha said that even if you carry your parents, one on each shoulder, for the rest of your life, caring for all of their needs, still you would not have repaid them for what they have done for you.
Parents sacrifice sleep, comfort, food, time, and energy, for days, months, years.
Consider the utter helplessness of a baby, how demanding its needs are.
Rather than blaming them for acting in confused ways, consider the pain and suffering their confused minds must have caused them as they wrestled with the challenges of caring for a child.
Consider how hard they may have struggled to free themselves from addictions and other destructive behaviors motivated by desire, hatred, and ignorance.
Then consider that the parents who raised you are not identical to the parents you know today.
Time has passed, and impermanence changes everyone.
As your parents have grown older, they may have softened or developed greater wisdom.
You have matured as well.
Don’t stay stuck in your childhood relationship.
As your parents age, you may even need to switch roles and provide them with material, emotional, and spiritual support.
Caring for your parents’ needs can open your heart of compassion.
Even if your parents never gave you anything but your life and endless pain, you can at least feel sorry for them and wish them happiness: “I wish I could help my parents to have a better state of mind.
” Compassion has no limit, no boundary.
Compassion for Children
Maintaining equilibrium in your life can be doubly hard when you are raising children.
Bringing up children in a balanced manner can be compared to walking a tightrope five hundred feet above the ground.
On the one hand, dealing with them in a harsh and rigid manner may earn your children’s lasting enmity.
On the other hand, without giving them structure and a sense of discipline, children will not learn about limits or the consequences of their actions.
If children are loved and taught, trained, and cared for with the honor and respect they deserve as human beings, they will mature into responsible, loving, and kind adults.
Your children will shoulder the burdens of the world after you have gone.
They can bring peace and happiness to you, to other members of the family, to society, and to the whole world.
But as any parent knows, children can try the patience of the most tolerant person.
When you find yourself struggling with them, remind yourself to find a place of selflessness in your heart.
Let go of your need for things to turn out the way you want.
Put more effort into understanding your children’s points of view, their needs, fears, or concerns; and when you have a better grasp of what they are struggling with, your heart will melt with compassion.
With a compassionate state of mind, your actions will always carry a tone of kindness and softness, which is very useful in overcoming difficulty with anyone, child or adult.
If you lack compassion for your children, you can, fortunately, still cultivate it; it just takes practice.
People are not born knowing how best to raise a child to become a healthy, responsible, loving adult.
This skill must be learned.
If you are a parent, it is incumbent upon you to learn as much as possible about how to bring up children in a wholesome way, without teaching them greed, hatred, and ignorance.
These unwholesome influences are already abundant enough in the world.
Above all, you can show compassion to children when you teach them letting go, loving-friendliness, and compassion.
We each have a different personal style.
Some of us are good at expressing emotions; we laugh and cry easily and often.
Others find it hard to say what we’re feeling and never cry at all.
Some of us are happiest when we’re working and enjoy putting in long hours on the job.
Others get their work done quickly and prefer to spend their time reading, meditating, or visiting friends.
None of these styles are right or wrong.
Both are trying to avoid suffering and to be as happy as possible.
Both can be good, kind human beings.
You may need to do some hard inner work before your compassion can arise.
In meditation, you can reflect on your own unskillful actions of body, speech, and mind, identifying all the ways in which you have been greedy, selfish, hateful, jealous, or proud.
Rather, focus on your own actions and take responsibility for them.
Remind yourself that you have caused this person you love to suffer.
You’ve had an ugly quarrel in the morning, let’s say.
Through your compassion, the relationship between the two of you heals.
As we sit in meditation many things go through our minds.
We may hear sounds, feel an itch, and think about many kinds of things.
We may even forget briefly that we are meditating and that we are trying to stay focused on the breath.
This is normal; it happens to everybody.
When something takes our attention away from the breath, we should examine it briefly, just long enough to notice its impermanence—how it arises, peaks, and falls away.
Then we return to the breath.
Some thoughts or mental states, however, are tricky and require special attention: the unwholesome thoughts arising from greed, hatred, or delusion whenever we are not mindful.
No wisdom develops while the mind is lost in unwholesome thoughts.
Not only do we waste our time and create painful feelings, we also reinforce the mental habits that cause all our suffering.
We must overcome unwholesome thoughts right away, quickly rebuking them with mindfulness before they overtake us, become entrenched, and dominate the meditation session.
Sometimes such thoughts go away by the simple act of giving brief attention to their impermanence.
Other times, we must rouse strong effort to overcome them.
We will examine various ways to do this when we discuss Skillful Effort.
Once an unwholesome thought has been overcome, we go back to the breath with a slightly deeper level of focus.
If another negative thought arises, we repeat our efforts.
Each time an unwholesome thought has been overcome, we deepen our concentration.
Eventually, we find that our concentration is so steady that all thoughts stop coming.
It may take many meditation sessions for this state of concentration to come about, or it may happen more quickly.
Once we have achieved deep concentration, we can use that powerful state to return to our practice of mindfulness, again examining objects as they come to our attention.
Since thoughts have vanished, we examine other objects, such as body sensations or positive mental qualities like bliss or equanimity.
We focus on the impermanence and related characteristics of these objects, just as before, but with strong concentration, our insight grows dramatically.
So long as the state of strong concentration lasts, no unwholesome thoughts arise to disrupt our meditation.
Until we reach that level of concentrated meditation, however, we must skillfully deal with unwholesome thoughts as they arise.
We must tackle such thoughts whenever they come up, even outside meditation sessions.
Mindfulness of Skillful Thinking refers to all these efforts.
One of the methods for overcoming an unwholesome thought is to examine the downsides of that thought.
You see how it debases the mind.
You see how your habitual negative thinking causes difficulties in your life.
Then you can cultivate the opposite, a wholesome thought, such as the feeling of compassion.
This is a great opportunity for you to look at yourself and change your life by changing your thinking.
There is much work to be done in meditation.
The same difficult mental states that create problems in our daily lives—greed, fear, anger, jealousy, self-criticism—come to us in meditation.
They may emerge in the form of unwholesome thinking at any moment in which our mindfulness or concentration lapses.
First we make effort to simply let go of those thoughts.
We do this both to purify the mind in this moment and to train the mind in the habit of self-purification.
When a thought is so strong that it persists despite your best efforts, that is the signal to do more intensive work.
Now you must look hard at these thoughts and put them to use to develop insight into your life.
For example, let’s say that in meditation I get lost in angry thoughts about a stranger who insulted me.
I’ve tried other methods for overcoming these thoughts, but the thoughts don’t go away.
So I examine them.
First, I look at how this thought is affecting my practice, how it creates tension in my body and affects my blood pressure, how it generates a lingering sense of ill will toward this person.
I see that such angry thoughts are no good, because they hurt me and affect my mind so negatively that I may even harm others.
Next, perhaps, I consider how embarrassed I would be if others knew what I was thinking, and I develop a wholesome sense of shame that such thoughts dominate my mind.
This kind of examination often creates enough distance to free the mind from the negative state.
Once the mind is clear, I may examine my thoughts more deeply, reflecting on what caused them.
Let me do better next time.
Reflecting thus upon my unskillful motives and actions, I resolve to improve.
Before his enlightenment, the Buddha himself practiced in this way, using his unwholesome thoughts as a means to look inside and correct his faults.
As he meditated in the forest before his enlightenment, the Buddha said to himself, “I have this weakness.
I have done that in the past.
From now on, my behavior must be different.
You can do the same.
If you recall an occasion when you spoke harshly to a child and saw hurt and puzzlement in her eyes, you can resolve to apologize to her and to speak more compassionately in the future.
Or if you recall a conversation when you held on stubbornly to your views, even when they were shown to be mistaken, resolve to let go of grasping more gracefully next time.
If a persistent desire arises, such as for ice cream or a new CD, you can use the opportunity to cultivate its opposite, generosity.
You can think, “I don’t need that right now.
I can let go of this desire.
” If your perspective is generous and open-hearted, eventually the desire for that sense pleasure will diminish.
You can then recognize how petty or self-centered your desire really was.
By so doing, you come to better understand the nature of craving.
After using this new understanding to correct your thinking, return to the breath.
Another good strategy when your thinking has spun out of control and your mind is filled with pain, restlessness, and worry is to use your own suffering to cultivate wholesome thoughts of compassion.
Everyone experiences it, and right now there are many others who are suffering more than I am.
A student of mine told me that at one time he was feeling tremendously depressed.
Walking alone in a park one day, he came across a scrap of newspaper.
He picked it up and read a story of a man who was walking along, deeply miserable because he had only one shoe.
As he limped along, his bare foot cold and sore, the man with one shoe passed a man who had only one leg.
Gratitude filled his heart.
“Well, at least I still have both legs!” the man said to himself, and his sorrow left him.
Reading this story, my student felt a surge of compassion for those whose troubles are worse than his own, and his depression vanished.
You can use a similar technique anytime thoughts of grief, anger, or mental pain overwhelm you.
I have access to spiritual teachings, and time and a place to meditate.
Compared to many people in the world, I live in luxury.
Millions of people have no home, no food, no hope.
Rather than feeling unhappy, let me cultivate compassion for these people.
” Compassion calms and soothes our thoughts, so that we can return to the breath with a steadier, more concentrated mind.
This kind of training is not just for formal meditation.
What we do in sitting practice, we must carry over to every other moment.
We take our training in mindfulness with us into our everyday lives and apply it in all circumstances: on the bus, at work, when we are feeling ill, when we are out shopping.
Say you are visiting a shopping mall and see some attractive items in the store window.
Because of your undisciplined thoughts, you cannot pull your eyes away.
You enter the shop and examine the items.
You feel you cannot leave without buying one or two.
Perhaps you do not have the cash right now, but you have your credit card.
You pick something up and buy it.
To practice Skillful Thinking, you must stop yourself during this process, just as you would when recognizing an unwholesome thought while sitting on the cushion.
First, sort through and identify your thoughts and feelings.
Inquire whether greed or fear or insecurity is driving you to make an unnecessary purchase.
Then reason with yourself: “I want to pay off the balance on this card.
Do I really want to go deeper into debt?”
Even if you have plenty of money, it is still important to purify greed from your thinking process.
Such training will definitely help us when we encounter more difficult challenges.
Once I had to use my practice of Skillful Thinking to overcome fear in a situation of genuine danger.
I had received word of my mother’s final illness.
On the way to Sri Lanka from Washington, D.C, I changed planes to a jumbo jet in Hawaii.
An hour or two after taking off from Hawaii, I looked out my window and noticed flames coming from the plane’s engine.
Then the pilot’s voice came over the intercom.
He announced that the engine was on fire and that we were turning back.
When we landed, floor lights would lead us to the eight emergency doors.
The doors would open, and emergency chutes would come out.
We were to jump onto the chutes without a moment’s hesitation, slide down, and run away from the plane.
I doubt anybody understood much of these instructions.
From the moment the pilot had announced that the engine was on fire, everyone in the cabin seemed to be seized with fear of death.
Some started crossing themselves, couples clutched each other and kissed, others wept or looked tense and anxious.
I thought, “If this is my time to die, well, I will die anyway, whether I am afraid or not.
I considered that death is inevitable, and that this would be a good time for me to die, for I had been doing good deeds, and I had nothing to regret.
Then I thought about the likely sequence of events.
I exhorted myself, “I have to keep my mind very clear, very pure, before I lose consciousness.
This is the time to use my mindfulness to realize the inevitability of death.
If I die peacefully with a pure, clear state of mind, my future life will be bright.
Perhaps I will attain a stage of enlightenment through seeing the truth of impermanence.
I must not block my mind with fear or confusion.
No matter how strong my attachment to life, I must let go of that attachment now.”
Thus I made the effort to prevent any unwholesome state of mind from arising in the face of death and encouraged wholesome states of mind to arise.
Perhaps I was just too stunned to feel afraid, but I felt no fear.
You seldom see such blue flames.
Sometimes they were streaming out; sometimes they were low.
They looked like fireworks, or the aurora borealis.
While I was enjoying the drama, the three hundred or so other people on the plane were suffering terribly.
I looked at the other passengers from time to time and saw the agony they suffered from the very thought of death.
They kept laughing and playing as they did before the crisis.
I thought, “Let me put myself in their place, in a childlike mind.
We did make it back to Hawaii, and the plane made an emergency landing.
We went out the emergency doors as instructed, sliding down the chutes.
Going down the chute was an entirely new experience for me.
Perhaps everyone else on the plane had at least gone down a playground slide in their childhood, but I had never done such a thing in the poor village where I grew up.
Thus right up to the end, I enjoyed it all very much.
As we are discovering, walking the Buddha’s path to happiness requires practicing each of the eight steps in the real world.
We need recipients to accept our generous gifts.
We needs friends and enemies to inspire our friendly love.
We need suffering beings to develop our compassion.
Human society provides a perfect testing ground for these key points of Skillful Thinking:
When we develop Skillful Understanding, Skillful Thinking flows naturally.
Thinking can make us happy or miserable.
The Buddha pointed us toward three skillful thoughts: letting go or generosity in the highest sense, loving-friendliness, and compassion.
Begin your practice of generosity with giving away material things.
Clinging to anything—form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, or consciousness—makes us unhappy.
When fear arises, let it grow and watch as it peaks and fades away.
Loving-friendliness, a sense of interconnectedness with all beings and a sincere wish for them to be happy, has far-reaching effects.
Your anger will ultimately hurt you more than the person you’re angry with; take action to overcome your anger.
Mindfulness can help you minimize and eventually eliminate your anger.
Compassion is a spontaneous, wholesome melting of the heart at the suffering of others, coupled with a wish to alleviate their pain.
When negative thoughts arise during meditation, they may go away if you merely pay attention to their passing nature.
If a negative train of thought persists despite your best efforts, that is the signal to explore it thoroughly—to develop insight into the habits of your life.
Practicing Skillful Thinking on the cushion can help you check your fear, anger, and craving in everyday life.
STEP 3 - Skillful Speech
THINK HOW OFTEN you say to yourself, “If only I hadn’t said that,” or something like “When I saw the look on her face, I knew that what I said had hurt her feelings.
Wrong speech causes us many problems.
These bad habits of speech are not new.
The Buddha considered the practice of Skillful Speech so essential to one’s personal and spiritual development that he gave it its own step on the path to happiness.
Skillful Speech, the Buddha told us, has four qualities: It is always truthful.
It is moderate, not useless or meaningless.
A person who is known for gentle and beautiful speech, the Buddha explained, will quickly be trusted and respected.
Such a person enjoys a calm and peaceful state of mind and is able to interact with others lovingly.
If we habitually malign others, people find it easier to speak harshly of us.
If we are known for truthfulness, our words are more readily believed.
If we have a reputation for discretion, others find it harder to spread gossip about us.
If our speech is always kind and gentle, others feel embarrassed to swear or speak crudely in our presence.
It is clear that speech creates an environment that either contributes to happiness or destroys it.
We know this is so because our own experience shows us that how we think and act is heavily influenced by the kind of speech that goes on around us.
One of the Buddha’s first nuns observed in verse:
If he resorted to noble friends,
Even a fool would become wise.
If we wish to be wise, we must not only seek out noble friends but be a noble friend to others.
Doing so requires that we make a mindful effort to practice Skillful Speech.
A Buddhist folk story illustrates how strongly speech can influence our behavior:
A monk in the Buddha’s entourage had a habit of eating sumptuous meals with a group of people misled by the evil monk Devadatta.
Tempted by the delicious food these people offered, this monk spent much time in the unwholesome company of this group.
The Buddha reprimanded the monk for choosing such companions and warned him of the consequences.
To convince him to change his behavior, the Buddha told the monk the story of an incident that had taken place in a former life, in which the monk had been led astray by the harsh, unwholesome speech of those around him.
In a previous birth, the Buddha said, the monk had been a great elephant belonging to a king.
This elephant was known for his gentle disposition.
Then a group of burglars made a habit of gathering near the elephant’s stall each night to discuss their evil plans.
They spoke harshly and encouraged each other to commit murder and other cruel acts.
The elephant began to believe that their rough words were intended to teach him that he should behave in similar ways.
As a result, the formerly noble elephant became murderous, killing anyone who tried to work with him.
The king who owned the elephant sent his minister—the aspiring Buddha—to investigate what was corrupting the gentle elephant.
The minister overheard the wicked speech of the burglars and saw how it affected the elephant.
He advised the king to send wise sages, known for their gentle speech, to talk together near the elephant’s stall every night.
The good and wholesome speech soon influenced the elephant to return to his gentle ways, and he was never cruel again.
Skillful Speech can improve your life in many ways.
Let’s look more closely at the four qualities of Skillful Speech and explore how they might help us along on the path to happiness.
The first quality of Skillful Speech is that it is always truthful.
Never lie, the Buddha told us, whether for your own advantage, for someone else’s advantage, or for any advantage whatsoever.
The Buddha summed up the guidelines for truth-telling this way:
When [someone is] questioned as a witness thus, “So, good man, tell what you know”: knowing, he says, “I know”; not knowing, he says, “I do not know”; not seeing, he says, “I do not see”; or seeing, he says, “I see”; he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends, or another’s ends, or for some trifling worldly end.
If our silence would convey a lie, then we must speak.
For example, a police investigator at the scene of a crime asks a crowd of on-lookers whether they saw anything.
If everyone remains silent, the investigator will conclude that no one has seen the crime occur.
If some of the onlookers are witnesses, then they lie by remaining silent.
They may feel that they have good reason to say nothing, such as fear of retaliation, but their silence is a lie nonetheless.
We can also lie with our body language.
Sometimes a shrug or a raised eyebrow may convey “I don’t know.” But if you do know, your shrug is a deception.
There are situations, however, where the truth has to be withheld because speaking up might hurt someone.
In such cases, we have to wait for the right time to speak the right words to the right person.
The Buddha himself frequently resorted to silence when his answering a question would cause someone harm.
Once a man asked the Buddha whether there is life after death.
The Buddha just sat there, silent, until the man gave up and went away.
Later, his attendant, Ananda, asked the Buddha why he had not answered.
The Buddha explained that any answer would have caused the man suffering.
If he had answered that there is continuation after death, the Buddha knew that the man would have seized on the idea of an eternally existing self, a wrong understanding that leads to suffering.
If he had answered negatively, the man would have developed another wrong understanding, thinking, “Then I will be annihilated!” and would have suffered greatly on that account.
To avoid causing harm to the man, the Buddha decided not to make any response at all.
The Buddha described the guidelines by which he himself decided whether to speak or to remain silent.
If he knew something was untrue, incorrect, or not beneficial, he would not say it.
“Such speech does not utter,” he said.
If he knew that something was true, correct, and beneficial, then “the Buddha knows the time to use such speech.
” When his words were true, correct, beneficial, and timely, the Buddha spoke regardless of whether his words would be “unwelcome and disagreeable to others” or “welcome and agreeable to others.”
Deeply compassionate and fully focused on people’s well-being, the Buddha never spoke only to be a “people pleaser.”
We can learn much from his example.
When I am tempted to speak words that do not meet the Buddha’s guidelines, I remind myself that I gain nothing by speaking, nor does anyone else gain, and nobody loses by my keeping quiet.
For example, let’s say I am talking with friends, one of whom is monopolizing the conversation.
I have something to say and feel impatient to say it.
I have reflected on what I want to say and know it is true as to past events, correct as to current facts, and that it would benefit the listeners.
If I blurt it out now, however, I may offend the speaker.
I can say what I want to say some other time.
The second aspect of Skillful Speech is avoiding malicious talk.
As an old folk saying tells us, “The tongue is a boneless weapon trapped between teeth.
” When we speak malicious words, our tongue releases verbal daggers.
Such words rob people of their good name and their credibility.
Even when what we say about someone is true, if its intent is to cause the person harm, it is malicious.
The Buddha defined malicious talk as speech that destroys the friendship between two people.
Here’s an example: Suppose on a trip I meet one of your good friends who lives far away.
I remember that several months before, you had told me an unflattering story about this fellow.
I may not remember your exact words, so I add a little flavor when I repeat what you said.
I even make it look like I am doing this guy a favor to let him know that you have been talking about him behind his back.
Your friend responds in some heat.
When I get home, I repeat his words to you, spicing them up a bit to make it a better story.
Because it causes disharmony and breaks up a friendship, such speech is malicious.
Sometimes we disguise malicious speech as concern about another’s behavior.
Or we reveal a secret that someone has confided to us, believing that we are doing so “for his own good.”
For instance, telling a woman that her husband is being unfaithful because “you don’t want her to be the last to know” may cause more suffering for everyone involved.
When you are tempted to speak in such a way, ask yourself what you hope to gain.
If your goal is to manipulate others or to earn someone’s gratitude or appreciation, your speech is self-serving and malicious rather than virtuous.
Public speech can be malicious as well.
Tabloid newspapers, talk radio, Internet chat rooms, and even some respectable news media seem to be making their living today using words as weapons.
A fresh shot at this week’s media target scores points that translate into increased viewers and advertising dollars.
Malicious speech knocks someone down to raise someone else up.
It tries to make the speaker look incisive, smart, or hip at another’s expense.
Not all malicious speech sounds nasty.
Sometimes people use words that seem gentle but have a derogatory meaning.
Such disguised verbal daggers are even more dangerous than overtly malicious words because they more easily penetrate the listener’s mind and heart.
In modern terms, we call such speech a “backhanded compliment.”
Isn’t it wonderful that looking older is acceptable in our profession?” Skillful Speech not only means that we pay attention to the words we speak and to their tone but also requires that our words reflect compassion and concern for others and that they help and heal, rather than wound and destroy.
The third kind of wrong speech is harsh language.
Verbal abuse, profanity, sarcasm, hypocrisy, and excessively blunt or belittling criticism are all examples of harsh language.
Speech is a powerful tool that can be used for good or for ill.
The Buddha compared speech to an ax:
Every person who is born
is born with an ax in his mouth.
A fool who uses abusive language
cuts himself and others with that ax.
We probably think of an ax merely as a tool for chopping firewood.
But in the Buddha’s day, the ax was a tool of precision and power.
It was used to cut long planks of wood and plane them perfectly smooth and to carve and chisel wood precisely.
It could cut down a mighty tree.
And it was a deadly weapon, a brutal means to maim or kill.
Perhaps a modern parallel to the ax is the computer.
Computers can be used to do many wonderful things—to communicate across oceans, make music, or direct a flight to Mars.
They can also be used for destruction.
Computers help wage wars by controlling missiles and other weapons.
Just as we must choose how we will use the power of an ax or a computer, we must choose how we will use our speech.
We are also fools if we think that harsh language ever accomplishes anything positive.
Though we may feel very self-satisfied when we have dressed someone down, as we say—given them a piece of our minds—we have won no genuine victory.
As the Buddha said:
The fool thinks he has won a battle,
when he bullies with harsh speech;
but knowing how to be forbearing
alone makes one victorious.
It is easy to silence people by using harsh, insulting words.
A smart adversary will generally withdraw from such an interchange and respond to our harsh words with icy silence.
We may congratulate ourselves and think, I really showed him—he shut right up when he heard what I had to say.
But our apparent victory is hollow.
Our opponent may have pledged never to speak to us again or vowed to thwart us secretly sometime in the future.
The ill will and bad feelings we cause will boomerang and strike us when we least anticipate it.
It’s easy to think of other examples of the negative effects of harsh language.
Perhaps you have a co-worker with enormous talent or technical genius, whose mouth always gets him into trouble.
He bullies his associates with words that are harsh, abrasive, arrogant, and obnoxious.
Despite the quality of his work, people cannot tolerate him, so his career goes nowhere.
Haven’t we all overheard parents telling their children, “You’re a disgrace,” “You can’t do anything right,” “You’ll never amount to anything.
” Perhaps we remember being told such things when we were small.
Verbal abuse can leave scars on the heart of a child that never completely heal.
Of course, parents might sometimes have to speak sharply to a child to stop the child from doing something dangerous, like playing with matches or running into the street.
But such strong speech is motivated by love and care, not by the wish to bully or belittle.
Animals also feel the effect of harsh speech.
My grandnephew has a great Alaskan husky named Taurus.
Taurus is fascinated by the animals on television.
He even tries to bite them.
Because he is so large, when Taurus is attracted to what he sees on the screen, he blocks the view of the people sitting behind him.
One day a member of my grandnephew’s family ordered Taurus to get out of the way.
Her tone of voice was excessively hard and stern.
The dog reacted by going to the basement.
For a week Taurus stayed down there, refusing to come out, even to eat.
Finally, the family had to go and plead with him, using sweet words, in affectionate tones, before Taurus rejoined them.
The soft words of my grandnephew’s family won back the companionship of their beloved pet.
Kind language, as another early Buddhist saying tells us, is always appropriate and welcome:
Speak kind words, words
rejoiced at and welcomed,
words that bear ill will to none;
always speak kindly to others.
They help us make and keep friends, for everyone wants to associate with people whose soft and gentle speech makes them feel relaxed, comfortable, and safe.
Soft words help children flourish and grow up with a positive feeling of self-worth.
Such words can also help people learn and appreciate the Buddha’s message.
There is no limit to the amount of joy we can spread to those around us if we speak with kindness and skill.
A word of caution: Soft words must also be sincere and motivated by a noble purpose.
Speaking gently and kindly while thinking or doing the opposite is hypocrisy, not virtue.
We have all heard religious leaders who use soft words to spread fear or manipulate people into sending money to their organization.
I remember a man in Sri Lanka who toured the country speaking against the evils of alcohol.
This man rose to fame, power, and popularity, drawing large crowds due to the power of his oration.
He galvanized the campaign to close the bars, shut down the breweries, and end the sale of liquor.
One hot summer day, during one of his powerful speeches, the man carelessly whipped off his jacket.
A small bottle of alcohol fell from an inside pocket and hit the floor of the stage.
That was the end of the prohibition campaign, and of this man’s public career.
Even though what the man was saying about the poison of alcohol was true, once people saw the poison of this man’s hypocrisy, they could no longer buy his message.
The fourth type of wrong speech is gossip, which the Buddha described as foolish or meaningless talk.
Gossip about other people is a problem regardless of whether what we say about someone else is true.
After all, if three people relate a story about a fourth person, each story will be different.
Human nature is such that we tend to believe whatever we hear first, even though it is just one person’s version.
It may be based on truth, but gossip will embellish and exaggerate it.
Gossip leads to quarrels and misunderstandings.
It can break up relationships.
In the most serious cases, it can lead to lawsuits for libel or defamation.
In the Buddha’s time, the power of gossip toppled a great confederacy:
The Licchavi people were a proud, free clan, one of the most powerful and important members of a strong confederacy of eight clans.
Their capital city was the capital of the confederacy.
An ambitious ruler, King Ajatasattu, the principal supporter of the evil monk Devadatta, planned to invade and defeat the Licchavi people.
The king asked the Buddha his opinion of his plan to invade.
The Buddha spoke of the harmony in which the Licchavi people lived and told the king, “You cannot invade them so long as they remain unified and harmonious.”
The king postponed his attack and pondered the Buddha’s statement.
Then King Ajatasattu came up with a simple and devious plan.
He instructed his prime minister to whisper something into the ear of a Licchavi man.
The prime minister went up to one of the Licchavi men and whispered emphatically, “There is rice in a paddy seed.”
It was a trivial, meaningless statement.
Everyone knew that rice can be found in a paddy seed.
But seeing something whispered, another Licchavi man began wondering what King Ajatasattu’s prime minister had said to this fellow.
When he asked the man what had been said, the man repeated the statement about the paddy seed.
Hearing this, the second Licchavi man thought, “This guy is hiding the truth.
He doesn’t trust me.
He fabricated this silly statement about the paddy seed to deceive me.”
Filled with suspicion, he told another Licchavi clansman that the man had been whispering with the prime minister.
That person told another, and so on, until people believed that the man was a spy and that a secret conspiracy was being hatched in their midst.
Peace was shattered.
Accusations and arguments arose among the Licchavi people, and fighting broke out among the leading families.
With his enemy in disarray, King Ajatasattu invaded the Licchavi people, and his troops conquered them easily.
He then went on to conquer the rest of the confederacy.
I don’t need such accounts to convince myself that gossip is harmful.
I have experienced myself how damaging gossip can be.
It seems that whenever someone tries to do something for the good of society, some people feel opposed to that effort.
Maybe they feel insecure or jealous of another’s success.
Rumors are their weapons.
They do not have to come forth and provide any evidence.
They can whisper insinuations and rely upon other people’s willingness to engage in careless talk to do their dirty work.
When we were first trying to raise funds to build our center, some people spread rumors about the Bhavana Society.
People said that I was bilking donors, intending to use the funds we collected to start a shady business for profit.
Unsigned letters were sent to key people, telling them not to contribute.
The gossip was started maliciously, but it was spread by people who simply did not know the truth.
The Buddhist community in the city in which I lived, which had initially been supportive, became divided.
Fortunately, those who opposed the building of the Bhavana Society could not find any real faults to magnify, or they would have completely destroyed our efforts.
So long as people are willing to believe whatever they hear and repeat things carelessly, rumors will circulate.
Once an American member of the board of directors of the Bhavana Society traveled to Sri Lanka.
While there, he joined a group of meditation practitioners from various countries, and they spent an evening talking together about meditation centers in various places.
Finally our member said, “Well, I have known Bhante Gunaratana since 1971 and have been involved with the Bhavana Society since its inception.
I know there is no tea ceremony there.”
If someone who knew the truth had not been present, no one would have been able to contradict the woman’s statement.
Perhaps others would have added further untrue comments and maybe even hurtful things.
That is how gossip gets started and how it damages people and institutions.
If we hear someone gossip or say something damaging, we have two choices: either we end the conversation or we discourage the person from speaking negatively, as our board member did in this case.
Many of us spend a great deal of time chattering about the food we ate several days or months ago, or trying to remember the details of some silly movie or TV show that we saw.
We waste even more time saying things simply to make others laugh.
This kind of talk does not lead to any deepening of wisdom.
Now, it’s true that some seemingly idle or silly talk may actually serve an important purpose.
Sometimes we must speak soft meaningless words to comfort someone or to bond lovingly with our children.
Skillful Speech is not something you practice on the cushion.
It happens in dialogue, not silence.
During formal meditation, however, you can think about your habits of speech and try to convert the thoughts that arise to skillful thoughts—those motivated by generosity, loving-friendliness, and compassion.
The most important resolution you can make is to think before you speak.
People say, “Watch your tongue!” But it’s more important to watch your mind.
The tongue does not wag by itself.
The mind controls it.
Before you open your mouth, check your mind to see whether your motivation is wholesome.
You will come to regret any speech motivated by greed, hatred, or delusion.
Also make a strong determination not to say anything that might hurt another person.
This pledge will definitely help you to think carefully before you speak.
When you speak mindfully, you automatically speak truthfully, gently, and kindly.
Mindfulness will keep you from using verbal daggers that can pierce people to the marrow.
If the intent to speak in a harmful way occurs to you, immediately use mindfulness and Skillful Effort to prevent these thoughts from continuing.
The pledge not to wound others with your speech is especially important when talking with someone toward whom you feel resentment, or when discussing a situation about which you have strong feelings.
Speaking softly can bring peace and harmony to the situation and help the conversation to continue in a productive, profitable, and friendly way.
If someone approaches you and speaks irritatingly—nagging or gossiping about one of your friends, for instance—and you notice yourself getting upset, simply stop talking.
Remind yourself silently, “I must not be reactive.
I must not fall into the same lack of mindfulness as this person.
This conversation is not going anywhere.
I choose to engage only in meaningful conversation.
” In many cases, the other person will respond to your silence by stopping the irritating talk.
You can use the pause that follows to turn the conversation in a better direction.
Actually, as someone following the Buddha’s path, the moment you know that a conversation is heading in the wrong direction, you should take responsibility for putting it back on track.
It is so easy to get carried away with emotional talk and start shouting.
A shouting match causes unhappiness to everyone involved.
With mindfulness recall how awful you feel when you are out of control emotionally.
Remind yourself that it may take hours or days before you calm down enough to talk to this person again.
A lot of good feelings will be lost, perhaps permanently.
In spite of all your good efforts, however, sometimes you still get angry.
If another person continually provokes you, assaulting you with verbal daggers, you may become completely confused and bewildered.
Then it is very easy for anger to arise.
When you see your confusion building up, say “Wait a minute!” to the other person, with the hope of finding a moment to clear your mind.
But what if the other person responds with “No, you wait a minute!” and continues to attack—then what?
In these situations, when the conversation spins out of control, your task is to bring mindfulness back quickly and use Skillful Effort to overcome the anger.
Even if your feelings of anger cause your heart to beat fast, your body to break into a sweat, and your hands to shake, mindfulness of your resolution to avoid all harsh speech can help you stay in control.
Simply refuse to let your anger tell you what to say.
Concentrate on your breathing to reestablish mindfulness until your anger has died down.
Calming yourself gives both you and the other person a chance to open your hearts in a more friendly way.
As your heart begins to warm, you see the other more clearly, and maybe you will understand why you both got upset.
You can also see how confused an angry state of mind makes you.
As your feelings of respect and concern grow, you can resolve to use this moment to begin a new and more loving relationship and to strengthen the companionship between you.
That is what you should always hope to do.
I want always to act in ways that allow these good things to happen.”
Bring up that thought again and again.
Let me tell you a story of a time when I myself had to use mindfulness to practice Skillful Speech.
Perhaps my experience will give you some clues about how to apply mindfulness to situations that arise in your life—at your work, at home, and in your personal relationships.
Many years ago, when I was in charge of running a certain temple, a group of people called a meeting for temple supporters.
These people opposed some work I had initiated and needed a forum where they could express their frustrations.
They had been born into Buddhist families, but they had no interest in meditation.
In fact, they considered meditation a crazy thing to do.
Therefore they did not understand my work.
I expected to be on the hot seat during this meeting, but what happened was worse than anyone could have predicted.
About forty people were attending the meeting, including many of my relatives, close friends, and others who hoped to show support for my programs.
Before the meeting was properly opened, even before introductions had been made, a very simple man stood up and began to speak.
This fellow was uneducated and unskilled, with a tendency toward unrefined speech.
He had little to say about the temple business under discussion, but a lot to say about me.
In low, vulgar terms, he charged that I had done nothing for the temple for years, that I was damaging support for the temple, and so on.
He used socially unacceptable, derogatory, and hurtful language throughout this tirade, which went on for about twenty minutes.
During this shocking verbal assault, I worked with my mind.
To prevent anger from arising, I reasoned with myself.
I could see that the man was in a disturbed state, and I thought to myself, “I know this man to have a peaceful nature.
We have had a good relationship.
He must have been poisoned by someone else who feels strongly about these matters to say such things.
” As the man continued to speak, I reflected that I had had many opportunities for spiritual and cultural development that this man lacked.
I recalled that he had only an elementary school education, few skills, and little interest in spiritual training.
In this way, I tried to cultivate compassion for him and also gratitude that my training made it unlikely that I would ever speak or act as he was doing.
I also reflected on the context of what was happening.
I considered that if I were to say anything to oppose him, my supporters would stand up for me, and the meeting might degenerate into an ugly fight.
I watched people’s eyes getting bigger and saw them frowning at the man and shifting in their seats.
I am an elder in my family—a brother, uncle, granduncle, and great granduncle—and I am known to be a gentle monk.
Naturally, my family respects me and feels protective of me.
I knew that if I seemed to be hurt or upset by what this man was saying, my relatives would experience anger and other unwholesome states of mind.
They might even physically attack the man.
So I told myself: “Here I have to exercise mindfulness, patience, and understanding to bring peace to this meeting.”
I established mindfulness by concentrating on my breathing.
When challenged like this, it is very important to pause and take some deep breaths before responding—perhaps two minutes of deep breathing, or thirty inhalations and thirty exhalations.
This pause gives you time to relax and clear your mind, so you can speak sense, instead of blowing up.
Finally, the man seemed to have exhausted himself and stopped talking.
Everybody was tense.
They all looked at me.
In a quiet voice I said, “This gentleman has been a friend of mine.
He has been a very good supporter of this temple and has done many good and helpful things.
He also knows what I have done all these years for the temple.
But today, somehow, he seems to be upset, disappointed, and maybe not feeling quite himself.
Therefore I feel like giving my blessings to him and to everybody.
I asked everyone there to put their hands together in the prayer position and to reverence the Buddha by saying three times, “Homage to the Blissful One, the Noble One, the Fully Enlightened One.”
This is how we commonly begin formal ceremonies.
Then I led the group in taking the five precepts, which uplifted their minds and made sure that everyone recalled the Buddha’s guidelines for proper, harmless behavior.
And that was the end of it.
For some years, this man remained cold toward me, but later I had the opportunity to be of service to him when he went through some serious difficulties.
Since then and to this day, he remains friendly to me and expresses only his gratitude and respect.
Mindfulness is the key that helped me resolve this difficult situation.
The same technique can work for you.
I sometimes hear people say that things were happening so fast that “even with mindfulness” they could not control their actions or speech.
Saying “even with mindfulness” makes no sense.
Perhaps their mindfulness was weak or undermined by greed, hatred, or delusion.
But by definition, mindfulness keeps us in control of what we think, how we act, and what we say.
It’s impossible to shout at someone mindfully, or to abuse alcohol mindfully, or to engage in sexual misconduct mindfully.
If you are truly mindful, you simply cannot do these things!
Because our habits are so strong, whenever we open our mouths, things seem just to spill out.
We may not be aware of how much energy pours away with our speech.
With mindful awareness, we put a stop to this outpouring, and energy collects.
We can use this built-up energy to develop insight into the nature of our habits.
Using this energy as fuel, we can talk to ourselves mentally in meditation, taking stock of our actions, further training our minds.
I see this especially at the end of retreats.
A few moments before, a perfectly silent group of people were sitting still or moving slowly and quietly.
Then the Noble Silence of the retreat ends, and a roar of babbling conversation breaks out.
This flood of talk goes on for an hour or two, until all the built-up energy has dissipated.
The longer the retreat, the louder and more light-headed people will become, unless they make the effort to remain very mindful of their speech.
The only antidote for wrong speech is a strong dose of mindfulness—not just during retreats, or when you are in a challenging or difficult situation, but for your whole life.
Mindfulness of Skillful Speech will contribute to your happiness.
I guarantee it.
Here are the key points for preventing unhappiness by way of Skillful Speech:
Skillful speech requires that you abstain from lying, malicious words, harsh language, and useless talk.
Lying by omission is still lying.
Malicious talk is speech that destroys other people’s friendships or damages their reputations.
Harsh language hurts others and debases you.
Gossip and idle talk lead to quarrels and misunderstandings, waste your time, and create a confused state of mind.
All unnecessary speech not motivated by generosity, loving-friendliness, and compassion is harmful.
Using mindfulness to strengthen your resolution to say nothing hurtful and to use only soft, well-chosen words can bring harmony to any difficult situation.
STEP 4 - Skillful Action
S OME PEOPLE want a simple list of rules to follow so that they can be sure that they are acting in a moral and proper way.
Others need rules to feel secure that they will reach their spiritual goal, whether it be heaven or enlightenment.
The Buddha did offer a code of conduct that prevents us from adding to our suffering, but truly ethical behavior goes far beyond any list of rules.
Rather, it’s an interlocking set of principles concerning how our actions cause suffering to ourselves and to others—how each person’s moral choices impact the whole.
Buddhist morality begins with five moral principles that people are strongly advised to keep if they wish to make spiritual progress.
abstaining from killing
abstaining from stealing
abstaining from speaking falsely
abstaining from sexual misconduct
abstaining from misusing alcohol or other intoxicants
Followers of the Buddha are expected to undertake vows to observe these rules, called the five precepts.
However, these moral principles are not something created by the Buddha; they are timeless, basic, and universal.
Four of the five precepts are covered directly in the Eightfold Path.
Skillful Speech includes abstaining from false speech.
Skillful Action is defined as abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
At the initial stage of moral development, we need these five precepts, much as a child needs parents to enforce rules such as “Don’t touch a hot stove.”
When children grow up, they realize that their parents’ rules existed to prevent certain kinds of harm.
Similarly, when we have perfected our understanding of moral behavior, Skillful Action becomes automatic.
It becomes impossible to want to break the five precepts, and we no longer need to refer back to them to keep ourselves on track.
Traditionally we say that the step of Skillful Action consists of abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
Although we use the same words in the five precepts and in the definition of Skillful Action of the Eightfold Path, the meanings are a little different.
For the purpose of the precepts, the meaning is very simple and straightforward: Just don’t do these three things.
Killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct are three of the worst acts you can perform, and if you engage in them you’ll find no peace.
So, we make a strong, powerful resolution and adhere to it strictly.
However, when the Buddha defined Skillful Action of the Eightfold Path in terms of abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, he was giving only the most gross examples of violations that one may do to others.
Thus these abstentions should be understood not only in a limited way, in terms of keeping precepts, but also as broad guides for higher ethical behavior.
For example, in one of the talks in which he urged everyone to act compassionately to all living beings, the Buddha commented,
All living beings are afraid of the stick [violence];
All living beings fear death.
Comparing oneself to others,
Don’t hurt or cause another [to hurt].
He explained that any physical action that hurts another person—vandalizing property, arson, intimidating someone with a weapon—is wrong, even if no one is killed.
I once heard of a young man who disliked his roommates in graduate school.
There is a more refined level of ethical action as well.
For example, abstaining from killing reaches its highest meaning when we develop a completely nonharming attitude and continually wish for the well-being of other living beings.
We practice Skillful Action not because we want to avoid breaking the Buddha’s rules or because we fear that someone will punish us if we do.
We avoid cruel and hurtful behavior because we see the consequences of such actions—that they lead to profound unhappiness for us and for everyone around us, now and in the future.
We practice Skillful Action because we want our lives to be helpful and harmonious, not destructive and contentious, and because we want a calm and happy mind, untroubled by regret or remorse.
Our mind plays many tricks on us when it comes to observing moral principles.
Some people tell themselves that moral rules do not apply to the young.
Unfortunately, observing moral principles at the end of life is like winning the lottery on your deathbed.
If you wait too long, you won’t be able to enjoy the benefits that a moral life brings—freedom from addictions, healthy relationships, a clear conscience, and an untroubled mind.
It’s best to enjoy the wholesome effects of morality while you’re young, healthy, and strong.
In old age, you won’t need moral principles to keep you from misbehaving !
If this is your response, you’d best look at your reasoning carefully.
Moreover, these behaviors inevitably lead to negative consequences.
There’s no running away from the law of cause and effect.
Break moral principles, and you risk losing your health, your property, the affection of your loved ones, and many other things you value.
Moreover, you’ll face worry, guilt, and even more dissatisfaction.
Remember, we observe moral principles to make us happy, not miserable.
Even small, seemingly trivial immoral acts have some impact.
As they talked, an insect landed on the edge of the businessman’s beer glass.
He pushed it down into the beer with a little stirring stick.
When the bug crawled back up the glass the man pushed it down again.
While discussing business worth millions of dollars, he toyed with the bug, repeatedly pushing it down until it drowned.
So he backed out of the deal.
You might wonder why the principles of Skillful Action are expressed in negative terms—not killing, not stealing, and the like.
The reason for this is very simple.
We cannot find the joy of good behavior until we let go of the wrong.
We tend to act with a mind filled with attachment, which leads us to all kinds of depravity.
First we must oppose this natural tendency.
Then we can see how comfortable, relaxed, free, and peaceful we feel when we act ethically.
It’s impossible to cook a delicious meal in a pot caked with dirt, or to grow a beautiful garden on land choked with weeds.
Abstaining from the negative, we create the proper conditions for the positive to flourish.
For instance, refraining from killing or other acts of active hostility creates the right atmosphere for loving-friendliness and compassion to enter our dealings with others.
Similarly, abstaining from stealing—taking what is not given, whether it is someone else’s possessions or credit for someone else’s work or ideas—gives rise to its opposite, generosity.
Ethical action shifts our focus from what we personally want to what will most benefit us and others.
When we are obsessed with our own desires, we are motivated primarily by hatred, greed, envy, lust, and other selfish preoccupations.
Then we have neither the self-control nor the wisdom to act rightly.
But when we abstain from negativity, our mental fog clears a bit, and we begin to see that loving-friendliness, compassion, and generosity genuinely make us happy.
This clarity of mind helps us to make ethical choices and to progress on the Buddha’s path.
Not Killing
The inclination to harm or hurt other living beings generally arises out of hatred or fear.
When we purposely kill living beings, even small creatures like insects, we diminish our respect for all life—and thus for ourselves.
Mindfulness helps us to recognize our own aversions and to take responsibility for them.
As we examine our mental states, we see that hatred and fear lead to a cycle of cruelty and violence, actions that damage others and destroy our own peace of mind.
Abstaining from killing makes the mind peaceful and free from hatred.
This clarity helps us to refrain from destructive actions and to embrace actions motivated by generosity and compassion.
One of my students told me that she used to feel fear and revulsion toward certain small creatures, like mice, fleas, and ticks.
Because of these feelings, she was willing to kill them.
As her mindfulness practice helped her to become more gentle, she resolved not to kill these creatures.
As a result, her feelings of fear and revulsion diminished.
Not long ago, she even managed to scoop up a large cockroach in her bare hands and carry it outdoors to safety.
When we abstain from killing, our respect for life grows, and we begin to act with compassion toward all living beings.
This same student told me of visiting a friend who lived at a certain meditation center.
When she arrived, she noticed an insect trap hung up on the porch of the center’s staff housing.
Dozens of yellow jackets were in the trap, drawn by the sweet smell of apple juice.
Once they entered the small opening in the trap, they could not get out.
When they became exhausted by flying in the small space, they fell into the apple juice at the bottom of the trap and slowly drowned.
The visiting student asked her friend about the trap.
He agreed that such a device was a shameful thing to have at a meditation center, but he said that the higher-ups had put the trap there and that there was nothing he could do about it.
Though she tried to ignore the buzzing coming from the trap, the woman could not get the suffering of the yellow jackets out of her mind.
Soon she felt she had to do something to give a few of them a chance to escape.
She took a knife, poked a tiny hole at the top of the trap, and inserted the knife to hold it open.
A few yellow jackets crawled up the knife blade and escaped to safety.
Then she enlarged the hole a bit more, and a few more got out.
Finally, she realized that she could not bear to leave even one to die in the trap.
Though she was nervous about interfering, she took the trap to a nearby field and cut it completely open, releasing all the yellow jackets that remained alive.
As she did so, she made the wish, “May I be released from my negative attitudes and behaviors even as these insects are released from the trap.”
The student told me that since that time, she has had no fear of yellow jackets.
Last spring, a nest of yellow jackets appeared under the main doorway of the Bhavana Society.
People using that doorway got stung, and the area was roped off.
However, this one woman continued to use that doorway, stepping over the nest without harm until it was removed.
“I’ll be very surprised if I’m ever stung by yellow jackets again,” she said.
“But if I do get stung, I’ll be more worried about the poor yellow jacket who gets upset and may get injured by stinging me.
As you can see from this student’s experience, refraining from killing creates the right atmosphere for compassionate action to grow in our lives.
This is wonderful and a great aid to progress on the Buddha’s path.
Take the issue of eating meat.
Though I do not eat meat myself, I do not insist that everyone become a vegetarian.
Looking at the bigger picture, I see that even vegetarians contribute indirectly to killing.
Suppose there is a village where a thousand vegetarians live, and in the next village, there is a farmer who cultivates vegetables, fruit, and grain to feed the thousand villagers.
When he tills the land or controls the insects that might damage the vegetables, the farmer kills many small beings.
Many other animals and insects are killed by his farm machinery as he harvests the crop.
The vegetarians in the next village feel very comfortable.
Even though creatures did die, the vegetarians have a clear conscience when eating, because they lack the intent to kill.
You can see from this example that eating vegetables and killing beings in the process of growing vegetables are two separate things.
The same logic applies to eating meat.
Eating meat and killing beings for their meat are two separate things.
The Buddha himself sometimes ate meat that was offered to him.
Those who are merely eating meat also lack the intent to kill.
For the purpose of keeping the precept against killing, the Buddha defined killing very specifically as the act of purposely taking life.
In the rules he set down for monks, the Buddha further clarifies the conditions necessary for an act of killing:
There must be a being.
You must know that there is a being.
You must intend to kill.
You must plan to use a method to kill the being.
You must kill the being, using only the planned method.
Meat-eaters do not fulfill any of these conditions.
They know that what they are eating is meat and that the meat came from some animal.
But they should also not become neurotic trying to avoid everything that contributes indirectly to killing.
When we think about it, a certain amount of indirect contribution to killing can be found in most contemporary lives.
Even driving a car or walking across the lawn kills beings.
Various types of medicines we use have been tested on animals—killing them, maiming them, or making them sick.
Benefiting from these medicines is not killing.
The Buddha said very clearly that your intention is what really counts.
As far as spiritual progress is concerned, there is no difference between vegetarians and nonvegetarians.
When vegetarians get angry or become greedy or confused, they behave the same way that people who eat meat do.
If you want to be a vegetarian, by all means do so.
Vegetarian meals are very healthy.
I personally remain vegetarian out of compassion to animals.
However, do not feel obligated to avoid eating meat in order to reach your goal of highest happiness.
Many laypeople ask me how to deal with insect pests in their homes and gardens.
They want to be good Buddhists and not kill, but their flowers will wither or their homes deteriorate if they ignore the insects.
I tell them that killing insects, even for a good reason, is still killing.
However, not all killing has the same kammic consequences.
Killing an insect generally does not hinder one’s progress as much as killing an animal, such as a dog.
Killing a dog causes less impact to the mind than killing a human being.
No act of killing causes more harm to oneself than killing one’s parents or killing an enlightened being.
This kind of killing would prevent the killer from attaining enlightenment in this life and lead to the worst kind of rebirth.
Killing insects is not so grave a matter as this.
Understanding that there are differing levels of impact, we make our choices and accept the consequences.
Not Stealing
Stealing is an expression of our greed or envy.
Taking what does not belong to us is a bad habit that is hard to break.
Some people are so undisciplined in this area that even when they attend a meditation training course to try to gain some peace and happiness, they continue their stealing habit.
At the Bhavana Society, we know of incidents of people stealing meditation cushions.
Because the Bhavana Society is located in a forest without quick access to any major collection of Buddhist books, we maintain our own collection.
Over time, some books have disappeared.
Isn’t it ironic that people who come to the center to meditate and study the Buddha’s teachings can’t see that taking things that do not belong to them can never help them toward an untroubled mind?
Practicing the Skillful Action of not stealing means making an effort to be honest and to respect the property of others.
It means pointing out the error to a clerk in a store who has forgotten to charge you for something that you have bought or who has given you too much change.
It means going out of your way to return what is not yours, with no expectation of being rewarded for your actions.
Of course, sometimes honesty does lead to material rewards.
I remember a news account of two boys who found a bag full of money in the bathroom of a Sears store.
It turned out that the money belonged to a man who had stopped at the store to use the rest room on his way to depositing the money in a bank.
When he was able to identify the bag and the amount of money it contained, the man’s property was returned to him.
Imagine how he suffered when he discovered that the money was missing and how grateful he felt when it was returned.
His belief in justice and in human goodness must have risen.
He expressed his gratitude by giving the boys a generous reward, and the community honored them for their honesty.
It’s easy to see that taking someone’s property or money is stealing, but we are often confronted with more subtle occasions to steal.
Taking credit for someone else’s ideas is also stealing.
So is lifting small items from the office, such as pens, notebooks, or computer disks, and taking them home for your personal use.
Cheating on your income taxes, writing bad checks, taking bribes, and engaging in fraudulent business practices are also stealing.
Even shoplifting groceries when you are hungry constitutes theft.
Remember, it is never good to feed the body at the expense of the mind.
Our purpose in practicing the moral guidelines of Skillful Action is to make our lives happy.
If we break them, misery is sure to follow, in this life or in the future.
Happiness requires peace of mind and a clear conscience.
Do not think that you are refraining from stealing to please the world.
You are doing so for your own contentment, now and in the future.
As we go beyond the coarse level of struggling against any form of stealing, we begin to refine our consideration for others’ needs and become less self-centered in the way we regard material things.
Using the rule against stealing as a guide, we become less envious of other people’s possessions or good fortune.
Instead we discover appreciative joy and rejoice in other peoples’ happiness.
The Buddha’s words usually translated as abstaining from “sexual misconduct” actually apply to more than just sexual behavior.
The words that he used literally mean that one should abstain from “abuse of the senses”—all the senses.
For the purpose of keeping precepts, it is traditionally assumed that by “abuse of the senses” the Buddha specifically meant abstention from sexual misconduct.
Sexual misconduct includes rape and manipulating someone into having sex against their wishes.
These definitions aside, people get into lot of trouble because of their sexual desires.
The irony is that lust can never be completely satisfied.
No matter how many risks people take or how much pain and suffering people go though to try to fulfill their desires, the wish to fulfill desires does not go away.
Some people turn to meditation out of the pain and suffering caused by their sexual desires.
Unfortunately, all too often, even during their efforts to gain some concentration and peace of mind, lust keeps bothering them.
The only solution to this problem is to begin with disciplining your sexual activity.
If you are incapable of a bit of self-discipline, the path to happiness will forever remain elusive.
Some very sincere meditators have made great strides in cleaning up bad habits such as drinking or lying, yet fail to see why they should rein in their sexual behavior.
They say, “I don’t see what’s wrong with having a little fun.”
But cheap thrills cheapen you and degrade your self-worth.
Casual sex hurts you and can injure others.
The Buddha’s second truth tells us that all suffering stems from desire.
Confused sexual behavior is one of the easiest ways to trap the mind into a cycle of craving and aversion.
Sexual pleasures are so alluring, and their downsides—rejection, embarrassment, frustration, jealousy, insecurity, remorse, loneliness, and craving for more—are so unbearable that they keep people running on an endless treadmill.
The problem is that lust cannot be eased by fulfilling it physically.
Doing so is like scratching a poison ivy rash.
Though scratching may bring a brief sense of relief, it spreads the poison and makes the underlying problem worse.
Curing your condition requires restraint, holding back from doing things that will intensify your discomfort later.
The Buddha used a powerful metaphor to illustrate the common mistakes people make in thinking about sexuality.
In his day, lepers could be seen gathered around fires, burning their wounds.
Their disease gave them the most unbearable itching.
Applying fire to their sores gave them some relief.
But the fire did not heal their wounds or cure their disease.
Instead, they burned themselves.
Once the feeling of temporary ease left them, the sores swelled and festered from the burns.
The poor sufferers were left with even more discomfort and itching than before.
So, the lepers went back to the fire and burned themselves again.
People do the same thing when they seek relief from their lust, the Buddha said.
When they go to the fire of sexual indulgence, they get a temporary sense of release from the pain and dissatisfaction of their sexual desire.
Then how much more maddening is the craving, the itching?
Now imagine, the Buddha continued, that a great physician comes along and brings healing medicine to a leper.
The leper applies the medicine and is fully cured.
His former companions call to him to join them around the fire and to burn himself again.
The healed leper remembers what that was like—the insanity of the craving and the short-lived release of the fire.
Nothing can make him go back to it.
He feels great compassion for his former companions and for his own previous suffering.
Of all the medicines in the world,
Manifold and various,
There is none like the medicine of Dhamma.
Therefore, O monks, drink of this.
Having drunk this Dhamma medicine,
You will be ageless and beyond death.
Having developed and seen the truth,
You will be quenched, free from craving.
In fact, a supportive relationship can be a great asset to progress through the Buddha’s eight steps to happiness.
Abstention from sexual misconduct can be kept in a more and more refined way, far beyond the technical abstention of the precept.
At its highest level, you view all women as your sisters, all men as your brothers, older people as your parents, and younger people as your children.
Lust disappears.
You simply do not see people in that way anymore.
Any predatory attitude is gone, and even subtle lust disappears into open-hearted compassion and concern for others’ well-being.
Moreover, to perfect the step of Skillful Action, the Buddha urged us to stop abusing any of our senses.
These kinds of activities are not right for the body and not right for a spiritual path.
The self-centeredness rooted in these activities can melt away, leaving room for a spirited, generous heart, no longer a slave to craving’s call.
Not Using Intoxicants
The last of the five precepts says to avoid alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicants, and the same principle is implied in Skillful Action.
In giving this precept, the Buddha used conditional wording.
He did not tell lay followers to avoid all intoxicants, but only those that cause “negligence, infatuation, and heedlessness.”
In other words, the careful use of painkilling drugs and other narcotics prescribed by a doctor does not violate the prohibition.
Nor does occasional, light use of alcohol, such as a glass of wine.
We must use common sense.
Though light use of alcohol may be allowed, it is inadvisable.
One drink tends to lead to another.
Some people with sensitivity to alcohol may lose control and drink to excess after just one drink.
Thus, the most effective time to exercise control is before that first drink, not after.
Others develop an addictive habit more slowly, drinking a little more each time, unaware that their casual use of alcohol is becoming a serious problem.
Moreover, the presence of alcohol in the house may tempt people to get drunk impulsively during a time of stress or sorrow.
We can live quite healthily without alcohol, and it is better not to give it a chance to ruin our lives.
Over the years I have heard many stories of how alcohol leads to unhappiness.
For instance, a resident at the Bhavana Society told me that many years ago she was indifferent to alcohol and drank only a little when others insisted.
She just carried the bottle around all evening to fit in with those who were drinking.
After graduating from college, she moved to another community.
Her new friends drank frequently, and she developed a casual social drinking habit, which increased slowly.
She told me that one night, when she was in a very bad mood, she drank one kind of hard drink and then another.
When her friends expressed surprise at her having more than one drink, she swore at them, telling them to mind their own business.
Suddenly, a strange feeling went through her body.
Later she realized that it must have been a chemical change.
From that moment on, she craved alcohol.
Within two years she was drinking every day and getting drunk several times a week.
Her personality changed in negative ways, and she suffered a great deal of unhappiness.
Eventually, she sought help through an alcohol recovery program and now has been sober for many years.
People use intoxicants for many reasons.
Young people want to feel more grown-up or sophisticated; shy or nervous people want to relax or feel more sociable; troubled people want to forget their problems.
All of these motivations arise from dissatisfaction—from wanting to escape the reality of what is happening in the present moment.
Yet, when we think about it, running away never solved any problem or relieved any kind of suffering.
Addiction to alcohol or drugs only makes your suffering worse.
It can cause you to lose your sense of decency, your moral principles, your inhibitions.
You may lie, commit sexual misconduct, steal, or worse.
You may ruin your health, wealth, marriage, family, job, business.
You may lose the respect of others and your respect for yourself.
In the end you are left wallowing in misery and wondering why all these bad things happen to you.
All in all, the best cure for addiction to intoxicants is not to use them in the first place!
For the purpose of the Eightfold Path, we can look beyond the words of the fifth precept to see what higher level of meaning we can find in abstaining from intoxicants.
Everyone should follow the five precepts every day.
But people who want to progress more quickly on the Buddhist path may commit to a more comprehensive set of training rules for a period of time.
These rules include the five basic precepts and a few more rigorous restrictions.
There are eight traditional training precepts:
not eating after midday
not dancing, singing, indulging in music, or watching shows, and not using perfumes, cosmetics, or adornments
not using high and large beds or seats
Observing the eight precepts from time to time can help improve your meditation practice.
When your conscience is clear and you have no reason for remorse, your concentration grows stronger.
In ancient times, people in Buddhist countries observed these eight training precepts for a day four times a month, on every quarter phase of the moon.
They spent the day meditating in a monastery or temple, reading Buddhist books, and listening to the Buddha’s message and discussing it.
Sometimes they made a pilgrimage from one temple or religious site to another.
Wherever they assembled, they meditated or listened to a talk by a learned layperson or monk.
The next day they resumed their regular activities.
Nowadays very few people practice this religious observance.
When we get tired of all these activities, we take a vacation.
We may have worked very hard to save money for this vacation, which often consists of another frantic round of pleasure-seeking activities.
Perhaps you recognize this trap of suffering.
The eight precepts of Buddhist training offer an alternative.
Taking the eight training precepts for a day, a weekend, or longer can give you a genuine break from your ordinary routine and leave you refreshed and clearheaded, not hungover, tired, and crabby.
You don’t have to go to a temple to take the eight precepts.
You can undertake them privately in your home.
The immediate benefits of observing the temporary precepts are a sense of peace, contentment, and relaxation, as well as improved health and the prospect of an unconfused death.
Occasional discipline soothes and comforts both body and mind.
For instance, people who generally eat three or four meals a day may find that fasting one day a week is a very good practice.
They can start by eating only two meals and fasting for the rest of the day.
These two meals should be a good breakfast and a light lunch.
They should skip the evening meal.
Since there are not too many activities after a heavy meal in the evening, the digestive process is very slow, and food stays in the stomach until the next morning.
When you do not eat anything at night, you feel quite hungry the next morning.
Then you can eat a good breakfast.
Perhaps on most days, your family’s needs and your work schedule do not allow you to eat well early in the day and lightly at night.
Taking a special day to keep the eight precepts gives you a chance to try this style of eating.
The time you save in the evening when you don’t have to cook, eat, and clean up from a big meal can be used to do many beneficial things, like meditating or reading a book on the Buddha’s message.
Though this practice is not very easy at first, it is a wonderful habit to cultivate.
Remember, nothing is very easy at first.
After you get used to not eating so much, you can also try fasting for a full day.
Do not eat any solid food, but do drink plenty of water and fruit juice.
Spend the day by yourself, reading and meditating.
This mini-vacation is a wonderful break for the body and mind.
Taking the eight precepts in a formal way reminds you to be mindful.
When you start to do something that would violate one of the precepts, your mind will say, “Just a minute, remember…!” and you will recall, “Oh, I’m not supposed to …” The precept operates like the light touch of a whip that a buggy driver uses to remind the horse to stay on course, or the beep of a car’s horn that reminds a driver to stay in his lane.
Laypeople can also make a commitment to a set of training rules called the eight lifetime precepts.
This set of principles is made up of the five basic precepts plus three additional rules regarding Skillful Speech: not engaging in malicious speech, not speaking harshly, and not speaking frivolously.
The suggestion came from one of our board members who wanted take these precepts herself.
Candidates were asked to attend a two-day retreat just prior to the ceremony to focus on the meaning of the vows.
The response to this invitation was heartening.
Thirty-six people attended the retreat, took lifetime refuge in the Buddha, and received the eight lifetime precepts.
We have offered this opportunity each year since then.
Preparing for the vow ceremony was very difficult for some of the candidates.
Many expressed some fear, and some experienced a lot of resistance.
The candidates recited the verses together as a group.
Then each received a new name in the ancient language of Pali.
This simple ceremony had a beautiful effect on peoples’ lives, especially on the way they spoke.
After taking the vows, they found that if harsh or frivolous words slipped out, they would notice immediately how silly it is to speak in such a way.
The precept made them stop, like a sudden tug in the mind.
The next time, they found, the words would not even slip out.
This simple shift helped them to see how precepts work to create happiness.
Many of these people have written to thank me for these precepts.
They say it was a turning point in their lives.
They volunteered.
They did not take these vows for me, or for other people, or for their spouses or kids, or because of a law, or for the world.
They made the vow to observe these training rules for themselves, for their own lives, and for their present and future happiness.
You should not be afraid to make the commitment to practice the principles of Skillful Action or to take either the eight training precepts or the eight lifetime precepts.
You should rejoice that you have determined to take steps to make your life happy.
People who are addicted to alcohol, drugs, gambling, or some other unwholesome activity have a very hard time deciding to stop.
They drag their feet and come up with many excuses.
But once they have made the commitment to change and have maintained that discipline for a period of time, they find they are thinking clearly, eating well, saving money, and developing good relations with their families and other people.
Then they are grateful and congratulate themselves for taking this positive step.
In the same way, we may have difficulty making the commitment to abandon unwholesome behavior.
But once we have done so and have worked at it consistently, we will be happy, very glad to have made a decision that brings such improvement to our lives.
The Buddha said, “All wholesome words, deeds, and thoughts have mindfulness as their root.”
In other words, Skillful Action grows naturally out of mindfulness.
Let’s look more closely at why this is so.
Every intentional action of body, speech, or mind impacts us strongly.
When we hurt someone or commit some other negative action, we often suffer physical stress and develop a confused, unhappy state of mind.
Mindfulness helps us to see this harmful impact clearly.
We see that an unwholesome action leads to feelings of remorse, which leads to worry, which prevents the mind from becoming calm.
When the mind is agitated, we lose the ability to concentrate.
The more negative our action, the more upset and worried we feel.
A vicious cycle begins, in which negative states of mind influence us to engage in other unwholesome actions.
With mindfulness, we see that when we act with loving-friendliness, our mind becomes peaceful and relaxed.
A peaceful mind enhances our joy and helps us concentrate more deeply.
Realizing this, we feel encouraged to pursue wholesome actions.
We become healthier physically and mentally.
This positive feedback keeps us moving in a good direction.
An unclouded mind makes your face bright and radiant.
When you think of your good actions, you feel delighted.
This delight shines in your eyes and your expressions.
People feel drawn to someone who looks this way.
When we are mindful of Skillful Action, our unclouded mind also helps us focus on every passing moment, but not in a dull, passive way.
We bring all of our skills and intelligence to the task of knowing both what is going on in our minds and how well we are interacting with the world around us.
In this way we develop a comprehensive awareness of our actions.
Such mindfulness is especially crucial when others test our patience.
It’s relatively easy to observe the precepts and act harmoniously so long as no one provokes you.
But if someone says something that angers or hurts you, your mind may be sent spinning for a moment.
I better not say or do anything I’ll regret.
If you stay mindfully aware of the whole context of every interaction, you will also remember to be extra careful when you are vulnerable.
If you are grieving the loss of someone or something you love, for instance, it may take less provocation to make you angry.
You know, then, to be especially careful around other people, like a man without shoes walking softly where there may be glass.
This is important, too, when you are ill, tired, hungry, lonely, in pain, or just plain grouchy.
When you are under stress, moment-to-moment mindfulness helps you remember your vulnerability and avoid regrettable actions.
Another time when you must be especially mindful is when you find yourself in a situation in which your past habits may tempt you to violate a moral principle.
A person who once found it easy to steal must immediately become mindful when someone’s wallet lies within easy reach.
A former drinker must snap to attention when free beer is being passed around.
When a married man who has struggled with lust is handed a business card by a woman who flirts with him, he must say to himself, “If I take this phone number, it will result in temptation.
My peace of mind will be affected.
I love my wife and don’t want to jeopardize my family.
I’ve taken other people’s cards today, but I had better pass on this one or throw it away immediately.
Until you are enlightened and your mind is fully trained, many other kinds of wrong actions will occasionally occur to you.
Before doing anything you know to be wrong, you should step back and reflect mindfully on how this action might hurt you.
For example, if you feel tempted to steal money from your employer, you can examine the consequences: You will live in fear of being caught.
If you are caught, you will certainly lose your job, your reputation, and perhaps your freedom as well.
Even if you are not caught by the law, your conscience will catch you immediately.
But once you put it into action, you will never live in peace.
You should also weigh the brief pleasure a wrongful action may yield against the lasting suffering it brings.
Say you feel tempted to hit someone.
This intent may come with the belief that you will feel satisfied afterward: “I’ve done my job,” you’ll be able to say, “and this guy won’t try that again!” But you can’t predict results so precisely.
The man may become furious and hit back harder.
He may develop a grudge and plan secretly to attack you.
One wrong deed can lead to a long and bitter quarrel.
I knew a man in Sri Lanka who had a long-standing quarrel with his neighbors.
To get back at them, he built a primitive outhouse close to the property line, right beside his neighbors’ well.
The neighbors complained, asking him to remove the privy, but he refused.
One by one the neighbors fell sick.
The fighting between the two families escalated, until someone committed a murder.
The police became involved, and I think that this man ended up in jail.
Both families were devastated.
There are a billion such quarrels.
If we find ourselves in such a dispute, we must cease immediately and try to smooth things over.
Quarrels that get out of hand hurt everyone involved.
Skillful Action is not something invented by the Buddha.
It is universally true that wrong actions cause suffering and perpetuate hatred.
As the Buddha expressed this idea:
Hatred is never overcome by hatred.
Only through loving-friendliness does hatred cease.
This is an eternal law.
The Buddha did not claim credit for this law.
It does not belong to Buddhists only or to anyone else.
In his enlightened state, the Buddha could see clearly the negative consequences that inevitably arise from wrong action.
If you “act or speak with a defiled state of mind,” he said, “suffering will follow you as surely as the cart wheel follows the foot of the ox.”
Skillful Action not only soothes your mind but has a positive effect on everyone around you.
I once heard a story of a monk who demonstrated how mindfulness of Skillful Action helps others.
The temple where the monk lived had a jackfruit tree that was bearing fruit.
Jackfruit is very useful for a monastery.
Each fruit is very large, with a big seed that is full of protein and a thick flesh that can be cooked in many ways.
Poor families who lack other food can live on jackfruit.
Though jackfruit does not cost much at the market, stealing jackfruit from trees in a poor area has been known to provoke murder.
One night the monk noticed a thief in the temple’s jackfruit tree.
The thief was high up in the branches of the tree, lowering each fruit by means of a string so that it would not clunk on the ground and draw attention.
The thief looped the string around the fruit in such a way that when the fruit touched the ground, the string would loosen.
Then the thief would pull the string up for the next fruit.
The monk went to stand quietly beneath the tree.
As each fruit touched the ground, he helped to loosen the string.
Eventually the thief came down as well.
He nearly fainted at the sight of the cheerful monk standing there.
Then let your faulty actions go.
Feeling guilty or worrying about consequences beyond your control cannot help you.
Regard your past transgressions with the same generous and compassionate attitude that the monk showed to the jackfruit thief.
When you react in this way, you will redouble your efforts to practice Skillful Action.
Anyone interested in spiritual progress should follow five precepts of abstention from killing, stealing, false speech, sexual misconduct, and using drugs or alcohol.
Eating meat does not fit the definition of killing.
Killing requires intent, knowledge, planning, and carrying out that plan.
When we don’t kill, we can become truly harmless and practice loving-friendliness.
Stealing means taking anything not given, including others’ ideas.
When we don’t steal, we can develop respect for the needs of others and practice appreciative joy.
The precept against sexual misconduct includes rape, manipulating someone into having sex against their wishes, and sex with minors, animals, someone’s spouse, or someone protected by parents or guardians; it also includes breaking trust in a relationship.
When we avoid sexual misconduct, troublesome lust can be abated.
We should avoid all deliberate abuse of our senses.
This helps us let go of our greed, and in this way, we develop a generous spirit toward others.
Addiction to alcohol or drugs may come on quickly or may be a gradually conditioned behavior; it causes great harm, and it is best to avoid getting started.
When we abstain from intoxicants we can maintain a clear mind and work to remove our delusions.
We can develop mindfulness and learn to act in accordance with reality.
Taking additional precepts, either the eight training precepts or the eight lifetime precepts, can be a great aid to concentration and to furthering progress on the Buddha’s path.
Mindfulness can help us to overcome temptation, avoid quarrels, and respond compassionately to others’ moral failings as well as our own.
STEP 5 - Skillful Livelihood
A STUDENT OF MINE told me about a shrewd businesswoman who practices Buddhist principles.
Once when she was looking to make a new investment, some liquor stores came up for sale.
She knew that if she bought them, she could expect an excellent profit.
Yet something prevented her.
As she reflected on the business of selling liquor, she realized that some of the customers at the stores might be harmed.
To protect her spiritual growth, she backed out of the deal.
This little story illustrates a powerful truth: Our means of sustenance should not interfere with our spiritual development.
We cannot come up with a complete list of occupations that constitute Skillful Livelihood, but the Buddha did give us a basic guideline: Any job can be Skillful Livelihood so long as it does not cause harm to the person doing the job or to someone else.
Of course, until we are enlightened, no job will be perfect.
The only truly perfect livelihood is a job performed by a person who is perfected—someone who has eradicated completely all greed, hatred, and delusion.
But those of us on the path toward perfection can still do much to harmonize our working life and our spiritual life.
As with most questions of Buddhist ethics, the rationale behind Skillful Livelihood is twofold.
Working at a job that harms others is wrong in itself because it violates moral principles.
But such a job is also wrong because it harms us.
Since we are not enlightened, we cannot completely avoid agitation and suffering.
Things happen at work that cause us to struggle with greed and aversion.
But we can avoid jobs that obstruct our spiritual progress.
If our job causes excessive agitation, our mind cannot calm down enough to meditate.
Let’s look at an obvious example.
Say a man’s job requires him to kill animals.
He might be a researcher who tests new drugs on laboratory mice.
Or he might be a commercial fisherman or a hog butcher.
When the man comes to meditate, his mind may be troubled.
Daily he sees living creatures suffering because of what he does.
He sees the fear in their eyes and their struggles to escape; he hears their squeals and their bleats of pain.
These images stay with him when he goes home.
In order to do his job, he must pretend to himself that animals do not have feelings, that they are not really living beings like himself.
In his heart, he knows that these thoughts are untrue, but he continues to kill because that is his job.
This inner struggle causes disturbing thoughts and images to arise during his meditation.
He cannot practice loving-friendliness; he cannot even relax.
Clearly this man’s job cannot be Skillful Livelihood.
It’s easy to see that some occupations, like killing animals, are inherently disturbing.
Some jobs might be acceptable in some workplaces and not in others depending on circumstances, such as whether the boss asks employees to act immorally.
A three-tiered inquiry will help us decide whether a job qualifies as Skillful Livelihood.
You can determine whether a job is suitable to be Skillful Livelihood by asking yourself three interrelated questions.
First, is my job an inherently wrong occupation?
Many jobs clearly fall into this category.
For example, research and development of chemical and biological weapons, manufacturing or selling insecticides, designing computer guidance systems for missiles and profiting from sweatshop labor are clearly wrong.
I would add that writing for a tabloid newspaper that harms the reputations of public figures or working for a radio talk show that broadcasts hateful speech should be considered among the “poisons” the Buddha mentioned as wrong livelihood.
We also have to extend the Buddha’s guidance beyond its traditional applications.
Making a living from certain violent sports in which people are hurt, such as boxing, is wrong livelihood.
So is owning or working for a casino or other gambling establishment.
Like alcohol, gambling can be addictive.
It is motivated by greed and often leads to crime or hurts the innocent.
Needless to say, criminal activity of any kind is also wrong livelihood, including black-market or other illegal transactions, fraud, extortion, and white-collar crime.
Damaging your own health on the job is also wrong livelihood.
Selling drugs falls under the category of dealing in “poisons.
” Drug traffickers are notorious for violent and corrupt actions to protect territories, enforce deals, and avoid prosecution.
Moreover, the weak and vulnerable people who buy and use the drugs are undoubtedly harmed by them.
Drug users commit crimes to get money.
Innocent family members also suffer: from domestic abuse, from lack of food money, and from grief when the drug user is jailed or hurt.
However, because our economic system has become so complex, sometimes the determination of what constitutes wrong livelihood is not so clear-cut.
If the job puts the person in a position to use weapons, including using a computer to launch missiles, it is probably wrong livelihood.
But being a medic or a cook might not be inherently wrong.
I doubt that the cook in the mess hall ever thinks, “I want to feed these soldiers so they can go and kill!”
Many other job situations come to mind.
A university professor might feel uncomfortable doing basic scientific research because the results could be used by the military.
Or, a steelworker might manufacture the raw material used to make hunting rifles.
Second, does my job lead me to break the five moral precepts?
If an occupation passes the first level of inquiry, then consider whether working in the job encourages you to break any of the five precepts of Skillful Action.
For instance, in one law firm, attorneys may be urged to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct.
In another, attorneys may feel pressured to destroy evidence, deceive juries, or bill excessive hours to clients.
Committing such immoral actions on the job causes the mind to become agitated and hinders a person’s spiritual progress.
I remember an attorney who used to come to the Bhavana Society.
He would cry and cry when he tried to meditate.
I always wondered whether he was so troubled because he did wrong things to win his cases in court.
It is also the case that an otherwise excellent job situation can become wrong livelihood for an individual who chooses to act in a corrupt way.
For example, someone who gives behind-the-wheel road tests before issuing drivers’ licenses may work with integrity, refusing bribes.
Another person with the same job in the same office may be blatantly corrupt.
The corrupt worker does not have Skillful Livelihood, but the honest one may.
Any good job or profession can be made corrupt.
I knew a doctor in Malaysia who issued sick leave certificates for workers to give to their employers; he charged about five dollars for a day off.
The doctor was so in the habit of doing this that when a patient entered his office, the first question he would ask was, “How many days?”
A famous story about the Buddha and his evil-minded cousin, the powerful monk Devadatta, tells of two people working in the same profession, only one of whom follows Skillful Livelihood:
According to folklore, the future Devadatta first conceived a grudge against the Buddha in a past life, when the honest business practices of the Bodhisatta—the future Buddha—caused the unscrupulous Devadatta to lose out in a business deal.
In that past life, the future Devadatta and the Bodhisatta were rival peddlers traveling together selling pots and pans.
At each town, they would divide the streets between them to decide who would approach each house first.
The women did not guess its value.
When Devadatta appeared at their door, the daughter asked her mother to trade the bowl for a trinket.
The greedy Devadatta quickly saw that the bowl was worth a fortune but decided to deceive the poor women.
He declared that the bowl was worthless, tossed it on the floor, and left, intending to return later and offer them virtually nothing for it.
Sometime later, when the Bodhisatta appeared at the same door, the women asked him with some hesitation to trade the bowl for a trinket.
The honest Bodhisatta told them the bowl’s worth and said that he was unable to pay them even a small fraction of its value.
The women were delighted and greatly respected the Bodhisatta for his honesty.
They asked him please just to give them what he could.
So he gave them all his money and all his pots and pans.
Taking the golden bowl, the Bodhisatta hastened to the river crossing, for he guessed what Devadatta intended to do.
Soon after the Bodhisatta left, Devadatta returned to the women’s house.
As he approached, the elder woman rushed at him, crying out that he had tried to deceive them.
She told him that the other peddler had been honest with them and had paid them well.
Realizing his loss, Devadatta cried out and became like one deranged.
He ripped his clothes, threw aside all his goods, and chased after the Bodhisatta, crying out that the Bodhisatta had stolen his golden bowl.
When he reached the river, he saw the Bodhisatta halfway across, being rowed by the boatsman.
He yelled at him to stop, but the Bodhisatta quietly instructed the boatman to pay no attention, and they went on.
As he gazed at the Bodhisatta’s receding figure, Devadatta was filled with hatred and sorrow.
Hot blood gushed from his mouth.
His heart split, and he fell down dead.
Thus was Devadatta ruined by his own dishonest business practices.
The Bodhisatta became wealthy from the sale of the golden bowl for which he had bartered honestly.
He spent his life in charity and good deeds.
When he died, his honesty sent him onward to good future lives, until he eventually attained Bud-dhahood.
Devadatta’s deeds also propelled him into appropriate future lives.
He continued to be the Buddha’s rival.
In the Buddha’s final lifetime, after the Buddha’s enlightenment, Devadatta even tried to assassinate the Buddha.
It is said that the earth opened up and he fell into hell.
Finally, are there other aspects of my job that disturb me and keep my mind from settling down?
If an occupation passes the first two levels of inquiry, then you need to consider what other factors might impede your spiritual progress.
This can be complicated.
Since no work situation is perfect, we each have to decide for ourselves what constitutes an insurmountable problem.
In my opinion, the best way to determine whether a job qualifies as Skillful Livelihood is to gauge its effect on the mind.
Imagine that a company dumps toxins into a river and causes great harm to fish and other wildlife.
Later the employees learn about the dumping.
Two of these employees are interested in practicing Skillful Livelihood.
Must they quit working for the company?
One employee is filled with loathing over what happened.
In his mind, he goes over and over the images from a television news report about the incident.
He thinks about the unwholesome qualities of the people who made the decision and mentally argues his side of the story with imaginary accusers.
The other employee goes about her job with a feeling of compassion for all those affected, including the people responsible for the decision.
She continues to hope that company officials will come to see that such actions are wrong and take steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
These thoughts do not disturb her mind.
Some people might argue that both employees must quit because they work for an immoral company.
Others might say only the employee who is filled with unwholesome thoughts must quit, due to the negative influence of these working conditions on his mind.
We must use our common sense and our understanding of the Buddha’s teachings to figure out what’s right.
Moral principals do count.
We know that indifference to moral outrage is also immoral.
If we say to ourselves, “What I do makes no difference, and besides, what happened does not really affect me personally,” we cut us ourselves off from the world.
So we have a responsibility to stand up for what is right.
But—and this is a very important point—when we do so, we must be careful that we do not revile other people or accuse them hatefully.
Any action that we contemplate, even an action intended to right a terrible wrong, must be motivated by loving, friendly feelings for others and for all beings.
With this in mind, and filled with great compassion, then we act.
Returning to our question of whether the two employees of the polluting company must quit, we cannot jump to a quick decision.
Depending on our mental attitude, quitting may or may not be the right thing to do.
Only one thing is certain: the right thing to do is always to protect and nourish the wholesomeness of one’s own mind.
Indifference to harm is not wholesome.
Yet becoming upset, furious, or hateful is also unwholesome.
Even if we decide that we must leave a job in order to achieve Skillful Livelihood, quitting in a rage does not help us on the path.
Our mind must remain calm, loving, and mindful.
We must always remember that our highest goal is to free our mind from all greed, all hatred, all confusion.
The greatest impact we can have on the world is to face every circumstance with a mind of clarity, compassion, and love.
From a place of calm and equanimity, we act or decline to act, doing whatever most skillfully cultivates and expresses our loving-friendliness and our compassion.
Given this, the best thing for the employees of the polluting company to do is to work with their own minds to find peace.
A sensitive employee only remotely connected to management may feel more upset than a hardened top executive.
If the company’s immoral behavior disturbs an employee and causes restlessness and an inability to concentrate, then the employee surely must take action.
Quitting the job is one option, but there are others as well.
For instance, an employee might take action within the company to stop the wrongdoing, or report the company’s activities to a regulatory authority, or assist the victims, or write probing articles about how companies can prevent such mistakes, or transfer to a more ethical branch of the business.
Disturbances to the mind other than concern about the company’s ethics might also jeopardize Skillful Livelihood.
Perhaps an otherwise ideal situation goes sour for you when a new employee begins to harass you sexually.
Assuming that you can maintain your own integrity in those kinds of difficult environments, you must decide for yourself whether the behavior of your co-workers disturbs your mind and hinders your spiritual progress.
Assessing Skillful Livelihood is an individual thing.
The same situation that locks one person in unwholesome thoughts may provide another person with an opportunity to practice patience and compassion.
Some of you may by now be experiencing a sinking feeling if you recognize that your job does not fulfill Skillful Livelihood.
“What should I do now?” you may wonder.
As I mentioned, you might first try to encourage your company to clean up its act.
If your uncomfortable feeling is due to the behavior of other people in your workplace, do not forget the Buddha’s tool of metta, loving-friendliness.
The hardest hearts can be won with loving-friendliness.
It may be worth trying this approach before you give up on a difficult job site.
Even if your co-workers do not change, your own heart will definitely soften.
Perhaps you will begin to feel kindness and compassion toward people when they do things that previously made you very upset.
Some occupations or situations cannot be salvaged, and we may have to leave.
Sometimes we have to make sacrifices in order to follow the Buddha’s path.
The Buddha himself said that we should not seek prosperity through wrong means:
When, neither for one’s own sake nor for the sake of another,
One wishes not for children, wealth, a kingdom,
Or for prosperity gained by unjust means,
Only then is one virtuous, wise, and righteous.
For those who have valuable skills or good connections, leaving a job or changing professions may be an easy decision, without much sacrifice involved.
Those who have fewer options may feel terrified at the idea of giving up a steady paycheck, especially people who have children to support.
Yet, when it comes to matters of personal integrity, we have to take action.
Then, when you’ve planned all you can, simply make a leap of faith.
That means that when you rely upon what you know in your heart to be true, things work out for your highest happiness.
I have tested this in my own life and always found it to be accurate.
Here is my own story about making a leap of faith into Skillful Livelihood.
Prior to founding the Bhavana Society, I ran a small, well-known temple in Washington, D.C., for about twenty years.
I was established in the community, with a secure position, a strong board of directors, and surrounded by family and friends.
Yet in my heart I had a dream of establishing a residential meditation center, where people could come to learn the Dhamma and practice meditation.
The Buddha repeatedly spoke of learning Dhamma and practicing meditation as being of the utmost importance, yet I saw that many people had nowhere to go where they could stay for a period of time in order to learn to meditate.
My intentions were good and my faith was strong.
In a way, they were right, of course.
Leaving Washington to found a rural retreat center was leaping from a very comfortable position into the unknown.
The land my friend Matthew Flickstein and I found to build our center was deep in the backwoods of West Virginia.
The isolated forest, so calm and peaceful, seemed an ideal environment for teaching Dhamma and meditation.
The land was beautiful, far away from the busy-ness of Washington, but also in a very conservative Christian area and far from our supporters.
The place was completely strange to me, and we began work there not knowing even one person.
Our new society did not have members.
We did not know how we would survive.
My family and my friends worried about how I would eat.
Some also worried for my safety, but I thought that with my good intentions, no matter how conservative the people in the area might be, since I would not be harming them, and I am not against their religion, they would not harm me.
Soon after buying the place, we put up a sign near the road saying, ambitiously, “Dhamma Village.”
When I returned one time to show the place to a friend, someone had covered the letters to read, “Dam Village.”
The next time I came back, the sign was gone.
Despite these kinds of omens and all the obstacles, I plunged further into the project.
There would be no one to come help in an emergency.
My relatives and friends would be in Washington, a hundred miles away.
I cannot tell you how difficult it was in the beginning.
Even my friend who helped me start the center seemed to have his doubts during one very low period.
What protected me was trust in the Dhamma.
My dream was to spread the Dhamma through teaching and writing, without charging people anything.
Even when I was a child and a novice monk, when people offered me gifts in exchange for Dhamma teachings, I would refuse to take them.
When I grew up, I learned that the Buddha prohibited the selling of Dhamma.
“Don’t be a merchant of the Dhamma,” he said.
Slowly, over time, things came together, and we carved a meditation center out of the woods.
Amazing things happened—help arrived from unanticipated sources just when we needed it most, and unexpected connections yielded breakthroughs.
Somehow, we managed to make progress and to grow.
My own experience has taught me that when we follow our heart’s yearning for peace and happiness, and make sacrifices out of integrity and a love for truth, the rewards of Skillful Livelihood will come to us.
I also know, however, that economic conditions can create very difficult choices, especially for those whose education and skills are limited or highly specialized.
A story from the time of the Buddha illustrates this point.
A rich merchant’s daughter who had heard the Dhamma had reached the first stage of enlightenment.
One day, a handsome hunter came through the town selling venison, and the young woman fell in love with him.
Without saying good-bye to her family, she followed the hunter home, and they became husband and wife.
As a hunter’s wife, the woman had to clean and prepare his arrows and the nets and traps that he used for hunting.
She performed these duties obediently.
The couple had seven children, and in time they all were married.
One day as the Buddha surveyed the world with his psychic vision, he saw that this entire family could become enlightened, so he paid them a visit.
The Buddha went first to an empty trap set by the hunter.
He placed his footprint beside the trap, then waited in the bushes.
When the hunter came and saw the trap empty, with the footprint beside it, he thought that someone had stolen from his trap.
On spying the Buddha in the bushes, he aimed his bow and arrow at him and then became immobilized in that position.
Finally, the wife went looking for her family.
She found them pointing arrows at the Buddha.
Throwing up her hands, she shouted, “Don’t kill my father!” When her family heard these words, they thought that the man must be her father, whom they had never met.
The husband thought, “This is my father-in-law!” The children thought, “This is our grandfather!” Their hearts filled with love for the man, and so they put down their weapons and bowed.
Then the Buddha gave them a Dhamma talk, and they all reached the first stage of enlightenment.
Moreover, she had no wish for the animals to be hurt.
She was merely doing her duties as the wife of a hunter.
Then the Buddha explained further:
The palm without wounds
Can hold poison safely;
Just as without a wound, poison does not enter,
So evil does not penetrate
The innocent mind.
Although the hunter’s wife prepared instruments for killing animals, she did so only to obey her husband, for in that culture in those times, a wife did not have much choice about such things.
The woman’s lack of intention to harm shielded her mind from the negative consequences of her actions.
Since she did not wish any harm to the animals, her actions were innocent.
If you feel your livelihood is harmful, but you know for certain that nothing else is available that would allow you and your family to survive, you can gradually try to find a better situation.
In the meantime, send loving-friendliness to everyone affected by your work, and calm your mind by remaining focused on your wholesome intentions.
If we adopt Skillful Livelihood as our goal, we can gradually move toward it as our spiritual practice matures.
Ultimately, your job should actively promote the spiritual well-being of everyone involved, because your behavior influences others.
I know of a couple who created a family business making delightful wooden toys designed to be especially safe for children.
Eventually, they expanded their business into a poor community, providing livelihood for many people.
Rather than requiring workers to do their work in the factory, they provided materials and training and allowed workers to build the toys at home, paying by the piece for their finished work.
This approach allowed employees to center their lives around their families, and to work or relax as they felt the need to do.
Sometimes people ask me, “How can I find a skillful form of livelihood?” Since I have had basically the same profession since I was twelve years old, I may not be the best person to tell others how to choose a new career or conduct a job search.
I can tell you this much, however: The way to find your Skillful Livelihood is the same way that you begin any great new undertaking.
Don’t make a big fuss about it.
Just do the next right thing.
Accepting that our job situation is an aspect of our spiritual practice is not easy.
Many people box off their work from their spiritual life.
Lying is still lying, even if we get paid to do it.
We must bear the current and future results of whatever we say and do.
Thus we should hold our job-related activities to the same ethical standards we hold for our other actions.
As with Skillful Speech and Action, Skillful Livelihood requires that we continually purify our behavior, whether at home or on the job.
When we work in a job that fulfills Skillful Livelihood, throughout each workday we should remain sensitive to issues of morality as they arise.
We must be very clear about the five precepts and take care never to violate them.
Moral issues not directly involving the five precepts call for us to reflect upon whether we can live with the consequences of our actions.
As our practice of mindfulness meditation deepens, we may develop so much calm and patience that a previously unacceptable situation becomes no problem, and just about any honest job becomes perfect for us.
The most important consideration is that a job does not interfere with our ability to make spiritual progress.
So long as we are not hurting ourselves by breaking precepts or becoming involved in other worrisome ethical situations, our mind can become calm and peaceful.
With a calm and peaceful mind, we can grow.
Once we clear away the obstacles, the rest takes care of itself.
The situation is comparable to the way we stay alive.
When we are hungry, we eat.
When we are thirsty, we drink.
We put on a sweater when we are cold.
We do things to avoid illness.
We avoid harmful and dangerous activities and situations.
But we do not go around saying, “I must live, I must live!” If we just take care of our basic needs, the body maintains itself in life.
Similarly, in Skillful Livelihood, our only responsibility is to avoid causing harm to ourselves or others, so that we remain calm and peaceful.
So long as our mind is calm and peaceful, we can meditate and progress on the Buddha’s path to happiness.
If we wish to progress more quickly, we can seek employment that nurtures our practice and propels us along more quickly.
Such a job presents situations that challenge our weak areas in a way that strengthens them without being overwhelming, and avoids presenting us with problems we are not currently prepared to deal with.
For example, someone trying to cultivate refined, sublime states of concentration may be best served by a job that provides easy, routine work that does not overly excite the mind.
Someone who is deliberately cultivating patience may flourish in a job that requires working with challenging situations and difficult people.
In your meditation period, take some time to use the three-tiered inquiry to assess to what extent your current job constitutes Skillful Livelihood.
You may decide that your current job has aspects that need improvement.
Ask yourself what you can do today to make your job situation more actively helpful to yourself and to others.
Here are the key points to remember concerning mindfulness of Skillful Livelihood:
Our means of sustenance should not interfere with our spiritual development.
We can assess whether a job qualifies as Skillful Livelihood by means of a three-tiered inquiry.
At the first level of inquiry, we examine whether a job is inherently harmful to others or to oneself.
At the second level, we consider whether a job causes us to break any of the five moral precepts.
Finally, we ask whether other factors related to the job make it difficult for the mind to settle down.
Loving-friendliness may improve a difficult job situation.
If you lack harmful intentions, your mind will not be harmed by a job’s adverse consequences.
Skillful Livelihood is a goal to be sought gradually as our spiritual practice matures.
STEP 6 - Skillful Effort
AT EVERY MOMENT we choose whether to embrace wholesomeness or unwholesomeness.
We are not helpless, passive victims of fate.
We are not pawns moved about by greater forces, nor do our experiences happen due to predetermination.
In this moment we choose, and then in the next moment we experience the results of that choice, along with any continuing effects of past choices.
A wholesome choice in this moment sets up a good mental environment for happiness in the next moment.
If the previous moment was relatively pure and clean, the current one will be, too.
With billions of fairly pure moments, we experience a second of happiness.
With good mental habits developing, second by second, these seconds eventually add up to make longer moments of happiness.
Our lives are created out of these tiny little choices, billions of them happening in just seconds.
But these subtleties of mind are not the place to begin the practice.
You must start where you can see clearly, with your outward behavior.
First, observe the five precepts and stop behavior deadly to spiritual progress.
Once the mind no longer is shaken by the effects of unskillful behavior, it becomes easier to see what is going on inside.
We can then slow down enough to see our train of thought.
Later, as we refine our ability to see how the mind moves, we may see individual mind moments arise, peak, and pass away.
To begin, however, it is enough just to become aware of general trends of thought as they occur.
With that awareness, we can use Skillful Effort to make new choices.
The Buddha urged everyone to choose wholesome mental states over unwholesome ones and to cultivate wholesome mental states moment by moment, until the unwholesome ones stop returning.
We do this, the Buddha said, by continually rousing ourselves, “making effort, stirring up energy, and exerting mind.”
First, with strong determination and energy, we do whatever we can to prevent the arising of painful, unwholesome states of mind, such as resentment, jealousy, or greed.
Since we are not yet enlightened, however, some negative mind states are going to sneak in, despite our best efforts.
We then make the second effort, rousing ourselves to overcome whatever unwholesome states have taken hold.
Third, we replace those states with wholesome ones, such as loving thoughts, ideas of generosity, or feelings of compassion.
Finally, we exert effort to cultivate further these pleasing, wholesome mental states.
The more we make these efforts, the more clear and free of pain our minds become, and the more happiness we experience as the natural result.
Accomplishing anything requires effort.
This is true in everyday activities such as painting a house or making a sales presentation, and even more so in our spiritual endeavors.
Skillful Effort is woven into every step of the path.
When we study the Buddha’s message with the four kinds of effort, making the mind wholesome, clear, and able to comprehend, we can achieve Skillful Understanding of the path.
Then we apply the fourfold effort to our thoughts, words, and deeds, resulting in Skillful Thinking, Skillful Speech, and Skillful Action.
When we make the same fourfold effort to apply moral principles to our work life, we achieve Skillful Livelihood.
Applying this effort to our meditation practice leads to Skillful Mindfulness and Skillful Concentration.
We might rightly conclude that Skillful Effort is the fuel needed to power our accomplishment of each of the steps on the Buddha’s path.
In fact, making a strong effort to discipline ourselves is about half the battle.
Without a powerful effort to achieve wholesome states of mind, we won’t get far toward reaching the happiness we seek.
We may like to believe that all we have to do to progress on the Buddha’s path is pay attention.
Paying attention certainly sounds easier than making strong effort.
But the hard truth is that simple, ordinary attention is not enough.
We must learn to pay mindful attention—both when we are engaging in meditation or other spiritual practice and when we are going about the activities of our everyday lives.
The Buddha knew that unless we make the mindful effort to eliminate negative states of mind and cultivate positive ones in every aspect of our lives, our minds will never settle down enough to allow us to progress.
” Of course, you’d be right.
It’s certainly easier to bury our negative qualities deep in the unconscious mind than to let them go.
Greed, anger, hatred, sloppiness, arrogance, snobbishness, spitefulness, vindictiveness, and fear may have become our familiar, everyday habits.
We’d rather not make the effort to give them up.
Yet, at the same time, we want to be happy and to move toward our spiritual goals.
Skillful Effort is the stick-to-it quality that makes the whole path possible.
In order to let go of our unwholesome mind habits, we need to recognize them.
In general terms, what we want to eliminate are any states of mind that block us from experiencing happiness.
If you want to weed a garden, you have to be able to distinguish the weeds from the flowers.
The same is true here.
At the beginning, we find our mental gardens choked with weeds.
We identify and remove unwholesome qualities, such as anger, and replace them with useful, skillful qualities such as loving-friendliness.
If you think about it for a moment, you’ll be able to come up with your own list of mental weeds.
You’ll know that when you’re experiencing rage, jealousy, lust, or vengefulness, you can’t simultaneously be happy.
Underneath these negative states, no matter how they manifest, are the same basic roots: greed , hatred , and delusion .
You can think of greed, in combination with ignorance, as the root of all mental weeds.
Fetters cause your thoughts to flow directly into suffering.
They are the cause of each lifetime and its suffering.
The presence of fetters prevents enlightenment and guarantees future lives.
The fetters caused this life, too.
We usually group these ten fetters to reflect the stages by which they must be overcome on the way to enlightenment.
Fetters overcome to reach the first stage of enlightenment:
belief in the existence of a permanent self or soul
doubt in the message of the Buddha
belief that one can end suffering merely by following rules and rituals
Fetters overcome to reach the second and third stages:
greed for sensual pleasures
Fetters overcome to reach the fourth stage:
subtle desire to exist in fine material form
subtle desire to exist in immaterial form
conceit, or the underlying perception of self-identity
All ten fetters remain in the mind of an unenlightened person, at least in a dormant way, all the time.
Sometimes one of these fetters will come to the forefront of the mind, causing the person to profoundly misunderstand reality and to suffer.
Every mind moment contains at least the fetters of subtle desire and ignorance, but other fetters sometimes join with them.
As we gain wisdom bit by bit, we weaken these fetters, finally breaking through and destroying them in stages.
After each breakthrough we reach a higher level of enlightenment.
When we break the first three fetters, we attain the first stage of enlightenment.
When we weaken the next two, we achieve the second stage.
The small amount of greed and hatred that remains is far more subtle than what has been removed.
When we break through the remaining greed and hatred, we reach the third stage.
The five last fetters are very subtle.
With their destruction comes the fourth and final stage of enlightenment.
The first fetter, belief in a permanent self or soul, causes a conviction that the aggregates of existence have some sort of relationship with a self or soul.
This fetter may manifest as a belief that physical form, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and consciousness are one and the same thing as the soul, that they are identical.
At other times this fetter may cause a conviction that these aggregates possess a soul .
We may have the belief that the soul caused the combination of aggregates .
Finally, it may manifest as a belief that our soul or self is one thing, and the body, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and consciousness are a totally separatething, unrelated to the soul.
The most common way that this fetter manifests is in the idea that we possessed a soul in a previous life, that this soul came into this life and currently possesses our aggregates, and that it will leave our body and go to another existence after our death.
In essence, this belief rests on the idea that the soul is permanent, eternal, and never changing.
The second fetter, doubt, refers specifically to doubt that the Buddha’s practice of cultivating morality, concentration, and wisdom will bring lasting happiness.
Doubt may become active when you stray from what you truly know in the present moment and reflect unwisely upon matters that tend to stimulate uncertainty.
Certain “imponderables” are well known for their power to stimulate and strengthen the fetter of doubt.
These are speculative questions such as how and when the universe came into existence, and other such things.
All these questions and considerations lead us down blind alleys and into the thickets of doubt and confusion.
Engaging in them keeps us from paying mindful attention to what is really important.
These kinds of questions can never be answered satisfactorily and just distract us.
But until we attain the first stage of enlightenment, they will linger in the mind.
The Buddha advised people simply to watch such questions arise and pass away.
Do not follow them or worry about them.
Proceed with your attempts to understand and reflect upon what you can know by personal experience, not merely by reasoning, in this moment.
Have faith in the Buddha’s path to happiness that so many people have followed to enlightenment.
Faith, in Buddhist terms, means confidence—confidence based on what you have seen so far, and confidence in what you can project to be true based on what you have seen.
For example, you have personally observed that whenever you were full of negative mental states, you suffered.
You recall that whenever you were full of positive states of mind, you felt happy.
When all these states changed you saw their impermanence.
These are facts.
You can have confidence in this.
This kind of confidence keeps you on course until a deep realization of truth leaves no more room for doubt.
Belief in Rites and Rituals
The third fetter is an instinctive movement of the mind to find some source of assistance from outside, rather than from internal purification.
It manifests as clinging to belief in the efficacy of rules and rituals to bring enlightenment.
You may think that the highest happiness can be attained by performing ceremonies, engaging in celebrations, organizing processions, making offerings to the Buddha or to deities, chanting, praying, and saying mantras rather than meditating and applying the Buddha’s message to your daily life.
This clinging wastes your time and blocks your ability to see the truth.
Thus you impede your progress along the path.
The fetter of greed is the desire for any sensual pleasure.
It includes desire for any pleasant sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles, even the physical material body itself.
It also includes all thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and opinions.
The fetter of hatred is aversion to anything unpleasant, anything you don’t like.
Subtle Desire for Existence
The subtle desire to exist in material or immaterial form, conceit, and the fetters of restlessness and ignorance are the most refined forms of greed.
These five fetters form the last obstacles to full enlightenment.
The subtle desire for existence in fine material or immaterial forms refers to the general will to live, to exist in some form, any form.
The desire to exist “in” this physical body disappears with the removal of the grosser level of greed.
However, the desire to exist in a more refined, “fine material” form still remains, such as the desire for existence in some kind of ethereal body.
This is said to be the form of some of the higher gods.
Or if not in an ethereal body, one desires to exist even with no body at all.
This is said to be the future existence of those who have accomplished the highest level of concentration; they become the highest gods.
Conceit refers to the experiential quality of seeming to exist as someone.
This fetter is the moment-to-moment sense of “I” from which so much misunderstanding and confusion flows.
The mind thinks “I…, I…, I…,” most of the time, never understanding that the sense of “I” is yet another impermanent and impersonal experience of the mental processes.
For example, the mind may say, “I heard a sound,” but with wisdom comes the truth, the knowing that there was only a sound.
The fetter of restlessness and worry is very subtle, unlike the hindrance of the same name.
Worry is a kind of fretting due to the expected future impact of having even the most subtle unwholesomeness remaining in the mind.
Worry causes restlessness, in which the mind cannot settle on anything.
The fetter of restlessness and worry keeps the mind fluttering like a banner in the wind, so that it cannot stop and understand the truth of its own impermanence.
It is as if the mind were startled again and again by fear of its nonexistence.
This fetter never goes away completely until full enlightenment.
Ignorance as a fetter refers to a persistent blindness to the nature of suffering, its source, its possible extinction, and the way to end suffering.
In other words, ignorance of the Four Noble Truths.
The ten fetters are incredibly powerful.
When they arise in our awareness, hot as a boiling pot of water, it takes great effort to cool them down.
The functioning of these chains is subtle and insidious, but with mindfulness, we can discern how it happens.
Let’s examine gross greed, the fourth fetter.
We know that we have senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
We can notice that these senses are in touch with the external world.
Because of the constant interaction between the senses and the objects of this world, pleasant feelings may arise, and then the desire for enjoying sensual pleasure arises in us.
With mindfulness, we can notice the arising of desire.
If, for some reason, desire does not arise, we can notice this lack of desire as well.
Desire makes us want this thing or that thing, prefer this time or that time, like this person or that person—or situation, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought.
Because of all this liking or disliking, our mind is always either clinging or rejecting.
Most significantly, we like life and cling to it, or we reject it.
Thus gross greed for sensual pleasures strengthens the chain that binds us to repeated existence in this world.
Any fetter may arise at the instant of contact.
Let us look at the belief in a permanent self.
With contact, a feeling arises that may be pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
At that instant the notion of permanent selfhood arises: “This is ‘I’ that is making ‘me’ feel.
And this ‘I’ is in ‘me’ in a solid, unchanging, permanent way.
” This fetter of belief in a permanent, eternal “I” binds us to seeking pleasant objects and rejecting unpleasant objects.
This “I” isn’t happy.
It does not get exposed only to pleasant objects all the time, the way it wants to.
Objects surround us, and not all of them are pleasant.
If, however, we could really see that a feeling that arises is impermanent—if we could be aware of its appearance and disappearance—we wouldn’t hang onto it.
We would move on.
If we could recognize that the nature of anything is to pass away, and let it go when it has passed, the mind would be relieved of the tension of seeking pleasant objects all the time.
If we could remain mindful of whatever comes up, knowing that it must pass away, the fetter of belief in a permanent self would not appear.
Let’s look at another fetter, the belief in rites and rituals.
Perhaps you have a ritual of lighting a candle every morning and praying for relief from suffering.
As you get up in the morning, you think, “Ah, I must do my ritual.
” You do not try to reduce your psychic irritants by cultivating wisdom, concentration, or wholesome states such as loving-friendliness.
Instead, you cling to the belief that performing this ritual in the morning will bring happiness.
Years later, even if you never miss a day, you will not have moved an inch toward enlightenment.
When you watch your mind with attention, you can see the fetters arising when the senses make contact with the world.
Until you reach enlightenment, each time any of the six senses contact their objects, fetters will arise.
Mindfulness can help you discriminate between the senses, sensory objects, and the fetters as they arise.
When the fetters come up, you should use mindful effort to overcome them.
When they disappear, you should be mindful of that state, and when they do not appear, you should be aware of that state as well.
Out of the ten fetters come certain crude, extremely unwholesome mind states that prevent you from making any progress in your meditation or from doing things skillfully in your life.
We call these mind states hindrances.
If a fetter is like wind, a hindrance would be like a tornado.
The hindrances create havoc for new meditators.
The five hindrances are greed, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt.
They arise out of the fetters according to circumstances, flaring up like flames from searing-hot coals.
But, like flames, hindrances can be doused with Skillful Effort, rightly applied.
The hindrances can be prevented by concentration or by steady mindfulness.
Mindfulness or concentration cool the hindrances down and overcome them when they have arisen.
When the mind lacks any hindrances, it automatically becomes bright, luminous, and clear.
Such a mind is receptive to the development of wholesome states, to concentration, and to the ability to see clearly into the impermanent nature of things.
Any of us can be rid of all these hindrances, at least temporarily.
So long as the underlying ten fetters continue to exist, the hindrances may return to visit the mind, again and again.
But with application of the four kinds of Skillful Effort, you can reduce and shorten their visits.
When you become skillful in applying effort, the hindrances cause little or no problem to your meditation or to your daily life.
The hindrance of greed or covetousness is the desire to obtain things.
In meditation, this hindrance comes as greedy thoughts about food or things you want to possess, or as lust.
Such thoughts can waste much of the meditation session, and indulging in them can become a difficult habit to break.
This trap of greed is not unlike the way monkeys are trapped in some cultures.
A trapper slices a small hole across the top of a coconut and empties out the liquid.
He cuts some chunks of coconut flesh and leaves them in the bottom of the shell, then ties the shell tightly to a tree.
The monkey slips his hand into the hole and grabs the loose chunks of coconut.
He tries to pull out the coconut chunks, but his fist cannot come through the small hole.
When the trapper returns, the greedy monkey is so attached to the bits of coconut he holds in his fist that he will not let go and withdraw his hand.
It’s easy to feel sorry for the monkey.
We have all been trapped by greed.
The hindrance of ill will, including hatred, anger, and resentment, springs from the desire to avoid things we do not like.
Ill will is compared to boiling water.
In other words, ill will burns you more than it hurts someone else, and you’ll never find the true cause or “get to the bottom” of your hostile feelings while anger is boiling inside you.
Ill will also distorts our perceptions and sours our joys.
It is like a sickness that makes delicious food so tasteless that we cannot enjoy it.
Similarly, when our mind is filled with hatred, we cannot appreciate the fine qualities of the people around us.
Dullness and Drowsiness
During meditation it often happens that people struggle with greed and then with ill will.
Dullness is sluggishness of mind, while drowsiness is physical languor.
When we are feeling slothful or sleepy, it’s impossible to concentrate or to get any work done.
It’s also impossible to practice mindfulness or to meditate.
The hindrance of dullness and drowsiness is compared to being in prison.
When you are locked up, you do not know what’s happening outside the prison walls.
In the same way, when you allow your mind to sink into dullness or your body into drowsiness, you do not know what is happening around you or within you.
Worrying causes restlessness, so these two mental states go together.
Neither is conducive to clear thinking, clear understanding, or clear knowing.
This hindrance is compared to slavery.
The slave works very hard to please his or her cruel master, always worrying and nervous in fear of punishment.
The more nervous and restless the slave gets, the more he or she will worry.
The slave never enjoys peace of mind.
The hindrance of doubt is perplexity, not knowing the right direction or where to turn.
Doubt is sparked by thinking about things other than what you can observe happening in the present moment.
Doubt is like going into the desert without a map or a set of directions.
When you walk through the desert, it’s easy to get confused because the landscape markings are hard to distinguish.
A given direction could be the right one or the wrong.
Just so, when doubt arises about the truth of the Buddha’s teachings, you become perplexed and have a hard time deciding what to do.
Maybe I should be doing it differently, or trying another teacher, or exploring something altogether different.”
These doubts sap your energy, create confusion, and make it impossible to see anything clearly.
Now we can discuss just how we deal with the mental weeds of hindrances and fetters and cultivate better states of mind.
The Buddha taught a four-step approach to working with the mind.
You should apply Skillful Effort to:
prevent negative states of mind
overcome negative states of mind
cultivate positive states of mind
maintain positive states of mind
Your first line of defense is to prevent negative or unwholesome states of mind from arising in the first place.
Just that.
Mindfulness requires training, and training requires effort.
There are five points to mindfulness training: morality, mindfulness, wisdom, patience, and effort.
Effort is used with each of the other points.
You start with good morality, which takes effort, as we saw in discussions of previous steps of the path.
With morality as a stable base, you make the effort to exercise whatever mindfulness you can already remember to practice.
One aspect of mindfulness is “remembering,” and this should be kept alive all the time.
Again and again, you remember to reapply the mind to the present moment.
You bring together more and more moments in which you are successfully mindful.
I’ve heard it said, “A moment of mindfulness is never wasted.”
You then apply your insights, bringing increasing wisdom to your efforts.
You stop and think, “How did this go last time?” Feeling the impact of your mistakes gives you great incentive to avoid them in the future.
You recall what you have learned and stop repeating mistakes.
This way, you mold your behavior very quickly.
As your wisdom about reality deepens, you remind yourself repeatedly about your new priorities and become unwilling to let a moment go by without bringing up mindfulness and wisdom.
If you fail, you apply patience: you suffer the consequences and then patiently make the effort to be mindful again.
Developing steady mindfulness can be a lengthy process, so the Buddha gave his disciples some tips on how to protect their minds.
He advised them to exercise “wise attention” and to avoid “unwise attention.”
He explained that you should stick to what you know to be true right now through the five senses.
That is your own domain, your true home.
Thinking carries you away from that safe place.
For instance, on hearing a sound during meditation, just know “sound,” instead of speculating about who made that sound and what it might mean.
On noticing unpleasant sensations of coolness while at work, just observe this sensation without forming an opinion about the air-conditioning system of the building.
As you wait at a bus stop, observe your thoughts as just passing phenomena, like the passing cars, without hitching a ride with them.
The Buddha urged his monks to put up with the small uncomfortable realities of life without automatically trying to fix things.
If you keep choosing to change things to get comfortable all the time, the mind gets fussy, and unwholesome states arise more quickly.
Notice the changes in your physical discomfort and your mind’s changing reactions to it.
Learn to endure the small things.
Of course, some people may carry this kind of advice too far.
If urgent things arise, you should mindfully take care of them!
The Buddha also encouraged avoidance of foolish, unmindful people, since we all tend to pick up each other’s behaviors.
Associate with people who have qualities you want to emulate.
Find a good spiritual friend who is upright, mindful, well restrained, and moderate in behavior.
Stick close and seek the advice of this person when needed.
The Buddha further advised his disciples not to notice the “signs and features” of any external stimulus that might give rise to unwholesome mind states.
“Sign” refers to the hook, the thing that catches your eye and makes you want to observe something more closely in order to rouse up some unwholesome state.
“Feature” refers to specific qualities of the object of your attention that may further stir up the unwholesome state.
For instance, a married man might be advised not to note or linger upon the coy behavior or the specific attractive features of a woman to whom he might become attracted.
Similarly, a married woman might be well advised not to note whether a nice-looking man wears a wedding ring or allow herself to pause to admire his smile.
There was a monk whose vow of celibacy was threatened by recurring sexual fantasies.
He practiced meditating on the body as a skeleton to rid himself of these troubling thoughts.
One day he was walking on a forest path.
A beautiful woman came along this same path, headed alone toward her parents’ house after a fight with her husband.
When she saw the monk, she smiled at him as she passed.
A little while later, the woman’s husband came walking along the same path looking for his wife.
When he saw the monk, he asked him, “Sir, did you see a beautiful young woman passing this way?”
“I don’t know whether it was a man or a woman,” the monk replied, “but I saw a skeleton passing this way.”
The monk had prevented lustful thoughts from arising by applying Skillful Effort to his meditation practice.
He had thus protected his mind from unwholesome states.
If you are able to maintain continuous mindfulness, nothing will upset you.
You will not become angry or agitated.
You can be patient no matter what anyone says or does.
You can stay peaceful and happy.
An unwholesome or negative state of mind cannot arise at the same moment as a moment of mindfulness.
Perhaps you find that preventing negative mind states is easy so long as you do not encounter unpleasant people or situations.
When everything is going smoothly, it’s easy to keep your mindfulness intact.
You might even congratulate yourself for being able to remain patient and accept praise for your self-control and forbearance from your family, friends, and colleagues.
But when things start to go wrong, your patience and mindfulness may start to break down.
A story told by the Buddha describes how easily this can happen.
Once there was a rich lady who had a dutiful and skillful servant woman.
The servant got up very early and started her work before anybody in the house woke up.
She worked all day until very late in the evening.
Her only rest was a few hours of sleep each night.
Often, she heard the neighbors speaking very highly of her mistress.
They said, “This rich lady is very kind to her servant woman.
She is very patient.
We never see her lose her temper.
We wonder how she became such a wonderful person.”
The servant woman thought, “These people speak very highly of my mistress.
They do not know how hard I work to keep this house neat.
I must test for myself how kind and patient this lady is.”
The next day, the servant woke up a little late.
When the rich lady woke up, she noticed that the servant woman was still sleeping.
She had not been asleep.
She was simply pretending to sleep.
When she got up, she apologized to her mistress and started her work.
The next day, the servant woke up later than the previous day.
The rich lady was furious.
She scolded the servant woman, using harsh words, and threatened that if the servant woman woke up late again, she would beat her.
On the third day, the servant woman woke up later still.
The rich lady was so enraged that she took a broom and struck the servant woman until her head was bleeding.
Last night I worked until midnight, and I had a headache.
Therefore, I slept a little later today.”
The neighbors who had praised the rich lady for her patience and compassion quickly changed their views.
You may have experienced this same kind of breakdown after a long and relaxing vacation or when you return from a spiritual retreat.
While you were away, your anger, impatience, jealousy, and fear were inactive, and you felt peaceful and happy.
Then you wondered, “How can I maintain this happy vacation feeling or retreat feeling in everyday life?”
The everyday answer is mindfulness.
For example, suppose you go to buy a pair of gloves in an expensive store, and the salesperson is very rude.
From past experience, you know that rude salespeople make you angry.
So, you take care to be especially mindful and head off any angry thoughts.
You reason with yourself by thinking: “Well, this salesperson is also a human being.
Perhaps he did not get a good night’s sleep.
Or he may have financial worries or family problems.
Maybe he suffers from insecurities about people of my race or nationality.
Or maybe he’s not feeling very well today.
That may be why he is unable to speak politely to his customers.”
This technique may sound easy, but it’s not.
Our minds have not been trained to prevent negative patterns of thinking.
Getting angry is very easy, criticizing others is very easy, worrying about tomorrow is very easy, desiring things is very easy.
These habits of mind are like junk food.
Once you start eating a bag of potato chips, it’s hard to stop.
Preventing negative thoughts from arising is hard, too.
Once you are hooked, it is difficult to let go.
Easy it is for the good to do good.
Difficult it is for the evil to do good.
Easy it is for the evil to do evil.
Difficult it is for the good to do evil.
It is very easy to do things that are harmful to oneself.
It is very difficult to do things that are beneficial to oneself.
Nevertheless, you should hold firmly to the knowledge that prevention is always easier than cure.
Mindfulness practiced with Skillful Effort can prevent negative thoughts and actions from arising in the future.
Preventing harmful habits of body, speech, and mind is not impossible, if you train yourself in mindfulness.
When negative thoughts and actions do arise in spite of your sincere effort to prevent them, you should not be depressed or disappointed.
It doesn’t mean that you are a bad person, it just means you have more work to do.
Be happy in realizing that you have a helper to assist you: the effort to overcome negative states of mind.
Overcoming Negative States of Mind
Prior to full enlightenment, we cannot choose what thoughts will arise, so there’s no need to be ashamed or to react with aversion to whatever comes up.
We do choose, however, what thoughts we allow to proliferate.
Positive and wholesome thoughts help the mind.
They should be cultivated.
Negative and unwholesome thoughts, such as the five hindrances and the ten fetters, harm the mind.
They should be opposed immediately with Skillful Effort and overcome.
This is the Buddha’s own advice.
Overcoming the Hindrances
How you respond to a hindrance depends upon how entrenched it is.
Hindrances do not arrive full-blown.
They start as a single negative mind moment and then proliferate.
The sooner you catch this train of thought, the easier it is to stop it.
Any time hindrances are present, you cannot make progress with mindfulness or concentration.
At first it is very simple.
A hindrance arises, and you simply notice it.
You notice, for instance, that you are having greedy, angry, confused, or worried thoughts or that your mind has become trapped in a restless, dull, or depressed state.
At this first level, the hindrances are very weak, so the method of overcoming them is mild as well.
You simply notice the presence of the negative mind state.
By mere attention, the negative thought fades away, and you notice its absence and how this absence gives rise to thoughts of generosity, loving-friendliness, and wise clarity.
If a hindrance has developed beyond that initial stage, you have to take stronger measures.
First, look at the negative thought with complete mindfulness.
Pay it total attention.
Look at its impermanent nature.
Look at the impermanent nature of the circumstances, appearances, moods, tastes, interests, and numerous other conditions that caused the thought to arise.
Reflect on the harm you might cause yourself by entertaining this negative thought and the worse harm that might come from acting upon it.
Now, reason with yourself.
Remind yourself that everything is impermanent and that the situation that caused this thought or mind state to arise will certainly change.
For example, if someone has said something that angers you, remind yourself of the problems you face in your life—concerns about money or health, worries about your job or family.
Tell yourself that this person may be experiencing similar problems.
You do not really know what is going on in someone’s mind at any given moment.
Frankly speaking, you do not know even what is happening in your mind at any given moment.
Your state of mind depends on numerous conditions.
In fact, everything that happens depends on many different causes and conditions.
Reflecting in this way may cause your negative mind state to fade.
Say you wake up in the morning in a bad mood.
You do not know any specific reason why you feel upset, angry, depressed, edgy, or grouchy.
But if you think very carefully, you may remember that you ate some spicy food for dinner or watched TV for several hours before going to bed.
Yet eating spicy food or watching TV are not themselves the causes for your bad mood this morning.
These actions are themselves the results of other causes.
Maybe you had an argument earlier in the day with your son or your husband and watched TV longer than usual because you were upset or anxious.
Then you might remember that your argument was triggered by a bad situation at the office, which was itself the result of other causes and conditions.
Thus everything we experience has causes and circumstances behind it—many more than we can analyze or even know.
All of these causes are related to each other.
No single event can cause anything else.
Therefore there is no need to make your negative mind state worse by blaming yourself for it—or by blaming anyone else!
Moreover, you can remind yourself that, fortunately, all events and situations change.
Nothing ever remains the same.
When you feel utterly desperate, you may believe that nothing will ever change.
However, when you look more closely, you can see that this belief is mistaken.
People do change.
Situations change.
You change.
There is nothing that does not change.
Therefore, as time passes, that depressing mood or angry state of mind also changes.
Your feeling about an unpleasant person or situation changes.
When you come to this realization, you relax a little, and your negative thoughts start to fade.
You may notice the existence of such thoughts when you sit down to meditate and work with your practice of mindfulness or concentration.
You cannot focus your mind on the breath because some negative thought whirls round and round in your head.
If so, you temporarily put aside your plan to work on concentration or to observe the rising, peaking, and falling away of sensations and mental states, and set your mind to examining thoroughly what is going on.
If you would prefer to get on with your intended practice, however, there are several remedies you can use.
They are listed in order of increasing forcefulness.
If one fails, try the next.
Ignore it.
Divert the mind to something else.
Replace the hindrance by its opposite.
Reflect on fact that every hindrance arises from a great number of causes and conditions and is in flux.
With clenched teeth, pressing the tongue against the upper palate, apply all your energy to overcome it.
Let’s say, for example, that you keep thinking angrily about a dispute with your friend.
Simply paying attention to the thoughts has not brought you relief.
Reasoning with yourself has also failed.
You have also tried ignoring the thoughts.
When you do not pay attention to any kind of thought, it wastes away.
Yet this method, too, has failed to overcome your angry state of mind.
Switch your attention to something completely different, such as the pleasant activities you have planned for tomorrow.
If that fails, divert your mind to the opposite of anger, loving-friendliness.
Recall times of peace and harmony you have had with your friend.
Allow these good memories to fill your mind.
Then try to send loving thoughts to your friend.
If this seems too difficult, send loving thoughts to your child or stir up loving feelings by reflecting on the qualities of your teacher or someone else whom you love.
When you are radiating loving thoughts, there is no room in your mind for anger.
If the angry thoughts still persist, take a hard look at them.
Notice how they change, arising and passing, appearing and disappearing.
Consider the loss you suffer to your own peace of mind and to your spiritual development from entertaining unwholesome mind states.
If all else fails, you must crush the negative thought with all your might—according to the Buddha’s own words, “like a strong man might crush a weaker man.”
In other words, you must never let the unwholesome thought win.
You may be thinking that this method of gritting your teeth and crushing a negative thought seems so harsh, so unlike any other instructions you may have heard for dealing with the mind.
You might even think that it seems out of character with the gentle nature of Buddhism.
But forceful effort is quite consistent with the Buddha’s life and teaching.
He taught us to strive with diligence.
As we have noted, Skillful Effort is the fuel that powers our accomplishment of every step on the path to happiness.
With Skillful Effort we take precautions to prevent harmful thoughts, words, and deeds.
With Skillful Effort we overcome tension, anxiety, worry, fear, and resentment.
With Skillful Effort we practice mindfulness to cultivate those wonderful qualities within us that we are not yet aware we have.
Arouse your wonderful qualities and bring them to the surface of your mind.
From the day he attained enlightenment until he passed away, the Buddha reminded people to be similarly diligent in their spiritual efforts.
In spite of this teaching, sometimes people say that spiritual growth takes “effortless effort.”
I’m sorry to disillusion you, friends, but there is no effortless effort.
Effort must be balanced.
Too much effort or unskillful effort can cause more stress for the mind and lead to a downward spiral into unwholesome states.
Yet if effort is too slack, you will become bored or tired or lose interest.
Then you must make unrelenting effort to bring effort back into balance with other wholesome mental factors.
The truth is that you can never achieve anything great without effort.
Every great invention took effort.
The electric light, the automobile, and the computer did not happen because someone just sat back and relaxed.
The inventors worked very hard on their projects.
A story about the Buddha makes this point clear:
A horse trainer asked the Buddha, “How do you train disciples?”
Buddha asked him, “How do you train horses?”
The trainer answered, “I apply gentle ways.
If that does not work, I apply harsh methods.
If I cannot train them by harsh methods, I kill the horses.”
Buddha said, “I do the same thing.
I use a gentle method.
If by using that method, I cannot train my disciples, I use harsh methods.
If I cannot train them by using harsh methods, I kill them.”
Then the Buddha explained his killing method.
The suttas tell of a famous incident in which the Buddha used this method:
The Buddha had an old friend named Channa.
Channa went forth as a monk when he was advanced in age.
Because of the role he had played in the Buddha’s life, Channa took all the credit for the accomplishments of the Buddha and became very proud.
From the time of his ordination he showed disrespect for the Sangha.
For example, when senior monks visited him, he did not perform the customary duties such as getting up and offering them a seat or bringing them water to wash their feet and faces.
The Buddha told Channa that his behavior was very arrogant.
He said to him, “You must respect these monks.”
But Channa never obeyed the Buddha.
Finally, when Buddha was going to pass away, Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha what to do with Channa.
When the Buddha passed away, Channa was so shocked and grief-stricken that he began to think, “All my reputation, power, and courage came from the Buddha.
Now that he is gone, I have no support from anybody.
Now the whole world is empty.
I have offended many monks, and they are no longer my friends.”
When Ananda pronounced the boycott on Channa, Channa was shocked a second time, and he passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he became very humble.
The Buddha knew that Channa would respond this way.
Channa practiced meditation obediently and diligently.
Eventually, he became enlightened.
Harsh methods are sometimes necessary.
Harshness sometimes works.
You can use the same technique on your own hindrances.
Begin with a gentle method, but be willing to use a harsh method if you have to.
When you are tempted to buy another pretty sweater although your closet is full of them, discipline the mind as we have described.
Ignore the thought; divert the mind to something else; replace the greedy thought with a generous one; reflect mindfully on the impermanent nature of sweaters and all material things.
If the mind is still whining and crying for that sweater, you may need to get harsh with yourself.
Tell yourself to stop, or there will be no new sweaters this season.
If that doesn’t work, decide there will be no new sweaters this year.
The mind learns to let go.
There is a special situation that calls for a very strict method.
Occasionally when you sit in meditation, the mind is completely chaotic.
This may be due to something that happened prior to the meditation session, such as excessive stimulation during the day or something that caused overwhelming anxiety.
The mind is so agitated, with images and emotions coming so quickly, that you have hardly dealt with one negative thought before you face the next.
You may experience what I have heard students call a “multiple hindrance attack.
” That is when several hindrances arise and take over the mind, one after another.
If you accept the mind running around in this way, it can become a difficult habit to overcome.
It is better to use everything you’ve got to calm the mind.
If all of the usual methods fail in such a case, there is another method: try counting your breaths.
This is a trick to get the mind focused on one thing.
First count the breaths from 1 to 10; then from 10 to 1.
Next, count from 1 to 9 and from 9 to 1.
Continue counting to 8, to 7, and so forth, until you reach 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1.
You continue this counting until you can complete the entire cycle of counting without distraction; then you can return to your usual method of meditation.
This is a challenge.
Starting over again with each distraction causes the mind to get tired of running around.
Even though this method is strong, some people may suffer too much chaos even to do the counting.
In that case, make the chaos itself the object of meditation.
Watch as the chaos changes.
Using the techniques we just discussed, you can train yourself to recognize the fetters when they arise and take steps to overcome them.
With mindful attention and active opposition, the fetter that is troubling you—doubt, greed, hatred, restlessness—slowly weakens and fades from the mind.
The mind knows it is gone and becomes clear.
But then, depending on your temperament and life circumstances, another fetter will surface.
As you pay mindful attention to this cycle of the fetters arising, fading away, and then reappearing in some other form, you start to realize just how powerful these fetters are, just how strongly they bind you to suffering and unhappiness.
No matter how often you temporarily overcome the fetters, the tendencies of mind that appeared as fetters continue to exist within you, binding or trapping you again and again.
You see that you carry a prison within yourself.
As your mindfulness develops, you realize that these negative states of mind—greed, hatred, and delusion—not only distort your thoughts but make every aspect of your life more miserable, more painful.
The mind keeps returning to the same negative patterns.
You feel that you are trapped—fettered—to a never-ending cycle of birth and death.
The truth is that mindfulness can help you suppress the fetters only temporarily.
“Suppressing” refers to pushing all unwholesome states back, holding them at bay through mindfulness or concentration.
Whenever you remain mindful or whenever you go into deep concentration, the fetters remain dormant.
When you make a habit of pushing the fetters down, the suppressed fetters are weakened.
Weakened fetters cause less trouble, moment to moment, and have less impact on your thinking processes.
“Substituting” is the effort to oppose an individual unwholesome state by cultivating its opposite.
You substitute for anger by cultivating loving-friendliness.
The belief in things being eternal is opposed by examining impermanence.
You counter the instinctive belief in a self by analyzing the fluctuating elements that make up your body and mind.
When suppression and substitution are well developed, it becomes possible to break through some weakened fetters.
“Subsiding” refers to the disappearance of those fetters immediately after they are destroyed.
“Escaping” refers to the release of mind that follows the destruction of any group of fetters.
Let’s assume that you have targeted the first three fetters—belief in permanent self, doubt, and belief in the power of rites and rituals—and have deeply studied their opposites.
As you sit in meditation, observing with strong concentration the characteristics of the breath, insight may arise.
Your examination of the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of the breath allows you, in one great insight, to penetrate the fact that all reality shares these three characteristics.
Seeing the impermanence of all things so clearly, you get it on the intuitive level that there cannot be anything permanent called “self” or “soul.
” Thus you break through the first fetter.
You also realize that there must have been a great person who figured all this out while practicing this path, which thus must truly work to uproot all negative states of mind.
Thus you lose the second fetter, doubt.
You now know that nothing can free your mind except the cultivation of wisdom through a path that emphasizes morality, concentration, and insight.
Knowing this, you cease to believe that mere rituals have the power to save you, and so, you shake off the third fetter.
Once you break away from these three fetters, you attain the first stage of enlightenment.
Now, there is no falling back.
You will never again doubt your potential for full enlightenment or wonder how you can achieve it.
You are guaranteed to reach your goal.
You become a “stream-enterer,” because the pull of the spiritual current will carry you to enlightenment, just as a twig is carried along by the current of a stream.
From this point on, there is a new buoyancy to the mind, a sense that, no matter how difficult life’s circumstances may seem, underneath it all everything is okay.
You know, for certain, that everything is impermanent, and this brings comfort to your heart.
You are no longer able to commit any seriously unwholesome acts, because you know too well the law of cause and effect.
With such good behavior, there is no reason for heavy remorse to arise; thus you are freed from that burden.
If you do slip up and, say, tell a small lie, you cannot rest until you have set things right.
You may still fall into explosions of anger, grief, or greed, but these episodes do not take you down so far as before, and they pass quickly.
The whole path makes perfect sense to you, and you have keen, vigorous interest in continuing your training.
You become generally more confident, less self-centered, more generous and kind, better able to concentrate, and more competent at anything you undertake.
Your co-workers and friends notice a change in you, how much sweeter, more lighthearted, and relaxed you have become.
The sparkle in your eyes opens other people’s hearts, and they begin to ask you about the source of your well-being.
To show the significance of attaining stream-entry the Buddha took a little bit of dirt onto his fingernail and said, “Which is more, monks, this little bit of dirt, or all the dirt in the entire world?” Of course the monks answered that the dirt in the rest of the world was much, much more than the little bit upon his fingernail.
Then the Buddha said, “Similarly, monks, the amount of defilement that one destroys by the attainment of stream-entry is as much as the dirt in the rest of the world.
And what the stream-enterer has left to destroy is like the dirt on my fingernail.”
For this reason, he said, attaining stream-entry is greater than becoming a “universal monarch” ruling all other kingdoms.
It is greater than going to heaven to be like an angel; it is even greater than becoming a god.
Having accomplished this breakthrough, you begin to tackle the next hurdle: the fetters of gross greed and hatred.
When you broke through the first three fetters, you also lightened the weight of the remaining fetters.
Thus the greed and hatred you now face are much less than what you experienced as an ordinary person.
You watch for greed and hatred and use Skillful Effort to beat back these enemies again and again.
You develop generosity and loving-friendliness.
You become thoroughly fed up with your mind’s clinging, whining, and grouching.
As you cultivate deeper awareness of impermanence, seeing more clearly the changing nature of all pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings, you see the futility of trying to have things your own way.
You let go more and more.
Finally the day comes when gross greed and hatred are greatly reduced.
Some less obvious greed and hatred remain, holding your personality in place, but much of the job is done.
You become a “once-returner,” meaning that you can be reborn in the physical world only one more time before becoming fully enlightened.
The peace that comes over the mind is indescribable.
All your cares, duties, and burdens fall away, forever.
No harsh words or personal misfortune rattles you.
You are done with being rattled.
People may notice your purity and your unending kindness and begin to think of you as a saint.
Yet, to start out with, you were no better than anyone else.
It is an impersonal process, a natural shift in the mind, that you have achieved thus far by following the Buddha’s directions.
Although you no longer have any clinging or grief for your own losses, your heart is so great, and enough clinging remains, that you can still become overly involved in and saddened by the losses of others.
There is more work to be done.
The remains of greed and hatred have yet to be mopped up.
When the fetters of gross greed and hatred are finally broken, you achieve the third stage of enlightenment.
A person at this stage is known as a “nonreturner,” someone who will never be born again into this world, though one rebirth in a nonmaterial plane of existence is possible.
Once the work of removing gross greed and hatred is done, then the final group, the most subtle of psychic irritants—the last five fetters—must be tackled.
These problems in the mind are so subtle that no ordinary person can notice them, much less feel inspired to try to remove them.
The nonreturner continues to experience, for example, restlessness caused by the worry of anticipating one more future rebirth.
Yet for someone at this level of refinement, these remaining fetters are like a little spot of food staining a perfectly pure, white shirt.
Continuing the training, the nonreturner removes the remaining, subtle desires for any kind of existence.
He or she gets rid of “conceit,” the experiential quality of seeming to have a self.
Restlessness is removed, as is the last remaining bit of ignorance.
In one great moment, all these last fetters are ripped away, and there stands the perfected enlightened one, the arahant.
This one can never again do any acts based upon greed, hatred, or delusion, because these things are forever banished from the mind.
As the Buddha said many times, an arahant is one who has “laid down the burden.”
It may occur to you that perhaps the arahant can fall down to a lower level and be tempted into sexual intercourse, theft, or some other worldly behavior.
If you recall the nature of fetters—how fetters misguide our behaviors and how they are vanquished—you will not entertain such thoughts about the perfectly enlightened ones.
Arahants find even indulgence in sense pleasure unthinkable—much less any immoral actions.
Arahants can never again do wrong.
They continuously taste ultimate happiness, and they remain fully at peace.
At enlightenment, we come to see clearly that everything we need to know is contained within the Four Noble Truths.
We become free from any speculative views or theories about reality, about the past, present, and future, about the existence of the self, and about the universe.
We understand what physical reality is and how it arises and passes away.
We understand what feeling is and how it arises and passes away.
And we understand perception, mental formations, and consciousness in the same way.
We have won complete deliverance from all opinions and conjectures, from all inclinations to claiming or feeling the personal identification of “I” and “mine.
” All of the theories, views, and beliefs that boost the ego have disappeared.
Being totally free from all ten fetters is the stage of full enlightenment.
Cultivating Positive States of Mind
Most people have a tremendous amount of work to do before they can hope to achieve enlightenment.
Overcoming the hindrances and suppressing the fetters is a necessary first step.
But even when your efforts at temporarily overcoming negative states of mind have been successful, the mind remains vulnerable.
It may sink back down into painful, obstructive states, like an airplane descending into clouds.
Once you have temporarily cleared the mind of all unwholesome states, you must use Skillful Effort to gladden, uplift, and energize the mind in order to make progress.
When an unwholesome state has been overcome, the mind goes into a neutral state.
But it does not stay neutral for long.
From the neutral position, the gears can shift in either direction.
Similarly, the mind cannot shift directly from wholesome to unwholesome states or back; it must go through a neutral state in between.
You can use this interval of neutrality to cultivate positive states of mind.
Let’s say you are sitting in meditation, and a negative state of mind arises.
Your mindfulness clicks in, and you recognize the unwholesome state.
You overcome it, perhaps by seeing the danger in it, and return to the breath.
Since the breath is a neutral object, your mind remains neutral as you watch it.
But soon your mindfulness lapses, and another painful state of mind arises.
This sequence happens again and again.
Finally you say to yourself, “This is ridiculous!” Mindfulness makes you aware that you need to stop this pattern of repetitive negativity.
As you pay attention, you begin to see the sequence of your mental activity.
You go back to the breath and relax.
You take a few deep breaths and then begin to cultivate a wholesome state of mind.
There are countless ways to bring up wholesome states of mind.
One of the most powerful methods to use during meditation is to remember any skillful act that you have done in the past and the pleasant states of mind that went with that action.
For example, perhaps you once helped an elderly woman who was trying to cross a busy street.
She was struggling with a bag of groceries, and the cars were going by too quickly for her to cross.
You did not know her, and you had no interest in any reward or even any thanks.
At that time, your mind felt light, free, relaxed, and happy.
Having brought these feelings to mind, you reflect, “This is the state of mind I should cultivate.” S
o you use that memory to encourage positive feelings to arise and grow strong.
You can use the memory of any good deed you’ve done, so long as there’s no attachment involved.
These kinds of acts brought you happy feelings when you did them, and you can let the same good feelings fill the mind when you think back on them.
Perhaps you helped a child who got separated from his mother at the grocery store, or you assisted an injured animal along the road.
Maybe you saw two people in a bitter argument over some tiny matter, and you helped them resolve it.
Perhaps in your job you have caused young people to become enthusiastic about learning.
Another option is to recall with gratitude the good deeds that others have done for you, or to reflect on famous accounts of good deeds.
On recalling these things, your mind fills with wholesome states and you become relaxed, happy, and contented.
Another method for cultivating wholesome states of mind is to recall your past successes in battling greed, hatred, or delusion.
For instance, you remember a time when your child really upset you and you felt like smacking him.
Then mindfulness came up, you recalled that acting out of anger is not what you are supposed to be doing.
Your fury abated and you calmed down and became peaceful.
You remember this great change from seething anger to pleasant calm, and you reflect on how good it felt.
You say to yourself, “This good feeling is something I want to cultivate.”
This recollection helps you relax and fills you with quiet joy.
You can assemble your own toolbox of reliable methods to raise up wholesome states.
Perhaps you notice that whenever you recall the time that your child took his or her first steps, you get a rush of loving emotion.
Tuck that memory into the box.
In the future, you can use that feeling as a springboard for cultivating wholesome states of mind.
This technique of mindful effort to cultivate positive states of mind is useful not only for meditation.
You can use it while eating, walking, working, talking.
You no longer have to merely hope that life will give you reasons to feel happy.
Recall what worked in the past—and what failed.
Uncover the cause and effect of these simple mental processes.
Then cultivate these pleasant wholesome mental states in everything you do.
For example, while washing dishes you can cultivate thoughts of loving-friendliness for those who will use the dishes.
When starting a conversation you can stay on your toes by being mindful of possible results of positive or negative speech.
This is called a “well-started” conversation.
By relaxing and bringing every ounce of patience, loving-friendliness, compassion, and insight into the conversation, you make it go more smoothly, benefiting yourself as well as others.
If you have a bad temper, for example, and you recognize it, that recognition is wholesome.
Then you can cultivate pleasant states that will keep your temper from arising.
When a challenging situation arises, such as a visit from an irritating executive of your company, you can remind yourself of possible pleasant or unpleasant outcomes of your actions.
Then you make a determination to remain relaxed and filled with loving-friendliness.
If the executive says or does something annoying, you get to enjoy your pleasant state of mind instead of engaging in a painful display of anger.
Likewise, if you know you tend to fret, prepare yourself.
Before your grandchild takes her first airplane flight, do whatever has worked in the past to overcome fretting and bring up good feelings.
Then you need not suffer as result of her flight.
You can enjoy pleasant states instead.
It’s a self-taught skill.
The more we deliberately bring up enjoyable states of mind, the more interesting it becomes, and the better we get at it.
Every day, every moment, we can cultivate unbounded loving-friendliness, sympathetic joy, deep compassion, and profound equanimity.
These four wholesome qualities bring the mind into such a wonderful, high feeling that they are called “divine abidings.”
Someone who knows how to bring them up can enjoy heaven on earth anytime.
Maintaining Positive States of Mind
Ideally, once you arouse a wholesome, skillful state of mind, you will maintain it and not let it disappear.
You know that if you let it slip away, your mind will go back into neutral and then maybe fall into some unwholesome state.
So, you do whatever you can to keep that pleasant state of mind going continuously.
This moment’s wholesomeness should be the wholesomeness of the next moment, and the next hour, day, week.
You try to keep your positive state of mind alive, like someone trying to keep a special candle burning.
This is not easy.
I will never gamble again, never steal, never kill any living being.”
Or after one good meditation session or an inspiring spiritual retreat, you may have thought, “This retreat was wonderful.
I never thought meditation was so easy.
All these are positive thoughts.
After a few hours, the water goes flat.
You lose your enthusiasm and return to your old habits.
In order to maintain your initial effort, you must develop strong mindfulness.
Remember that nothing important can be perfected by doing it only once.
You have to repeat a positive thought or action again and again until your practice becomes perfect.
You have to practice very diligently.
Whenever your effort slackens, recall occasions when you applied continuous effort until you achieved your goal.
Of course, there are some practical things you can do to support your practice of Skillful Effort.
You can associate with good friends and avoid foolish people.
You can live in a suitable location, read inspiring books, keep in touch with Buddhist discussions.
You can also practice mindfulness diligently.
These actions can help maintain your good thoughts.
Let me tell you a story of a monk who made a great commitment and great effort.
In ancient India, there was an elderly monk who was a great master.
A monk slightly junior to him failed in a duty.
The owner of this house was well known for his stinginess and hostility toward mendicants.
When this monk appeared at his house for the first time, the owner got very upset.
He gave a standing order to his wife, children, and servants not to give the monk anything—and not to talk to him or even look at him.
The monk returned to the monastery without receiving any alms from that house.
When the monk returned to the house on the second day, the same thing happened.
No one gave him any food.
He returned to that house day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year for seven long years.
Then the owner of the house hired a new servant woman.
She did not know anything about the standing order not to give alms to this monk.
One day in the seventh year, when the monk went to this house, the new servant woman spoke to the monk, saying, “Go away.
We don’t have anything to give you.”
The monk was very pleased to have been acknowledged at last.
On his way back to the monastery, the monk passed the stingy owner of the house riding home on his horse.
In a contemptuous voice, the man asked the monk, “Did you receive anything from my house?”
“Yes, sir, thank you,” the monk replied.
“I received something today.”
The stingy man became very angry.
He went around to each person individually asking the same question.
When he came to the new servant woman, he asked her, “Did you give anything to that monk?”
“No, sir,” she replied.
“Are you sure?”
“I did not give him anything.”
“Did you speak to him?”
“What did you say to him?”
“I said, ‘Go away.
We don’t have anything to give you.
The stingy man thought that the monk had deceived him.
This thought made him even more angry.
The next day, the monk appeared at the house as usual.
The stingy owner came out and spoke to the monk in anger, “Yesterday you said that you received something from my house.
I checked with everybody and found that no one gave you anything.
Tell me what you received from my house.”
“Sir, I came to your beautiful house for seven years and received nothing.
But yesterday, one kind lady came out and said, ‘Go away.
We have nothing to give you.’
That was what I received from your house.
The stingy man felt so embarrassed.
In that instant, he saw the spark within himself of loving-friendliness and generosity.
This monk must be a saint, he thought.
The owner immediately changed his order and asked the people in his house to give the monk some food.
After that, the monk continued to receive alms from that house.
His determination, his Skillful Effort to maintain his patience, and his positive state of mind paid off in the end.
The newborn child in that house later became an arahant and one of the most important Buddhist leaders of that time.
You may wonder why we make so much effort in our practice and in our lives, when everything is impermanent anyway, and even the highest mental states eventually fall away.
You’re right, of course.
Everything is impermanent.
Moreover, there is no permanently existing “you” to experience things.
Yet suffering and happiness do happen.
If you step on a wasp and are stung, you don’t think “I” am hurting.
Some people get confused when they hear the doctrine of no-self.
They tend to believe that for suffering to happen there must be “someone” who suffers.
Yet this assumption is mistaken.
So long as there are aggregates of body and mind, suffering inevitably exists—until enlightenment is reached.
It is said,
It is only suffering that arises,
Suffering that persists, and suffering that passes away.
Nothing but suffering comes to be,
And nothing but suffering ceases.
Another misconception is the idea that since there is no one to feel the suffering, suffering does not matter.
I say, “Whether there is a self or not, you suffer.
After all, suffering is why, after his enlightenment, the Buddha devoted himself to teaching others for the rest of his life.
Out of great compassion, he showed others the mental training that removes all suffering states.
It is true, too, that even the higher, more pleasant and refined mental states fall away at some point.
That is why once we cultivate skillful states, we must put them to work while we’ve got them.
Skillful states of mind are the necessary means for uprooting suffering, and maintaining skillful states yields benefits lasting long beyond any temporary relief and joy.
Clear, wholesome states of mind are the basis for developing insight into impermanence, so that we can uproot craving and ignorance once and for all.
They forget the big picture and get caught up in interesting details of the Buddha’s teaching.
They take some idea they have heard and run with it, to the point of absurdity, and then do self-defeating, unskillful things.
Instead of becoming happier, they increase their suffering.
Instead of becoming mindful, she tried to oppose her feelings directly.
At meal times she tried not to feel greediness.
She even tried to eat less than she needed and supplemented her diet with protein drinks.
So instead of ordinary greed, she developed a neurotic aversion and became despondent.
A good friend reminded her that she should remember the big picture and cultivate wholesome states of mind.
The friend suggested ways to break out of the despondency: reading a good book, taking hikes, doing good deeds, or keeping busy with work.
This young lady responded fiercely, “But I don’t want to escape reality!” Doing what is needed to break the grip of unwholesome states is not escaping reality.
It is escaping a worsening of suffering.
You must continually ask yourself, “What, in this moment, am I cultivating?”
One time the Buddha’s aunt, the nun Maha Pajapati Gotami, asked the Buddha for brief advice to guide her practice.
The Buddha told her to do whatever she knew from her own experience and common sense to lead to good qualities in herself.
The things you do, he said, should lead to:
dispassion, not passion
disentangling, not entanglement
dispersion , not accumulation
wanting little, not much
contentment, not discontent
peaceful solitude, not gregariousness
effort, not laziness
being easily supportable, not fussy and demanding VI.3)
This list offers us a good guide for making sure that our efforts are useful according to the big picture.
Here is another rule of thumb we can use to judge our efforts.
As the Buddha told us, the basic teaching of all Buddhas has always been, “Do good, do no evil, and purify the mind.”
When the mind is plagued by negative thoughts, meditation practice is very difficult.
Other people tend to yawn and feel that they can’t stay awake.
Those in the habit of anger may feel resentment or nagging hatred while they try to meditate.
When desire for sensual pleasure troubles your mind, mentally dissect the object to which you are attracted.
Think of how the pie will look after it has been digested.
Reflect on these things over and over again until your desire fades.
The same technique can be effective if your desire is for a person.
Consider the compound nature of the body—its bones, intestines and other organs, phlegm and other body fluids.
But if this technique somehow inflames your desire, stop immediately and concentrate upon the breath.
When anger arises, apply the antidotes we have discussed, such as becoming aware of your anger, recognizing the impermanent nature of all emotions, contemplating the benefits of patience, reasoning with yourself to see a different perspective, and cultivating feelings of loving-friendliness.
When dullness or sleepiness arises, visualize a bright light.
Take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can, then slowly breathe out; repeat several times if necessary until your heart pounds and you break into a sweat.
Meditate with your eyes slightly open.
Get up and practice standing meditation, or do walking meditation.
Go wash your face with cold water.
If nothing works, go have a short nap.
When restlessness or worry arises, reflect on tranquillity, calmness, or peace.
Bring your mind back to the breath and anchor it there.
Take a few deep breaths and feel the breath at your nose and in your body.
Take another.
Direct your attention to your buttocks or the bottoms of your feet and feel the weight of your body.
When doubt arises, reflect on the Buddha’s enlightenment, the timeless nature of his teachings, and the attainment of enlightenment by his disciples.
If you have been engaged in speculative thinking, drop the useless topic and reflect upon some aspect of the Buddha’s teaching.
Focus on what you know to be true about impermanence, about suffering, about your lack of control of anything.
Keep your attention on the present moment.
When your greed fades away, you feel as though you have paid off a debt.
When your hatred fades away, you feel as though you have recovered from an illness.
When your sleepiness and drowsiness fade away, you feel as though you have been released from prison.
When your restlessness and worry fade away, you feel as though you have been freed from slavery.
And when your doubt fades away, you feel as though you are no longer lost in a desert and have arrived at a safe and secure place.
You feel happy at the moment when your negative mind states disappear, and you feel happy later on whenever you think about their disappearance.
When you remember how much pain and suffering your hindrances and fetters caused you in the past, you feel happy to see that they no longer make you feel uncomfortable.
Your mind is peaceful and calm.
You looked forward to this state of mind.
Now you have achieved it, and you are very happy.
When negative thoughts fade away, the mind is ready to cultivate positive thoughts.
When wholesome thoughts arise during meditation, watch them mindfully without getting attached to them.
Thoughts that should be encouraged during meditation include friendliness, compassion, generosity, appreciative joy, understanding, peace, tolerance, determination, patience, and service to all living beings.
When such thoughts fade, renew your effort to cultivate them, remembering why they arose in the first place.
The roots of all these good thoughts are in your mind.
They have simply been suppressed by negative conditioning.
Using Skillful Effort to prevent and overcome negative states of mind and to cultivate and maintain positive states is like climbing a mountain.
Before you begin your climb, you take precautions to prevent problems from arising on the way.
You make sure that you are fit physically and psychologically.
You pack some medicine in case of sudden illness.
These measures are like the Skillful Effort of preventing negative states of mind from arising.
Despite your precautions, however, problems will arise.
When you are tired, you rest.
If you get a high fever, you take the medicine that you have brought along.
These actions are like overcoming unwholesome states of mind as they arise.
You keep your energy up by resting, eating right, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding overexertion.
These positive activities are like cultivating wholesome mental states.
When, after great difficulty, you reach the summit, you feel great relief, satisfaction, and joy.
You rejoice that you have, with effort, managed to achieve your goal.
You may say, “I am glad that is over,” or, “I am glad that I was able to overcome all difficulties.”
Similarly, when you cultivate wholesome mental states and maintain them, you rejoice that your struggle is over and that you will never have to struggle with unwholesome states again.
This is how Skillful Effort leads to joy.
Happiness is right there when you make the effort to achieve it.
Remember your goal, and do not abandon your efforts until you become totally happy.
Say to yourself:
Happy, indeed, we live, friendly amidst the hateful.
Amidst hostile men, we dwell free from hatred.
Happy, indeed, we live, in good [mental] health amidst the ailing.
Amidst ailing men, we dwell free from ill.
Happy, indeed, we live, free from greed amidst the greedy.
Amidst greedy men, we dwell free from greed.
Although rarely emphasized, Skillful Effort is essential to your spiritual progress.
Fetters are deeply entrenched unwholesome tendencies of mind that arise out of greed and keep beings fettered to suffering states.
The ten fetters are belief in a permanent self/soul, doubt, belief in the efficacy of rules and rituals, greed, hatred, desire for rebirth in material form, desire for rebirth in immaterial form, conceit, restlessness and worry, and ignorance.
Hindrances are intense, gross manifestations of fetters.
You should use Skillful Effort to prevent and overcome the five hindrances: greed, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt.
The ways to overcome a hindrance are: to ignore it, to divert your attention, to replace the hindrance with its opposite quality, to reason with yourself, and, if all else fails, to crush it with all your might.
Until they are destroyed, the fetters can only be suppressed.
Fetters are weakened by mindfulness and concentration; development of their opposites weakens them more.
When fetters are finally broken, this brings about the stages of enlightenment.
To prevent negative thoughts from arising, maintain mindfulness.
Mindfulness is developed through morality, the practice of mindfulness, wisdom, patience, and effort.
To overcome arisen negative thoughts, just notice them.
If you fail to notice negative thoughts quickly, they gather strength, and you must drop everything and pay total attention to them.
Try reflecting on the harm they cause and the impermanence of whatever triggered them, or replace them with positive thoughts.
When negative thoughts have faded away, cultivate wholesome thoughts by recalling how helpful such thoughts are and by deliberately creating thoughts of friendliness, determination, patience, and so forth.
Use whatever methods you know to develop wholesome states of mind.
Don’t get lost in the details of practice and forget the big picture.
Always make sure your efforts actually bring more wholesome states.
Adjust your lifestyle to support maintaining wholesome thoughts, being sure to do such things as gathering with like-minded friends and reading Buddhist texts.
Without strong mindfulness, your mind quickly reverts to its old habits; thus you must diligently repeat your efforts to maintain the wholesome thinking that will make you happy.
STEP 7 - Skillful Mindfulness
MINDFULNESS is paying attention from moment to moment to what is.
Because we unknowingly perceive ourselves and the world around us through thought patterns that are limited, habitual, and conditioned by delusions, our perception and subsequent mental conceptualization of reality is scattered and confused.
Mindfulness teaches us to suspend temporarily all concepts, images, value judgments, mental comments, opinions, and interpretations.
A mindful mind is precise, penetrating, balanced, and uncluttered.
It is like a mirror that reflects without distortion whatever stands before it.
The Buddha often told his disciples to “keep mindfulness in front.”
By “in front” he meant in the present moment.
This means more than just staying clear about what the mind is doing while we are sitting in meditation; it means clearly understanding every single physical and mental movement we make throughout every waking hour of every day.
It means, in other words, being here, now.
The present moment is changing so fast that we often do not notice its existence at all.
Every moment of mind is like a series of pictures passing though a projector.
Some of the pictures come from sense impressions.
Others come from memories of past experiences or from fantasies of the future.
Mindfulness helps us freeze the frame so that we can become aware of our sensations and experiences as they are, without the distorting coloration of socially conditioned responses or habitual reactions.
Once we learn to notice without comment exactly what is happening, we can observe our feelings and thoughts without being caught up in them, without being carried away by our typical patterns of reacting.
Thus mindfulness gives us the time we need to prevent and overcome negative patterns of thought and behavior and to cultivate and maintain positive patterns.
It gets us off automatic pilot and helps us take charge of our thoughts, words, and deeds.
Moreover, mindfulness leads to insight, clear and undistorted “inner seeing” of the way things really are.
With regular practice, both in formal meditation sessions and as we go about the activities of our daily lives, mindfulness teaches us to see the world and ourselves with the inner eye of wisdom.
Wisdom is the crown of insight.
Opening the wisdom eye is the real purpose of mindfulness, for insight into the true nature of reality is the ultimate secret of lasting peace and happiness.
We need not search for it outside ourselves; each of us has the innate ability to cultivate wisdom.
A traditional story underscores this point:
Once there was a divine being who wanted to hide an important secret—the secret of happiness.
He thought first of hiding the secret at the bottom of the sea.
But then he said to himself, “No, I cannot hide my secret there.
Human beings are very clever.
One day they will find it.”
Next, he thought of hiding the secret in a cave.
But he rejected this idea as well.
Then he thought of hiding the secret on the highest mountain.
But then he thought, “People are so curious these days.
One day someone will climb the mountain and discover it.
At last he devised the perfect solution.
I’ll hide my secret in the human mind.
This deity hid the truth in the human mind.
Its goal is to find the truth hidden within us—at our very heart and core.
According to the Buddha our minds are naturally luminous.
In each moment, as consciousness first arises, its spark is bright.
In the unenlightened mind, however, that spark gets covered up by the impurities of greed, hatred, and delusion.
These impurities obstruct the mind’s brightness, leaving the mind dark and miserable.
We cannot say that the mind is already pure.
We must do the work to make it that way.
We have to cleanse this luminous mind to let it shine without any impurities blocking its brightness.
Wisdom cultivated through mindfulness burns away the obstructions of greed, hatred, and delusion.
The more we remove them, the more the mind becomes comfortable, happy, and radiant.
Mindfulness also keeps impurities from arising.
Therefore the deeply hidden secret of happiness is this truth: Happiness comes from within our own minds through the use of mindfulness to clear away greed, hatred, and delusion.
This secret of happiness is revealed as the layers of impurities are peeled off through wisdom.
As we mindfully observe, we begin to see how each of these aggregates comes into being, grows, matures, decays, and dies.
For instance, this beautiful body whose health we guard so carefully is changing at every moment.
The heart is beating; the lungs, kidneys, liver, and brain are performing their functions.
While these physical components are changing, feelings, perceptions, consciousness, and mental objects are also arising and passing away.
Mindfulness of the present moment grants us insight into these changes—into the pervasive impermanence of all that exists.
Noticing the impermanence of all phenomena gives us the opportunity to see the dissatisfaction that change engenders.
For instance, bring to mind some wonderful feeling that you had in the past.
As we see how everything is slipping away—body, feelings, the people and things we love—not just every moment but many times every moment, we gain insight into the cause of our dissatisfaction and unhappiness: attachment to things that are constantly in flux.
Finally, mindfulness grants us insight into the way beings, including ourselves, really exist.
Insight into impermanence and dissatisfaction helps us see that reality is not something “out there,” separate from us.
Rather, reality is our ever changing experience of the ever changing world—the world within us and the world we perceive through our senses.
Practicing mindfulness makes quarreling with the world seem ridiculous.
We do not cut off our hand when it does something wrong.
Quarreling with the world is like one arm fighting with the other, or the right eye battling the left.
Life, we discover, is not a static entity.
It is a dynamic flow of incessant change.
When we look for the meaning of life, all we can find is this change.
As we return to this dynamic aspect over and over again, we find no permanent or eternal entity in it—no permanent or eternal self or soul within us to cling to, and no permanent or eternal self or soul within others to quarrel with.
Thus mindfulness grants us insight into the three characteristics of all things: impermanence, dissatisfaction, and the nonexistence of an eternal or unchanging self or soul.
Looking within ourselves, we see how quickly our physical form is changing, and we see how dissatisfaction is brought about by these changes.
We see how fervently we wish not to have any more births, not to grow older or fall ill, not to experience sorrow, despair, or disappointment.
We see how dissatisfying it is to want to be associated with things or persons we like and how dissatisfying it is to want not to be associated with things or persons we do not like.
We see that any desire, no matter how subtle or how noble, causes pain.
We see that even the desire connected with the wish to overcome desire—although wholesome and necessary for progress—is painful.
Ultimately, we see that our sense of self, the personal identity we protect so fervently, is an illusion, for we are a process, a constant flow of physical, emotional, and mental events new each moment.
Hindus express this truth vividly when they speak of three deities—Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer.
The creator is the arising moment; the preserver is the peak moment; and the destroyer is the passing-away moment.
Every moment something is created; every moment something exists; and every moment something is passing away.
There is no static moment, because nothing, even for a fraction of a second, stays the same.
This cycle goes on incessantly.
When unpleasant, painful, or unbearable states surface, we let them pass without becoming upset.
We just let things happen without trying to stop them, without succumbing to them or trying to get away.
We just notice things as they are.
We see, not only with the eye of wisdom but even with our everyday awareness, that all things and beings depend for their existence on constantly changing causes and conditions.
Since there is nothing permanent to attach to and nothing permanent to push away, we relax into perfect peace of mind, perfect happiness.
Skillful Mindfulness is the incorporation of our whole life into meditation practice.
The mindfulness techniques that follow are based on a discourse given by the Buddha to his disciples on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.
In it, the Buddha taught many methods of meditation.
He made clear that whoever practiced mindfulness in these ways would be sure to attain the lasting happiness of enlightenment.
The variety of techniques the Buddha taught are daunting only to those who do not understand the Buddha’s system.
Actually, the practices are geared toward the kinds of activities we encounter every day.
Moreover, the Buddha’s system is based on his profound understanding of the way the human mind operates.
Consider a little baby.
It is cute and wonderful but also very demanding.
A good parent keeps the baby occupied and stimulated by making sure the baby has a selection of interesting toys and a variety of things to do.
Our minds are similarly demanding, and our attention span sometimes seems as short as a baby’s.
The Buddha understood this.
He gave us a whole list of things to do.
When the mind moves to something unwholesome, we quickly give it something better, the way a skillful parent gives a toddler a ball while taking away the scissors the child has picked up.
When the mind moves to a wholesome subject, we encourage it.
Anything that comes up in the mind becomes the object of mindfulness meditation.
We can use any subject to further our insight into the three characteristics of everything that exists: impermanence, dissatisfaction, and the nonexistence of an eternal self or soul.
When whatever we are thinking of naturally fades away, we turn our mind back to the original object of meditation.
Do not expect the mind to stick to this or that thing.
The mind is naturally fickle.
It goes from object to object.
But do not shift from object to object deliberately.
Begin with your focus on a chosen object of meditation, such as the breath, and turn to another object only if something else comes up spontaneously.
Let’s say you are focusing on the breath, and then a thought arises about the healthiness of your skin.
As that thought passes, the mind will catch the next breath.
If the mind remains focused on your skin, you engage in thinking about the impermanence of skin—how fragile it is, how it is always changing and will become full of wrinkles.
You also think about how useless and painful it is to cling to your skin, since it will change no matter what, and the more you cling, the more you suffer.
You also consider the selflessness of the skin—that there is no “you” in it or controlling it.
Then you watch as these thoughts disappear.
You also notice that the observing function that is mindfully aware of these thoughts is itself impermanent.
When all thoughts have subsided and nothing else jumps to mind, you let the mind return to the breath.
Whatever new ideas arise, you examine them in the same way.
Practicing in this manner, eventually the thoughts cease, and the mind gains concentration.
The Buddha’s many meditation techniques are like a fully stocked medicine cabinet.
You cannot swallow all the medications at once, nor can you practice everything in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness all at once.
You start with whatever technique you feel comfortable using.
Then you use whatever comes up in the process of working with that object of observation or reflection.
Your mind may seem chaotic now, but it will settle down.
When your mindfulness becomes strong and sharp, the mind will naturally begin investigating the more profound aspects of Buddha’s teachings.
The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are:
mindfulness of the body
mindfulness of feelings
mindfulness of the mind
mindfulness of mental objects
Meditating on the breath gives your mind and body a little time to settle down.
Then, as other foundations of mindfulness arise, we become aware of them.
No matter what subject arises, make sure that you pay attention to the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of your experiences, whether they are physical or psychological.
Thus far, we have spoken only of the breath as an object of meditation—and indeed it can take you all the way to perfect freedom.
But other objects can also be used.
Mindfulness of the Breath
The Buddha always recommended that one start insight meditation with mindfulness of breathing.
The breath is the one object that is both consistently present and yet also changing in a way that naturally draws the mind’s attention.
When the mind is united with the breath, you are naturally able to focus the mind on the present moment.
You can notice the feeling arising from the contact of the breath with the rim of the nostrils.
You can notice the long inhaling and long exhaling of breath.
You can notice when the length of the breath changes, and air flows in and out a little more rapidly than before.
You can notice when a series of short breaths is interrupted by a deep breath.
You can notice the expansion and contraction of the lungs, abdomen, and lower abdomen.
Noticing these aspects of breathing keeps the mind continuously engaged in the present moment.
Observing your breathing with mindfulness can also teach you many things about how your mind works.
The calmness you get as a result of inhaling is interrupted by exhaling, and the calmness you get as a result of exhaling is interrupted by inhaling.
Yet, if you hold the inhaled breath a little longer than usual to prolong that feeling of calmness, you experience tension, and if you wait a little longer than usual before inhaling again to prolong that feeling of calmness, you experience tension.
Waiting even longer before inhaling or exhaling might even cause pain.
Observing this, you see that you desire calmness and the release of tension and want to avoid the discomfort of waiting too long before inhaling and exhaling.
Because the tension does not go away as fast as you would like, nor the calmness stay as long as you would like, you get irritated.
Thus just by observing the breath, you see how even a small desire for permanency in an impermanent world causes unhappiness.
Moreover, since there is no self-entity to control this situation, your wishes for calmness and a lack of tension will be forever frustrated.
However, if you relax your mind and watch your breathing without desiring calmness and without resenting the tension that arises, experiencing only the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of the breath, the mind becomes peaceful and calm.
While you are practicing mindfulness of the breath, the mind does not stay with the sensation of breathing.
It goes to sense objects such as sounds, and mental objects such as memories, emotions, and perceptions.
When you experience these other objects, you should forget about the breath for a while and focus your attention on them—one at a time.
As each fades away, allow your mind to return to the breath, the home base for the mind after quick or lengthy journeys to various states of mind and body.
Every time the mind returns to the breath, it comes back with deeper insight into impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness.
They are not here for you to get attached to them.
Mindfulness of Posture
Mindfulness of posture means sitting, standing, walking, and lying down with mindful attention.
When I sit, I sit.
When I lie down, I lie down.
I know what I’m doing.
What special knowledge or insight can I gain by focusing my mind on sitting, standing, walking, or lying down?” As you pay mindful attention to the postures of the body you see that your physical movements are always changing, even if you seem to be holding still.
Your heart pulses, heat radiates from your body, your lungs expand and contract.
Cultivate awareness of their impermanence.
You may notice that you have only limited control over the outward movements of your body, and that there is no control at all over the subtle, internal bodily movements.
Lack of control is frustrating.
Seeing this, you cultivate insight into the suffering and selfless nature of the movements of the body.
Also notice the physical elements that make up the body and the things that you contact—for example, the heaviness and solidity of the earth element.
See how all these physical elements change constantly.
Notice how everything in your physical experience is impermanent.
However, just as in mindfulness of breathing, do not focus only on physical change.
When any mental factors become prominent, turn your attention to them.
The feelings and perceptions created by your physical movements are changing; notice their impermanence.
If, while sitting, standing, walking or lying down, you notice thoughts of greed, dislike, or confusion—or of compassion, loving-friendliness, or appreciative joy—watch as the thoughts rise and fall.
You cannot create, nor can you stop, the automatic occurrences of the rising and falling of movements, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and consciousness.
Keeping these things in mind as you move, notice the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all experience.
In every posture and in every activity, be it reaching for a doorknob, walking through a mall, or lying down to sleep, continue to cultivate insight into these characteristics of the five aggregates.
You can refine your ability to see into the characteristics of the aggregates by practicing slow-movement meditation.
Think of the slow-motion video replay of a sports game.
When the action of the game is moving at normal speed, we miss many subtle details, but during the replay, we can see clearly the terrific block made by one player or the foul committed by another.
Similarly, when we move slowly, as we do in slow walking meditation, we notice the many changes of posture that make up the action—lifting the heel, resting the foot, carrying it forward, moving it, touching the floor.
If you have been engaging for a while in sitting meditation focused on the breath and decide to practice mindfulness of slow movement in walking, here’s what you do:
Stand up slowly, continuing to pay attention to the breathing process.
While you are standing up, be aware of the changes in your physical sensations and perceptions.
While standing, continue to pay attention to your breathing.
Now, while breathing in, lift the heel of one foot, and while breathing out, rest that foot on its toes.
Next, while breathing in, lift the entire foot and move it forward, and while breathing out, slowly lower it and press it against the floor.
For instance, you see that the physical actions that make up walking begin with mental intentions.
You see the intention to lift the foot, the intention to move it forward, and the intention to lower it and touch the floor.
Simultaneous with these intentions, actions are taking place.
Intention and action happen together so quickly that there is no time to see the interval between an act and the thinking behind it.
Of course, nobody thinks of all these steps in the process of walking.
Yet, when you slow the sequence down and look at each action mindfully, you see that many different actions must come together for walking to take place.
When the intention of walking arises in the mind, energy is created, which is discharged through the body via the nervous system.
Many different nerve cells cooperate in conveying the message, and many other body structures carry out the processes that are needed.
Muscles contract and extend, joints flex, and balance is maintained by other complex mechanisms.
In all this you see clear evidence of impermanence.
For instance, you intend to lift the right foot, but when you lift it, that intention is gone, and as you lift it, the sensation you had before the lifting is gone.
When you rest the right foot on the toes, you have one sensation, and when you move it forward, that sensation is gone, and a new sensation arises.
You see that the mind is always changing as well.
When your weight is evenly balanced, your mind may have a feeling of comfort and equilibrium.
But then, as your weight shifts, that feeling changes.
The mind waits for another comfortable moment to arise.
But when that next moment of comfort and equilibrium arises, it too passes away.
Each time a comfortable moment changes into an uncomfortable one, the mind is disappointed.
The repetition of comfortable and uncomfortable moments makes you tired.
Tiredness is a nagging kind of dissatisfaction that builds up slowly during any repeated sequence of changes.
While paying attention to the movements of walking, you are also aware of the ever changing flow of thoughts.
While you are walking, you may experience fear, insecurity, tension, worry, lust, anger, jealousy, or greed.
The thought may arise, “This is going very well.
I hope everyone notices how well I’m doing.”
Such thoughts come from pride or craving for recognition.
You have already learned how to take care of them.
First you simply become mindful of them.
If they persist you apply the methods for overcoming negative mind states that you practiced during sitting meditation.
Then you proceed to cultivate wholesome mental activities by letting go of greed and hatred and by generating loving-friendliness, appreciative joy, and equanimity.
It is always important to take steps to overcome any negative states that arise.
I remember a young meditation student confessing to me what happened while he was engaging in walking meditation behind a young woman.
After the session ended, he approached me and said sadly, “Venerable Sir, there was a girl walking in front of me.
I met this same fellow again years later.
His mind was still messy and undisciplined.
You are also aware of various feelings, thoughts, and states of consciousness as they arise.
You will not find any satisfactory answers to these questions.
Your mind tells you that your “I” is the one who is lifting the right foot, sliding it forward, and pressing it to the floor.
But it is also “I” who is standing, breathing, seeing, hearing, thinking, remembering, feeling, and engaging in multitudes of other activities at every moment.
These movements and activities are changing so rapidly that you cannot notice them all.
“I breathe in” is different from “I walk,” which is different again from “I see” and “I remember” and “I feel sad.
” In none of these activities can you find an “I” that is independent of the things you do.
You will begin to see that “I” is a concept that we use for the sake of convenience to refer to an ever changing flow of experiences.
It is not a single independent entity that exists in the body or the mind.
The concept of “I” changes many times a day, depending on the activity “I” is engaged in.
It does not exist on its own even for a minute.
“I” exists only when you think of it.
Thus walking slowly and mindfully can be a complete meditation that shows how impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness pervades every moment.
These same techniques can be applied to the postures of sitting, standing, and lying down.
The point isn’t merely to put the body into slow motion but to analyze the way the mind and body cooperate in producing the posture, and to see the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of mind and body.
While we are paying close attention to the posture, we have a good opportunity to study what goes on in the mind, to see whether states such as greed, hatred, jealousy, or fear arise.
These things become easier to spot when the mind is not distracted.
Once you train yourself to watch for these negative states during meditation sessions on the various postures—standing, walking, sitting, and lying down—you can bring the same vigilance to every activity in everyday life.
We do not ordinarily look at the body in this analytical way.
The Buddha referred to this meditation by a Pali word that means “going against the grain.”
By this he meant that in doing this meditation, we go against the normal way we think about the body.
This meditation can help get rid of these deluded notions.
It helps us see the body as it is, without rejecting it or clinging to it.
In addition, the Buddha listed ten bodily processes associated with fire and with air.
The four bodily processes associated with fire are the heat of digesting food, the heat of aging, the bodily burning sensation , and the temperature of the body.
The six processes associated with air are belching , passing gas , air in the digestive tract, air in the pores of the body, the inhaling breath, and the exhaling breath.
In a way, this meditation is very much like the way a biologist looks at the body.
A biologist dissecting an animal does not run away when the animal’s liver or intestine is exposed.
The biologist wants to see what this organ is and how it operates.
We should cultivate this same kind of emotional detachment as we perform this meditation.
When you consider the hair on the head, for example, ask yourself, “Did I have hair like this when I was five years old?” The answer, of course, is no.
Then ask yourself what happened.
This is reality.
But you can do these things without arrogance, without obsessive clinging.
As you become aware of the disintegration of the body—its strength becoming feeble, its beauty becoming ugly, its health becoming diseased—you see that change happens to all bodies.
You see that there is nothing permanent about the body to which you can become attached.
Instead of getting upset, you become humble in the face of this truth.
The reality of the body’s impermanence is so powerful, so crushing, so overwhelming that you automatically surrender.
You have no choice but to accept it.
Thus this meditation also helps you overcome the fetter of conceit in the existence of a permanent self.
Moreover, you see that everyone facesthe same fears of old age, sickness, and death.
Seeing the universality of this condition helps you overcome your personal fear and develop tender compassion for the suffering of others.
This realization gives you insight into the compound and dependent nature of everything that exists.
When you compare your body with those of other people, you also see that what is true about your body is true of everyone else’s.
Your body gets old, falls sick, and grows weak.
All bodies do this.
What happens to your body due to hormonal changes, injuries, or other conditions happens to other people’s bodies, too.
In this respect you and others are not different at all.
This insight helps you to cultivate equanimity and to treat all living beings with compassion and loving-friendliness.
We tend to think, “I feel!” without realizing feelings are impersonal phenomena.
They come and go due to conditions that trigger them.
When we understand the different kinds of feelings and the way they function, we can prevent the conditions that lead to very painful and confused mental states simply by relaxing and altering our attitudes.
Our minds stay pleasant and clear.
But this is just the beginning.
When we see the true nature of feelings we become more detached and less reactive to whatever feelings arise.
It is an exercise in letting go of greed and aversion.
Letting go, we dig up the very root of our suffering and advance toward full enlightenment.
We often assume that persons or situations outside us are responsible for what we feel.
However, mindfully watching our feelings teaches us that both pleasant and painful emotional feelings come not from the objects that we perceive but from our own mental state or attitude.
You can prove this to yourself by remembering that when several different people see the same movie, they each have a different set of feelings about it.
Thus we can stop blaming other people and external events for our sorrows and begin to look inside—where we truly have power to change things.
This is what the Buddha’s invitation to “come and see” means.
When you become familiar with your own feelings, you can also compare your feelings more easily to those of other people.
You note that just as you develop various kinds of feelings based on circumstances, so do others.
Just as your feelings pass away, so do those of others.
The knowledge you gain from mindfulness about your own feelings is called “direct insight.”
The knowledge you gain from comparing your experiences with those of others is called “inferential understanding.”
Although there is no way of knowing for sure how others feel, inferential understanding helps you gain much insight into reality.
When we remember that all living beings have feelings, that they all experience emotional and physical pain, suffer from cold and hunger, and feel sad or lonely, we become less selfish and less inclined to defend our own feelings as right.
We can listen patiently to complaints of pain without complaining.
When we are mindful that all beings have the same feelings we do, how can we say or do something to hurt someone else?
In each moment the whole cycle of suffering is powered by the mind’s unenlightened reactions to feelings.
All living beings, without exception, feel, and all unenlightened beings suffer from their reactions to their feelings.
Feeling arises from the periphery of the body due to contact with the outside world and also from deep in the mind due to contact with mental events.
From the moment our nerve cells began to develop, we experienced feelings.
Feeling is present even for a baby in the womb.
When the mother moves, the baby she carries inside feels the movement.
When she sings, the baby hears her and is lulled.
When she is angry, the baby feels her agitation and tension.
When she laughs, the baby feels her delight.
While we may not be able to recall these feelings, we experienced them.
Moreover, every aspect of our lives—our struggles, achievements, inventions, work, and very survival—depends on how we feel.
The drive for food, clothing, medicine, shelter, sex, and physical comfort depends on feelings.
Human beings have discovered, manufactured, or developed many things because of feelings.
When we feel cold, we seek warmth.
When we feel hungry, we look for food.
We procreate according to our feelings.
Even our thinking often starts with a feeling.
We rationalize our emotional reaction to a situation by saying, “I have every reason to feel angry about what happened.
When a feeling is pleasing, greed arises; you want more.
When a feeling does not please you, you react with aversion, rejecting it.
When a feeling is neutral you tend to ignore it with a deluded quality of mind.
As we have pointed out, greed, hatred, and delusion—or just greed, for short—is the source of all suffering.
Mindfulness of feeling is an opportunity to explore this source, where we can let go of suffering.
Let’s say you sit with the intention of watching the rise and fall of breath—along with feeling, perception, thoughts, or consciousness—for forty-five minutes.
But after twenty-five minutes or so, pain arises in the middle of your back and your mind shifts to watching the pain.
If you keep still and watch the pain, eventually it peaks and then breaks up.
When the pain breaks, a pleasant feeling arises.
You can observe the way the mind hangs onto that pleasant feeling, wanting more of it.
Then some other kind of feeling replaces that pleasant feeling.
As feelings arise and pass away you may notice how volatile feelings are.
When the mind loses interest in these feelings, you go back to watching the breath.
You can see that we do not need a special kind of sitting meditation in order to practice mindfulness of feelings.
Rather, we carry on with our usual mindfulness meditation and observe the arising and passing of feelings in just the same way we observe the passing of thoughts.
We continue this practice in our everyday life.
Whether in sitting meditation or going about our daily life, whenever a feeling arises that is strong enough for the mind to be drawn to it, we examine it.
When we become mindful of our feelings, we no longer have to mindlessly react to them.
We become more skillful.
If a pleasant feeling arises, we can subdue the underlying tendency of pleasant feelings—greed.
If a painful feeling arises, we can subdue the underlying tendency of that kind of feeling—aversion or hatred.
If a feeling is neutral, we can recognize that fact and not allow the underlying tendency of neutral feelings—delusion—to emerge.
The Buddha described two broad categories of feelings: “worldly” and “unworldly.
” Worldly feelings are feelings with the underlying tendencies of greed, hatred, or delusion activated to some degree.
These feelings lead directly into greed, hatred, or delusion.
Worldly feelings inevitably arise in the pursuits of mundane, ordinary life such as enjoying pleasures, seeking wealth, looking for a companion, seeking a position, or building up recognition and power.
The feelings that arise from such activities always trigger some amount of greed, hatred, or delusion.
The Buddha repeatedly warned his disciples that worldly pursuits and worldly feelings are dangerous due to these underlying tendencies.
He urged us to become aware of the danger of the underlying tendencies and to abandon them.
With mindfulness we stop ourselves from getting so carried away by the greed, hatred, or delusion.
We make an effort to subdue these tendencies—by watching them.
We pay attention to them with a relaxed mind, not trying to force anything, but simply letting go.
The moment we do this, we experience unworldly feelings.
Unworldly feelings arise in the pursuit of the spiritual path of liberation.
These feelings come with the underlying tendencies fully suppressed or—in the case of an enlightened being—eliminated.
Whenever we transcend a worldly feeling we are left with an unworldly feeling.
Let us look at the pleasant, painful, and neutral aspects of both worldly and unworldly feelings.
Worldly pleasant feelings are very familiar to us.
Sense pleasures bring us a wealth of pleasant worldly feelings.
For example, a delicious meal, an entertaining TV show, or a shiny new car usually evoke pleasant worldly feelings.
Unless your mindfulness remains very strong, pleasant sensations of body and mind will be worldly, because we like these things and want to experience them more and more.
Unworldly pleasant feelings may be less familiar.
They arise whenever we do something that propels us along the path to liberation.
Consider, for example, the feelings of peace and happiness we get from deep concentration.
The pleasant, peaceful feelings we experience when our mindfulness meditation practice is going well are also unworldly feelings.
When we use mindfulness to let go of a worldly pleasant feeling, such as the feeling that comes from eating tasty food, unworldly feelings arise.
Be skeptical, however, of anyone who says you can mindfully enjoy sensual pleasures.
That is not the Buddha’s way.
The Buddha taught us to mindfully let go of sense pleasures and enjoy the pleasant unworldly feelings that come from letting go.
To let go, we remain mindful of the impermanent nature of these sensual pleasures.
Thus we remain detached, and this detachment evokes unworldly pleasant feelings.
Whenever we let go of some greed, hatred, or delusion, pleasant unworldly feelings will arise.
In fact, any action we take along the Buddha’s eight steps may lead to the arising of some pleasant unworldly feelings.
As our mindfulness develops, we experience unworldly pleasant feelings more often.
Imagine that you have some objects to which you are greatly attached, such as the belongings of some dear friend who died.
Whenever you look at these objects, feelings of grasping or sadness arise, and you suffer.
When you succeed in letting go of these objects it is a big relief, for then those feelings stop.
You relax, and a pleasant feeling arises.
It is as though you were gripping something, and the more you tightened your grip the more it hurt.
Then you opened your hand and you felt great relief.
Unworldly pleasant feelings arise because you let go of grasping.
Painful feelings can also be either worldly or unworldly.
Worldly painful feelings lend themselves most easily to aversion.
For example, painful feelings of anger or resentment may arise when our ambitions are blocked, such as when we are passed over for a promotion.
The methods we have discussed for overcoming anger can help when such painful worldly feelings come up.
Unworldly painful feelings may arise when we are engaged in practicing the Buddha’s path.
Say that you have really understood the Buddha’s message and want very much to free your mind from greed, hatred, and delusion.
You have practiced meditation, observed all the precepts, and followed all the instructions.
Yet, you feel that you are not making progress toward your goal.
The frustrated and painful feeling you experience in this case is unworldly in nature.
However, unlike other kinds of painful feeling, this is wholesome.
It does not come out of greed, hatred, or delusion.
It becomes an urge to experiment and continue.
Neutral feelings can also be categorized as worldly or unworldly.
In the context of worldly pursuits, a sluggish, unconcerned feeling pervades moments that do not have the highs and lows of pleasant or painful feelings.
Delusion can thrive in these neutral worldly feelings.
When your mindfulness leads you to recognize that what you call the “self” or “soul” is always changing, always subject to impermanence, the feeling you get is neutral and unworldly.
You feel alert and interested in seeing what will unfold next.
You do not fall into this or that camp of emotion—neither desiring nor averse—but stay equanimous and mindful.
The longer you remain in that state, the stronger mindfulness becomes.
Let’s recall the example of meditating with lower back pain.
At first there is aversion toward the pain, followed by pleasant feeling and grasping at pleasant feeling.
If you continue to watch the feelings, you will see them change again and again.
Eventually, on seeing the impermanence, you let go of your reactions of grasping and aversion.
Then equanimity toward feelings will arise.
This equanimous state is an unworldly neutral state.
If we are experiencing an unworldly feeling, we make an effort to cultivate the feeling.
We note the causes of that feeling so that we can recreate similar causes in the future.
Then we work to recreate the right conditions.
Again and again we figure out the varying circumstances and actions that will lead to that unworldly feeling.
We deliberately develop a habit of bringing up this kind of feeling.
On the other hand, if we see that we have a worldly feeling wrapped up in the underlying tendency of greed, hatred, or delusion, we make a strong effort to overcome these underlying tendencies of the feeling.
We become very mindful not to get carried away with the unwholesome state that is arising from the feeling.
We mindfully watch the worldly feeling without reacting, until it eventually subsides.
In the process we can see the impermanence of everything involved: impermanence of the desirable objects, of one’s opinions regarding the situation, of one’s own body and of one’s ability to enjoy the pleasures involved, and the fleeting nature of the feelings themselves.
By observing impermanence in this way, we can let go.
When we let go, the worldly feeling is replaced by a pleasant unworldly feeling, and we become mindful of the absence of greed, hatred, and delusion at that time.
Then the mind may return to the breath, or it may continue to observe the changing unworldly feelings.
Happiness arises.
The mind settles down, becomes calm and peaceful, and happiness increases.
Happiness leads to a deeper level of concentration.
Suppose, for instance, you wake up one morning feeling sad.
Rather than becoming upset, you sit down in a quiet place, close your eyes, and spend some time watching your sadness without any presumption or worry, but paying total attention to this painful worldly feeling.
If you allow yourself to become attached to the cause of your sadness, the painful feeling lasts longer.
But if you watch your feeling, you notice the truth of your sadness.
Then you learn to diminish greed, hatred, and delusion.
When you accept the reality of change that takes place during every moment of feeling, you are reminded that, fortunately, even painful feelings are impermanent.
Pleasant unworldly feelings arise.
Thus your general mood changes from sadness to a calm, happy, peaceful feeling.
Now the mind is clear and can easily gain concentration.
You look at this unworldly pleasant feeling as it is, paying total attention to it for as long as it lasts.
But you do not try to make the feeling permanent.
So long as attachment does not arise, the feeling will continue to predominate, even for days.
When it begins to fade, you let it go.
As you continue to be mindful of your feelings, you learn that you cannot force a pleasant feeling to stay for however long you wish.
Paradoxically, the harder you try to keep a pleasant feeling with you, the quicker it disappears.
If you simply watch your feelings as they come and go, your mind relaxes and becomes more comfortable.
You also maintain your emotional equilibrium more easily.
When we mindfully observe any feeling, it will peak and break.
That feeling is then replaced by another feeling, which also peaks and breaks.
If you begin with a pleasant feeling, the next feeling may be an unpleasant feeling, or a neutral feeling, or another pleasant feeling.
Observing any of these changes gives us insight into our true nature.
Mindfulness of the mind refers to watching various mental states arise and pass away—the greedy or nongreedy mind, the hateful or non-hateful mind, the ignorant or discerning mind, the contracted or expanded mind, the distracted or focused mind, the scattered or concentrated mind, the undeveloped or developed mind, the unliberated or liberated mind.
You observe such states as they appear and disappear along with consciousness appearing and disappearing.
It’s impossible to separate consciousness from the mind states and mental objects, because they arise and pass away together.
You can, however, notice when consciousness has been affected by negative mental qualities such as greed, hatred, confusion, depression, or restlessness, or by positive qualities such as generosity, patience, or loving-friendliness.
You give each mental state total attention as it arises, without doing anything specific about it and without allowing yourself to get involved or to follow the thought or feeling.
You simply watch as each state or quality rises and falls.
This rising and falling is the nature of the entire mind.
Every moment—in fact, many times every moment—mind arises, reaches its peak, and passes away.
It is the same for any mind of any being in the universe.
The more you observe this rising and falling of all mental qualities, the more volatile you know them to be.
Seeing this volatility, you gain insight into the impermanent phenomena called “mind.
Thus the more you focus on mind itself, the less solid it seems.
Like everything else that exists, it is always changing.
Moreover, you discover, there is no permanent entity; no one is running the movie projector.
All is flux, all is flow, all is process.
In reality, who you are is simply this constant flow of changing moments of mind.
Since you cannot control this process, you have no choice but to let go.
In letting go, you experience joy and you taste for an instant the freedom and happiness that is the goal of the Buddha’s path.
Then you know that this mind can be used to gain wisdom.
Mindfulness of mental objects may sound like a new kind of meditation practice, but it is just another way of describing the insight practice that you are already doing.
“Mental objects” refers to thoughts—which here means all conscious mental activities.
Thoughts have several categories: there are fetters, hindrances, the five aggregates of existence, factors of enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths.
They may arise in any order.
In sitting meditation, while practicing with your intended object of meditation, such as the breath, you quickly become mindful of any thought that arises, such as the hindrance of doubt or an aspect of one of the aggregates.
That mental object—the thought—becomes the new, temporary object of your meditation.
You simply notice the mental object and watch it fade.
Or, if it is unwholesome and it persists, you do whatever is necessary to get rid of it.
As the mental object disappears, you note that it is characterized by impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness.
Then you return your attention to the breath or your chosen object of meditation.
When the next thought arises, you repeat the process.
Note that you do not determine in advance what kinds of mental objects you will turn to during the meditation.
Nor is there any need to categorize what arises, thinking, “I am observing a fetter.
” When observing wholesome mental objects such as joy, you do what you can to encourage such thoughts to keep coming, but you also continue to observe the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of these states.
As we mentioned before, however, mindfulness meditation practice is not limited to the meditation cushion.
In any posture, no matter what you may be doing, you can become aware of any mental activity as it arises.
As you try to maintain continuous mindfulness every day, unwholesome mental activities eventually occur less frequently, and wholesome ones occur more frequently.
Since you spend less time getting lost in negative thinking, it becomes easier and easier to stay abreast of the actions of the mind.
As you train yourself to be mindful for most of your waking hours, one day you will see that your mindfulness is steady and strong.
Your mind is very clear, and you begin to see how everything you experience fits into the Four Noble Truths.
When this happens, the Four Noble Truths have become the object of your mindfulness.
As your mindfulness improves, you naturally begin to observe factors of enlightenment—the qualities of mind necessary to achieve the goal of the path.
The Buddha practiced for many lifetimes to reach the utmost perfection of these factors in order to become a Buddha.
The Seven Factors of Enlightenment are mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.
You have been cultivating these factors all along.
As your mindfulness improves, they simply reach a higher level.
The Seven Factors of Enlightenment are traditionally presented in the order in which they arise, because the development of each factor leads to the next.
When mindfulness is steady and strong, you notice its strength, and it becomes your object of meditation.
You know that you are mindful.
Thus mindfulness becomes a mental object of mindfulness.
This awareness of your mindfulness sheds more light on your own experiences of form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness, so that you can see them more clearly.
Encouraged by this awareness, you continue your mindfulness training.
Mindfulness is what you have been practicing all along as you have been developing on the path of the Buddha.
Mindfulness is one of the cardinal factors of that path.
Eventually, after much work, you come to a point at which your mindfulness becomes deeper, clearer, and stronger, and you know that your mindfulness is established.
Now, mindfulness has been raised to the level of a factor of enlightenment.
With mindfulness you have been discriminating between wholesome and unwholesome objects.
You have been observing the characteristics of objects that you experience, finding them characterized by impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness.
In the course of these efforts you have been developing habits of investigation into truth.
You become aware of this.
Then your mental object is investigation of all phenomena of life.
Your enhanced mindfulness acts like a flashlight to illuminate objects in the dark.
With the beam of powerful mindfulness focused on your experience of an object, you investigate and see that object’s impermanent nature.
As that object disappears, another object arises, revealing the same truth of impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness.
As you continue to look for the truth and continue to find all experiences to share the same three characteristics, your investigation becomes a factor of enlightenment.
As everything you investigate continues to reveal this truth, zeal arises to see more.
The mind is filled with energy.
At this point your mindfulness is strong, as though crystallized.
All along you have been making effort—to develop mindfulness, to remove unwholesome states, to encourage wholesome states, and to work hard to accomplish every step of the path.
Now your readiness to make effort reaches its fruition: the enlightenment factor of energy.
You sense the energetic readiness of the mind to tackle any task, and energy becomes your mental object of mindfulness.
The mind remains active yet relaxed.
Wholesome desire arises to bring up this energized quality of mind again and again.
The more you energize yourself to see the truth, the more you become pleased, even joyful.
You feel so pleased because you are no longer in conflict with reality.
Thus the joy factor of enlightenment becomes the new object of mindfulness.
Joy yields to contentment, which leads to happiness.
Happiness brings peace and tranquillity.
Thus tranquillity arises as a factor of enlightenment.
Continuing to see the same truth, on every level, in every conceivable experience, you relax.
The mind was once in constant agitated motion like a flag on a mountain top.
Now restlessness has given way.
Calmness comes.
Deep, powerful concentration arises.
Earlier you may have had deep, powerful concentration; this is the same.
But now the mind is ripening, and you can use this concentration to achieve stages of enlightenment.
Thus concentration becomes a factor of enlightenment.
At this stage the equanimity factor of enlightenment takes over.
Before, there always was some subtle desire for things to be other than they are.
You think, for example, “I wish this beautiful experience would continue.”
That subtle desire ends when the mind is in an equanimous state.
When impermanence is very clear, you don’t hope that the next moment will not be impermanent.
When the unsatisfactory, suffering nature of things becomes clear, you do not wish that the next moment will be satisfactory.
When the impersonal, uncontrollable, selfless nature of things becomes clear, you have no expectation that the next moment might be different.
With equanimity, the mind does not have even a trace of desire to see things in any way other than how they are.
The mind is completely united with truth.
This is how the Four Noble Truths line up with the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.
You see suffering exactly as it is.
You see the cause of suffering exactly as it is.
You see the end of suffering exactly as it is.
And the path that you have been developing all along up to now—this, too, you see exactly as it is.
Whenever each of these factors of enlightenment do not arise, you become aware of this.
Whenever they do arise, you become aware of this and cultivate them, until you come to this level of perfection.
When each of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment has been perfected, we achieve nibbana, perfect happiness, perfect peace.
We can achieve this goal within this life.
When we do, all suffering ceases.
All questions come to an end.
All anxiety, worry, fear, and tension disappear, never to return.
There is no craving, no clinging to anything.
We live in perfect harmony, perfect balance.
All our senses are sharpened.
We still eat, drink, talk, walk, and use our body and mind, but with full awareness, total mindfulness.
Our morality does not make us think we are superior to others.
Our concentration does not make us praise ourselves and disparage others.
Our wisdom gives us perfect loving-friendliness, perfect compassion, and perfect appreciative joy.
Enjoying perfect equanimity, we are never again troubled by life’s ups and downs.
Mindfulness is paying moment-to-moment attention to what is.
Mindfulness grants you insight into the three characteristics of all existing things: impermanence, dissatisfaction, and the nonexistence of an eternal or unchanging self or soul.
You can use any object to further your mindfulness, so long as it helps you gain insight into these three characteristics.
The deep purpose of mindfulness is to open the wisdom eye, for insight into the true nature of reality is the ultimate secret of lasting peace and happiness.
The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feelings, mindfulness of the mind, and mindfulness of mental objects.
Mindfulness of the breath can help you learn to focus, as the breath is easy to observe and always present.
Walking slowly and mindfully can be a complete meditation that reveals how impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness pervade every moment.
The same meditation can be used for other postures, such as sitting, standing, and lying down.
Maintaining mindfulness of posture throughout the day trains the mind to see clearly the characteristics of the five aggregates.
Pleasant and unpleasant emotional feelings come from our own attitudes, therefore we can stop blaming others for how we feel.
The whole cycle of suffering is powered by the mind’s unenlightened reactions to the three kinds of feelings—grasping at pleasant feelings, rejecting unpleasant ones, and experiencing a deluded sense of “self” in neutral ones.
“Worldly feelings” arise from mundane pursuits and have underlying tendencies toward greed, hatred, or delusion.
“Unworldly feelings” arise from insight and lack any underlying tendencies.
Seeing the impermanence of feelings, we learn to let go of the underlying tendencies of greed, hatred, and delusion, and to cultivate unworldly feelings.
The Buddha did not teach us to “mindfully enjoy” sense pleasures.
He taught us to mindfully let go of desire for pleasurable worldly feelings and to enjoy the pleasant unworldly feelings created by this detachment.
When you cultivate mindfulness of mind, you notice the rising and falling of mental states, such as greedy and nongreedy states of mind, contracted and expanded states of mind, and so forth.
Mindfulness of mental objects means noticing the arising and falling away of the five hindrances, the ten fetters, the five aggregates, the Four Noble Truths, and the factors of enlightenment.
You can regard the factors of enlightenment as the fruits of mindfulness practice.
As your mindfulness deepens, they arise in this order: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.
When all of the factors of enlightenment have been perfected, we achieve nibbana, perfect happiness, perfect peace.
STEP 8 - Skillful Concentration
SKILLFUL CONCENTRATION is the last essential step on the Buddha’s path to happiness.
When the mind is serene, peaceful, and concentrated, the hindrances that block our happiness do not arise.
Moreover, when we sit in meditation, we are able to focus our concentrated mind on the mental objects that arise with consciousness.
Concentration helps us pierce right through the superficial appearance of these objects to a clear perception of their impermanence, the dissatisfaction they bring, and their lack of a permanent or unchanging self or identity.
With skilled concentration, our meditation practice accelerates, and we make rapid progress on the Buddha’s path.
Generally, when we say that someone is “concentrating,” we can mean anything from being engrossed in a television show to strate-gizing in a chess game to plotting a crime.
This kind of concentration does not happen right away.
Like any other skill it must be learned step by step.
The mind must be trained.
It may take anything from several sessions of sitting meditation to several years of effort to develop concentration that is wholesome, one-pointed, and mindful.
Once we do achieve this full concentration, we must repeat the training steps over and over until we are able to bring up Skillful Concentration easily and at will.
We mentioned at the beginning the importance of finding a good teacher to guide your practice.
A teacher can offer great assistance as you work to develop full concentration.
Many questions may arise as you try to refine your ability.
If a good teacher is not available, the next best thing would be to read books devoted entirely to the subject.
Furthermore, it is hard for the mind to settle down enough to reach full concentration so long as you continue dealing with the daily problems of ordinary life.
We recommend that you set aside specific periods of time to practice full concentration, such as a week during which you will not be interrupted by duties.
Attending a retreat focused on concentration practice may be the best way to begin.
Not all concentration is wholesome.
Think of a cat waiting to pounce, focusing its attention on its prey.
The cat has intense concentration, but it is not wholesome.
The wholesome concentrated mind is free of greed, hatred, and delusion.
In everyday life, we may use strong concentration to solve a mathematical problem, to repair a car engine, or to prepare a complicated recipe.
This kind of concentration can be wholesome if it is motivated by good thoughts such as generosity, loving-friendliness, or compassion.
It will be unwholesome if motivated by unwholesome states such as greed, aversion, or cruelty.
Unwholesome states, including the five hindrances, are present in everyday concentration more often than you may realize.
For instance, while you are trying to solving that math problem, you may be overly attached to getting a good grade on the exam; while repairing your car engine, you may be afraid of botching the job; while cooking your elaborate meal, you may be thinking angrily about a family member who will be eating it.
The kind of concentration taught by the Buddha is always free of the hindrances.
In sitting meditation, too, if concentration has been established while any hindrance is present, it is unwholesome.
For example, while sitting in meditation, you may achieve a little concentration while experiencing the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness.
You may be in a half-asleep, half-awake state, dreaming pleasant thoughts.
Later you may imagine that you reached some great attainment during your meditation.
This is delusion, not wholesome concentration.
Practicing concentration when there is some resentment in your mind is also unwholesome.
You’ll be able to tell when your concentration practice has gone wrong in this way because you will experience tension, worry, or strain.
Some meditators may even get a headache from forcing themselves to focus on their object of meditation despite the presence of irritation or some other kind of aversion.
You should always practice Skillful Effort to overcome such obstacles and to create a wholesome state of mind before continuing.
The worst mistake a meditator can make is to spend time in meditation concentrating upon grievances or other unwholesome thoughts.
Of course, bringing mindful awareness to these states is wholesome insight meditation.
Thus the first step in establishing Skillful Concentration is to make sure your practice is wholesome by blocking hindrances from the mind.
Here are the additional steps you should follow every time you sit with the intention of establishing Skillful Concentration:
For the period of your meditation, give up all thoughts of attachment to situations, ideas, people, and habits.
Do not think of your family, friends, relatives, job, income, bills, investments, properties, or responsibilities.
Tell yourself, “I choose to spend this very special period of time to better myself.
I did not sit down on this cushion to think all of my regular thoughts.
I will make good use of this time.”
Do not worry about anything you may have left undone, or about things you may have done incorrectly, or about ways you may have offended someone.
Remind yourself that the past is gone, and what is done cannot be undone.
Spend a few minutes cultivating thoughts of loving-friendliness to make the mind feel pleasant and better able to concentrate.
Then take three deep breaths.
Focus the mind upon your chosen object of meditation such as the breath.
Keep your mind in the present moment.
Make unremitting effort to pull your mind together.
If any of the five hindrances is present, overcome it using the methods you have learned.
Cultivate the wholesome state of mind that is the opposite of any hindrance that is present.
For example, if greed is present, cultivate the thought of letting go.
Let the mind become light and bright.
Once a hindrance has been overcome, refocus the mind upon the chosen object of meditation such as the breath.
Remember, the goal of this session is to practice your concentration technique.
At this point you should not look into the details of your experience but mindfully keep focusing on your primary object of meditation.
Each time you establish wholesome concentration, it gets easier, and you should feel encouraged.
No matter how short-lived or feeble the wholesome concentration may be, you have gained something by cutting through old habits and improving the mind.
While you are training the mind in concentration, you should feel happy about whatever level of wholesome concentration you have been able to achieve.
In sitting meditation, wholesome concentration brings energy, some stability, and the beginnings of confidence in the practice.
Joy arises because wholesome concentration keeps the hindrances suppressed.
Even in everyday life, a degree of wholesome concentration is necessary to living with good morality.
Wholesome concentration helps you focus on positive thoughts, speech, and actions and abstain from unwholesome ones.
Success in developing wholesome concentration depends upon a strong foundation of morality.
As your sense of morality improves, so will your concentration.
The concentration we have been talking about up to now is what we might call “ordinary wholesome concentration.
” This kind of concentration is relatively easy to achieve.
Yet, the insight that arises from ordinary wholesome concentration can transform lives.
It turns you away from unwholesome thoughts, speech, and behavior.
You lose interest in doing things that retard the liberation of mind.
This is why the Buddha said that wholesome concentration spearheads all wholesome mental states.
When the Buddha was still Prince Siddhattha Gotama, his father, the king, prevented him from seeing anything that might encourage him in a spiritual direction.
When the prince did finally see the four signs—an old person, an invalid, a corpse, and a renunciant spiritual practitioner—that marked a turning point for him.
Pondering these four things, Siddhattha reached a state of concentration.
Insight arose into the fact of suffering.
So he resolved not to return to the comforts and pleasures of his father’s palace but to seek a solution to human suffering.
The same can be true for us.
When we look upon them with wholesome concentration, common, everyday things can trigger the mind to ponder more deeply.
The insight that can come with ordinary wholesome concentration can convince you that you have been in the cycle of suffering for long enough and that it is time to begin a new page of your life.
You gain a new vision and knowledge of the suffering in your life.
You see the blindness of pursuing happiness through sense pleasures; you see through the satisfactions of material pleasure to their underlying stress and sorrow.
You no longer try to rationalize misery as pleasure.
The way out of misery also becomes clear.
Since ordinary wholesome concentration helps you see the truth of the Buddha’s message, you are motivated to develop more profound states of concentration so that you can attain deeper insights.
The profound concentration that can lead to the deepest realizations is called “full concentration,” or jhana.
Full concentration is always wholesome and possesses one-pointed, undistracted focus.
Note, however, that full concentration is not yet Skillful Concentration unless mindfulness is present.
With full concentration, your progress toward enlightenment is accelerated.
We are talking about concentration here in a very special sense.
Every time the mind focuses on any object, however insignificant, concentration arises.
But usually we just notice the big picture, not the little bits that make it up.
In the act of reading, for example, the eyes focus on one letter and then the next, or on one word and then the next, and then they send that information to the mind.
But we do not read letter by letter or even word by word.
The mind is so quick and its ability to concentrate so powerful that we take in whole lines or sentences.
If we slow the process down, we can become aware of each tiny moment of concentration.
The goal of concentration practice is to sustain awareness so that concentration flows into each succeeding moment of mind, consecutively, without gaps.
This level of awareness is difficult, however.
A moment of mind is so small that it is almost unimaginable.
Someone asked the Buddha to give an example of a moment of mind.
He replied that he could not give an example.
He said it is impossible to describe the rapidity, the swiftness of the moment.
He said that within such a short period of time, thousands and thousands of mind moments arise, mature, and pass away.
With this illustration, the Buddha was saying that the rapidity of the mind is virtually inconceivable.
Each of these fleeting moments of mind consists of three even briefer mind moments: the rising moment, the peak moment, and the dying moment.
Immediately after the dying moment, the next moment of mind arises, followed by its peak and dying moments.
These three briefer moments make one complete mind moment.
Ordinary concentration arises with only some of the mind moments—perhaps one in a billion.
A powerfully concentrated mind can see all the way down to the level of the arising, peaking, and dying of individual mind moments.
Once we directly observe the arising and passing of individual mind moments, we can no longer doubt the truth of the impermanence of all things, and we must let go.
That is why we need a completely concentrated mind in order to see reality clearly enough to attain enlightenment.
Full concentration has a number of stages or levels.
Actually, there are eight levels of full concentration or jhana that are accessible to people who are not yet enlightened, and any of them may be used to attain enlightenment.
For simplicity, however, we will limit our discussion to the first four levels.
At least the first level of full concentration is needed in order to develop the mental power necessary for insight into things as they are.
With the attainment of each of the next three levels, it becomes easier to see the truth.
At the second level, concentration is much improved due to the absence of thinking processes.
At the third level mindfulness becomes much more powerful, and at the fourth level even more so, being completely purified due to the presence of equanimity.
The First Level
To achieve the first level of full concentration, you must clear the mind of any of the hindrances and establish wholesome concentration.
Then five mental factors must come together: “initial application of thought,” “sustained application of thought,” joy, happiness, and concentration.
Any of these five factors may arise, alone or combined, under various circumstances.
For example, happiness arises whenever hatred disappears.
When sleepiness fades, “initial application of thought” may arise.
When restlessness and worry fade, joy may arise.
Whenever there is a moment of ordinary wholesome concentration, joy will arise due to the absence of hindrances, and some of the other factors may arise, too.
It is a wonderful feeling when any of these five factors arise.
You may think you are in heaven.
But this marvelous feeling is not jhana, nor do you get to jhana by bringing these factors together randomly, one by one.
A certain system must be followed to attain the first level of jhanic concentration.
This method begins with ordinary wholesome concentration.
The joy that you find in this state leads to happiness.
Joy and happiness are different emotions.
Joy arises in hopeful anticipation of happiness.
Happiness arises out of contentment when one’s hopes have been fulfilled.
Here’s an analogy that can help distinguish between joy and happiness:
You are walking in a desert.
There’s no water or trees or shade—just sand.
On and on you walk, tired and thirsty.
Then you see someone approaching with wet hair and clothes dripping with water.
Delighted, you ask, “How come you’re so wet?”
“I’m coming from an oasis right over there.
You walk toward the oasis.
When you first see the water, you feel joy.
As you get closer, your joy increases.
Then, you dive into the water head first.
You drink the water.
Then you rest along the bank, feeling cool and calm.
Normally, people associate happiness with excitement.
Say, for instance, somebody wins a lot of money in the lottery.
That person will express excitement by kissing, hugging, crying, jumping up and down.
That person thinks, “I’m so happy!” But this feeling is not true happiness.
It is excitement.
When true happiness arises, excitement disappears, and you feel relaxed and peaceful.
True happiness leads to tranquillity.
As the mind calms down, it naturally becomes more concentrated.
As your concentration deepens you can proceed to train the mind toward full concentration with these next steps:
Keep the mind steadily focused upon the breath or another object of meditation.
Do not, at this point, turn to examine other objects as they arise, such as sounds or thoughts.
Let go of whatever comes up and return to the breath.
Do this over and over, until the mind loses interest in all other things and stays with the object.
Eventually the breath or other chosen object seems to fade and is replaced by a memorized impression of it.
That mental image or feeling—called the “sign of concentration”—becomes your new object of meditation, and you stay with it.
When that mental image also fades and the mind concentrates upon itself, you have reached the first level of full concentration.
As you continue to focus on this object, it becomes so subtle that you do not notice it at all.
But at the place of focus, such as the tip of the nostril, the memory of the breath or other object of meditation continues.
This memory turns into a very pleasant sensation called the “sign of concentration.
” This sign may appear as a visual image, perhaps like a light, or as some other sensation, such as soft touch.
Exactly how this mental image appears is a very individual thing.
When you develop the sign, however it appears, stay with it.
Use the same image each time you meditate.
Do not tell anyone else your sign.
Everybody’s sign is different, and you will just make others confused.
At the beginning of your practice, your inhalation and exhalation were the object of your meditation.
Now you have the sign as the object of meditation.
Practice achieving the sign of concentration many times, until you gain full control of it, so that whenever you want to experience it, the sign is available and you can unite your mind with it.
When it first appears in your practice, the sign of concentration appears to be static.
Thus concentration can arise based on it.
But as you pay total attention to the sign, you begin to see that the sign itself is changing every moment.
Eventually, like all other conditioned phenomena, the sign itself fades away.
When the sign also disappears, the mind has no object but itself to focus on, so the mind becomes concentrated within itself.
In this moment, “initial application of thought” briefly occurs.
This is the beginning of wholesome one-pointedness of mind.
When initial application of thought is sustained for a few seconds, “sustained application of thought” can arise.
Now the mind stays steadily on the object.
Because the mind is no longer wandering here and there, a more refined quality of joy arises, closely followed by a more refined happiness.
These four factors trigger jhanic concentration.
Now the five factors of the first level of concentration or jhana—initial application of thought, sustained application of thought, joy, happiness, and concentration—are functioning together as a unit.
People often ask me, “How do I know whether I have attained the first level of jhana?” The answer is simple: as we said earlier, only when all five factors are functioning in unison can you say that you have attained the first stage of full concentration or jhana.
Imagine that you are looking for a rainbow.
Before you find one you may see a red color here, or you may see green or blue colors over there, or some color combinations.
They may be very beautiful, wonderful colors.
But that is not the phenomenon of a rainbow.
Until you have the right conditions of sunlight reflecting on the clouds, causing a prism to appear with all the colors lining up in the way that they must, you do not have a rainbow.
Similarly, until the conditions come together and all of the five jhanic factors line up, you do not have full concentration.
Some people have the idea that the concentrated mind becomes blank.
They imagine the mind of the meditator to be without feeling—just resting there like a stone.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The mind in full concentration is not static but dynamic.
In first jhana the mind has the following dynamic qualities:
equanimity, a balanced, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling
tranquillity, lack of concern with anything in the world, such as politics or your emotions
the mental factors of contact, feeling, perception, volition, and life force
zeal, decision, energy, and attention
The mind concentrated within itself has great, dynamic power.
Like a whirlpool, it gathers ever greater force by focusing in on itself and creating a powerful vortex.
This great power is called the “force of concentration.
” Think, for example, of hydroelectric power.
When a large amount of water is forced through a small opening, the force of the concentrated water is so powerful that it can move turbines with enough force to light up a city.
Yet, when the water is not focused upon an outer object, its power is gathered to itself.
Similarly, when the mind has no distraction to cause it to focus on some outer or inner object, it gathers its force in on itself.
Then the mind is like water forced through a small opening.
Its force of concentration is so great that it can directly observe impermanence at the most minute, fundamental, subatomic level of body and mind.
Full concentration is a wholesome state of such one-pointedness of mind.
This dynamic concentration is not the same as being “glued” to the object of meditation.
That would be attachment, which would make the mind waver.
Full concentration is not the mind uniting with the object; it is the mind uniting with itself.
The object is merely used as a springboard into the mind.
If the mind gets stuck on an object, that is not wholesome; it is concentration with attachment.
Unfortunately, that is the kind of concentration some meditators practice, but it cannot bring liberation.
They are like bath salts that dissolve so thoroughly into the bath water that you can no longer separate the salts from the water.
Similarly, when your entire body is fully charged with joy and happiness, you cannot separate your sense of body from those feelings.
Your feeling of peace is so great that you wish to stay in this state of concentration forever!
The Second Level
After attaining the first level of concentration, you are advised not to strive immediately for the second level.
This would be a foolish and profitless spiritual ambition.
Before you achieve the second level, you must bring the first level to perfection.
If you are too eager, you are likely to fail to gain the second level and may find yourself unable even to regain the first.
The Buddha compared such an overeager meditator to a cow who, while still unfamiliar with her own pasture, sets out for new pastures.
The foolish cow gets lost in the mountains without food or water and cannot find her way back home.
This is not the time to go seek a new high.
It is time to patiently train the mind.
Therefore, when you attain the first level of concentration, you should remember the steps you followed to attain it.
This is where your mindfulness comes in.
Mindfulness helps you remember the steps you followed to gain the first level of concentration.
If concentration seemed to happen to you all of a sudden, without your going through these steps, then what you experienced was not full concentration.
Some teachers might tell you that your have attained one of the levels of concentration.
Test this perception for yourself.
Do not simply accept the opinions that some people so freely pronounce.
Having reviewed the steps, you then mindfully determine to attain the first level again, determine to remain a little longer in that state of concentration, and determine when your period of concentration will end.
Having made these three determinations, you follow the necessary steps and practice attaining the first level of concentration many times.
As you repeat this procedure over and over, you lose interest in the initial application of thought and the sustained application of thought.
This change may occur in one sitting or over a number of sittings.
Suppose, for example, you attain the first level of concentration fifty times, and every time, you find the initial application and the sustained application of thought a little less interesting.
Then, in the fifty-first attainment, you skip these two factors completely and pay no attention to them because you have lost interest in them entirely.
The moment this happens, these factors disappear, and you attain the second level of concentration.
In the second jhana there is no more thinking to disturb the mind and disrupt its one-pointed focus.
The factors of jhana that remain are a stronger one-pointedness of mind, joy, and happiness.
The joy and happiness of the second level of concentration are less exuberant and more refined, for they are no longer based on the mind feeling pleased at being relieved of the hindrances.
Now the joy and happiness are based on concentration.
There is also a new sense of confidence that comes from your achievements up to this point—confidence in your ability to proceed, confidence in the method, and confidence in the Buddha’s message.
Concentration is strengthened.
Imagine a cool lake fed only by a spring welling up from below.
Just as the springwater wells up into the lake, in the second level of jhana the pure joy and happiness born of concentration continuously pour into the mind.
The Third Level
Using the same procedure as before, you repeat the second level of concentration many times.
When you first attained the second level of concentration, the joy you experienced was wonderful and refreshing.
Constant repetition, however, makes the joy seem monotonous rather than peaceful.
Gradually, you begin to ignore it.
As you ignore the factor of joy, it gradually fades away.
The moment joy fades from your mind, you have attained the third level of concentration.
Equanimity becomes stronger, and so does concentration.
This makes your mindfulness stronger and more stable.
Your mind becomes suffused with deeper and subtler degrees of happiness.
Think of a pond with water lilies growing just below the surface.
These flowers are born in the water, remain underwater, and are fed from the water’s depths.
They are thoroughly saturated, inside and out, their every cell completely full of water.
Similarly, in the third level of jhana, your body is completely saturated and filled with happiness.
In the second level, there was a certain amount of activity or excitement, like the movement of the refreshing springwater pouring into the lake.
But in the third level, you do not feel the need to be refreshed by happiness that seems to come from outside yourself.
Your refined happiness has a quality of stillness because happiness is merged completely with the body and mind.
The Fourth Level
As before, you repeat the third level of concentration many times, until you lose interest in happiness as well.
As happiness fades, your mindfulness becomes even more pure due to the presence of equanimity—the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling of perfect emotional balance.
You begin to find that mindfulness and equanimity are even more peaceful than happiness.
When you let go of happiness completely, you reach the fourth level of concentration, in which mindfulness is purified by the power of equanimity.
You recall that there was also equanimity at the third level, but because you had not yet let go of happiness, equanimity was not yet powerful enough to purify mindfulness.
At the fourth level of concentration, the mind is completely quiet, tranquil, and stable.
Because all negative mind states have been suppressed, the mind is imperturbable.
The mental purity and clarity suffusing your body is like a soft, pure white cloth gently wrapped around you.
The cloth is so pure and so gentle that you can barely feel it; but it protects you from insects, heat, wind, and cold.
Similarly, when the mind is pure and clear, nothing can shake it into grasping or aversion.
It remains equanimous.
Even if the body experiences insect bites, cold, or heat, the mind remains unaffected.
Even if someone pulls on your sleeve and talks to you, the mind ignores the intrusion, remaining concentrated and unperturbed.
At this point you have gained the real force of concentration.
The mind has consolidated, become pure, bright, free of hindrances, and steady.
It is malleable yet imperturbable, strengthened and sharpened for its most important task.
When you focus that concentrated mind on an object, you see the object as it is.
In other words, the perfectly concentrated mind can penetrate into the true nature of reality.
These four stages of full concentration are so pleasant that you may wish to immerse yourself in them for pure enjoyment, without directing the mind toward insight.
If you simply “bliss out” and fail to explore ways to use the concentration, however, you limit its power.
Your concentration remains wholesome, and there is nothing wrong with it.
But not putting your concentrated mind to good use is like receiving a gift of the world’s fleetest thoroughbred racehorse and using it only for quiet pleasure rides around your neighborhood.
Full concentration is too valuable a tool to waste.
If, while concentrated, you use your mindfulness to see reality, concentration can help you achieve liberation.
There are three skillful approaches to sitting meditation.
The first is to begin the session making an effort to attain full concentration.
Once full concentration is achieved you use it to practice insight.
That is, you use concentration to look into the impermanence, suffering, and selflessness of your form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness.
The second approach is to begin the sitting session with insight meditation.
When you start with insight meditation, whenever an object has caught your attention, you watch until it fades, observing its impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness.
Then you relax and return to your primary object of focus, such as the breath.
Each time you return to the breath, your concentration deepens.
If any hindrance arises, you overcome it, and this also deepens your concentration.
As your monkey mind slowly settles down, you lose interest in the objects that normally catch your attention.
These objects slowly fade from awareness.
Eventually the sign of concentration arises, then initial and sustained application of thought, and finally full concentration arises in the manner that we explained before.
In that fully concentrated state you continue with your insight practice, watching the impermanence, suffering, and selflessness of form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness.
A third approach is to begin with either insight meditation or the effort to attain concentration and switch back and forth between the two.
For example, let’s say you begin by focusing on the breath and ignore other objects in an effort to achieve concentration.
If concentration does not become established, frustration arises, and you use insight practice to observe the changes in the feelings of frustration.
When the frustration has subsided, you notice whatever other hindrances may have arisen.
Once the mind has steadied, you return to deeper focus, ignoring objects as they arise, again making the effort to achieve full concentration.
Thus in this third approach concentration and mindfulness act as a team gradually deepening your concentration and sharpening your insight.
Eventually, one day, when insight is nearly complete in its ability to see, and concentration is nearly full, they unite.
Thus, regardless of how you begin your sitting sessions, mindfulness and concentration, used skillfully, eventually merge and work together.
If you sit down to meditate and find that the hindrances are easy to overcome and the mind is quiet, it is good to begin with concentration.
On the other hand, if the mind is racing, unable at first to settle down, then you should not try to develop full concentration but should begin the session with insight meditation.
Or go back and forth between the two.
Your decision whether to start with insight or with concentration depends upon the initial steadiness of your mind.
Regardless of your initial approach, once there is unity of full concentration and powerful mindfulness you use them to shake off the first three fetters.
You see selflessness, thus losing your belief in a permanent, unchanging self.
You see the meaninglessness of rites and rituals.
You see the Four Noble Truths more clearly than ever before and lose all doubt in the Buddha’s path to awakening.
Using the concentrated mind is a little like using a laser beam to burn a hard substance.
To focus the beam effectively, you must use your eyes.
If you keep looking around the room, you cannot focus the beam properly, and you end up either burning the wrong thing or not burning anything at all.
Of course, if you fail to turn on the laser beam in the first place, nothing will get burned, even if you sit there looking at it all day!
In this analogy, the eyes are like your wisdom or insight.
The laser beam is like the mind when concentrated.
Wisdom and concentration work together.
Without insight, the beam of concentration will be scattered, or it may focus on the wrong thing.
Without the beam of concentration, the eyes of insight may see the object but not be able to burn through it.
Our unwholesomeness of mind.
We must see it with wisdom and burn it with a concentrated mind.
You pay attention to the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of these components.
When you pay attention to any one of these components, you see that all of them are always changing.
You see the connection between impermanence and suffering caused by your clinging to impermanent, pleasant experiences.
You see that what is impermanent and subject to suffering is selfless.
Seeing the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of your own form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness is the primary function of insight meditation.
When that function is fulfilled, you will be liberated from clinging to these aggregates composing the body and mind.
With nothing left to cling to, you become free.
When meditators cultivate sufficient concentration guided by mindfulness, they can trace back their mental images of events, time, thoughts, and previous behavior until they perceive the link between the present continuous flow and the events, thoughts, and actions of the past.
That link is greed and ignorance.
They see for themselves the relationship between impermanence, greed for impermanent things, and suffering.
The penetrating wisdom of the meditator also recognizes all negativities in all dimensions and how and why they arise.
Through this knowledge, the meditator comprehends by personal and direct experience that everything is impermanent, that clinging to anything impermanent causes dissatisfaction, and that everything that exists is without permanent substance.
Gaining this threefold knowledge is the doorway to enlightenment.
Putting Concentration to Use
On the night of his enlightenment, the Buddha did not develop powerful concentration and then ignore it; he put it to use.
In one heavily charged, powerful moment, the three realizations of impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness all came together and the Buddha achieved his goal.
Putting the realizations of concentration to use is the key.
It is said that Alarakarama and Uddaka Ramaputta, two former teachers of Siddhattha Gotama , had attained full concentration.
However, they did not train themselves to focus their attention on form, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness to see their true nature.
Rather, they became attached to the pleasantness of concentration and thought that this pleasurable feeling was enlightenment.
Siddhattha Gotama said that his former teachers, like him, had faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.
Like him, their wisdom had helped them understand the danger of the hindrances and the need to overcome them.
But unlike Siddhattha Gotama, the teachers did not see that they were using states of concentration merely to suppress hindrances, not vanquish them.
And they did not discover the underlying fetters—the forces that bind human beings to repeated rebirth.
Siddhattha Gotama alone had used his concentration to see clearly how the hindrances and fetters trap us.
And so, as you work to develop concentration, you push them out of the way.
However, the fetters, from which the hindrances spring, continue to exist in your subconscious mind.
The ten fetters, as you recall, are belief in a permanent self or soul, doubt, belief in the efficacy of rules and rituals, greed, hatred, desire for rebirth in material form, desire for rebirth in immaterial form, conceit, restlessness and worry, and ignorance.
These unwholesome mind habits remain dormant during your period of concentration.
Since the underlying fetters are still present in a dormant form, when you come out of concentration, the hindrances return.
When you wish to regain the same level of concentration, you have to push the hindrances out of the way again, though as you train your mind, it becomes easier to get past them.
It’s a bit like sweeping dust from a hard dirt floor.
Even though you swept earlier, in a few days, the dust appears again.
Bits of the floor’s surface continually break off, crumble underfoot, and become a thick dust.
To get rid of the dust you may sweep the whole building, or sprinkle the floor with water, or pour buckets of water that turn the floor to mud.
Nevertheless, the dust will return.
But if you dig down to bedrock and remove all the dirt, then pour concrete, dust and dirt will no longer be a problem.
Digging up all the dust and dirt is like insight meditation overcoming the hindrances and fetters.
Pouring concrete represents entering into enlightenment—making the mind firm, unmovable by worldly vicissitudes.
Once you have done that, nothing can shake the mind.
Siddhattha Gotama’s teachers, Alarakarama and Uddaka Ramaputta, did have wisdom.
They knew of the dangers of sensual pleasure and the benefits of full concentration, so they temporarily got rid of the hindrances and attained full concentration.
However, these attainments were not enough to liberate them from the fetters that bound them to repeated rebirth.
Concentration alone cannot get rid of the fetters.
To get rid of them, you have to combine full concentration with mindfulness and attention.
Otherwise you may simply get attached to the pleasure of concentration, as did Siddhattha Gotama’s teachers, and get nowhere.
The Buddha’s wisdom was very special.
With this wisdom he not only saw the dangers of sensual pleasure and the benefits of concentration, but he used that wisdom to go beyond full concentration.
He used his wisdom to discover that the hindrances he had transcended in this concentrated state were merely a symptom of a much deeper, stronger problem: the fetters.
He saw the way the fetters entangle and confuse the mind, creating a delusive reality and propelling onward the suffering sense of self.
In his purified mindfulness in full concentration, he saw the way to transcend the fetters: to see the impermanence, dissatisfaction, and selflessness of all conditioned things.
When you see these three characteristics in every aspect of your existence, then your greed, hatred, and delusion, along with the fetters, vanish forever.
Don’t Fool Yourself !
When we try to use the Buddha’s method in our practice, we must be careful not to fool ourselves.
Some people report that when they enter deep concentration, they do not feel anything, hear anything, or have any thoughts.
They say that they are absorbed so fully that they are not even aware that time is passing.
Often at our retreats I have seen such meditators rocking back and forth like small trees swayed by the wind.
Sudden descent into a nonfeeling state is not called concentration.
As soon as we ring the bell, these meditators come out of their “deep concentration” and say, “I had very wonderful meditation.
I managed to attain the fourth stage of concentration today.
If the meditator had reached any of the stages of full concentration, sleepiness would be banished and the mind would have all of the dynamic qualities mentioned above.
Full concentration is achieved deliberately.
You notice clearly what steps you took to get there.
Thus you can repeat the steps again later.
Full concentration comes in stages, and only when it is combined with mindfulness can it propel you along the path toward enlightenment.
Also, don’t fool yourself into thinking that concentration is the same as enlightenment.
Enlightenment is not so quick and easy.
You must go through the process of suppressing hindrances, gaining concentration, and combining that concentration with insight to destroy the hindrances and fetters.
No matter how long you sit in concentration—even in the most powerful level of concentration—without destroying the fetters, you cannot attain even the first stage of enlightenment.
Finally, don’t fool yourself into thinking that mindfulness alone is sufficient to take you to enlightenment.
You cannot say, “I do not care for concentration or morality.
I simply want to practice mindfulness.
” Mindfulness cannot be taken out of context or isolated from the other steps of the Buddha’s path.
People who do not practice the rest of the steps often find that they are unable to end their lust, hatred, and ignorance and thus are not successful in their mindfulness practice.
Be Patient
People who struggle to gain concentration in order to help their insight meditation sometimes worry when they cannot concentrate.
If your practice of awareness is guided by mindfulness, you can be content whether or not you gain full concentration.
Don’t try to force it.
Each time you meditate, you are getting closer to concentration.
How long it takes depends upon how often you meditate and how well you practice the other steps of the path.
Some days you may have better concentration and some days better mindfulness.
If you have gained full concentration in the past but did not practice it every day, and did not fully master it, then you may sometimes have difficulty when you try to achieve it again.
It may even seem impossible, if latent hindrances have become active, or if you have become involved in unwholesome activities.
On days when concentration is more difficult, you should simply be mindful of your active state of mind without worrying or verbalizing that you cannot concentrate.
The mindful observation of what is happening sharpens your penetrating wisdom into the reality of your experience.
So long as you keep practicing all the other steps of the path and keep trying—without attachment—to gain concentration, you can trust that Skillful Concentration will come eventually, and that by using this powerful tool, you will achieve ultimate happiness.
The key points for gaining happiness through Skillful Concentration are the following:
Skillful Concentration has three characteristics: it is wholesome, one-pointed, and it functions with mindfulness.
The Buddha gave us a step-by-step, gradual training method for attaining Skillful Concentration.
Wholesome concentration is concentration free of greed, hatred, and delusion.
It is free of the five hindrances.
To develop skilled concentration, first practice wholesome concentration by overcoming the hindrances.
Keep the attention on the breath or other chosen object and do not observe new objects that may arise.
After you have been practicing wholesome concentration for a while, your breath becomes very subtle and seems to disappear.
The memory of the breath at the place of focus, such as the tip of the nostril, turns into a pleasant sensation called the “sign of concentration.
“One-pointedness” refers to the mind concentrated upon itself after the sign of concentration has disappeared.
One-pointed mind is a factor of full concentration or jhana.
The first level of full concentration is marked by initial application of thought, sustained application of thought, joy, happiness, and concentration functioning in unison.
At least the first level of full concentration is necessary to achieve enlightenment.
Once you know how to attain the first level of concentration, determine to attain this level again, how long you will stay at the first level, and when you will exit from concentration.
Practice attaining the first level of concentration many times until you master it.
The second level of concentration arises when you have attained the first level so many times that you lose interest in the initial and sustained application of thought, and cause these applications of thought to disappear by ignoring them.
The third level of concentration occurs when frequent repetition of the second level causes the mind to lose interest in the joy of concentration.
As joy fades away, happiness is refined and deepened, and mindfulness and equanimity become more prominent.
The fourth level of concentration arises when you lose interest in happiness, and your mindfulness becomes purified by deep equanimity.
In full concentration the mind is full of wholesome and powerful dynamic qualities, not inert like a stone or like someone who is asleep.
Full concentration gives the quality and strength needed for insight meditation practice.
No matter how long you remain in the most powerful level of full concentration, that alone will not bring enlightenment.
To achieve enlightenment, you must remove the fetters.
You may begin a sitting meditation session with cultivating full concentration or with mindfulness practice, depending upon the steadiness of the mind that day.
Or, you may switch back and forth between the two.
No matter how you started the session, full concentration and mindfulness must come together to create powerful insight.
Powerful insight is necessary to see the impermanent, suffering, and selfless nature of all experience.
Insight allows you to see the role that greed plays in causing suffering and to let it go.
Full concentration alone or mindfulness alone cannot bring enlightenment.
Enlightenment can happen only when full concentration combines with mindfulness to break the fetters through insight.
It can take a few days or many years to reach full concentration.
Don’t be discouraged if it comes slowly, and don’t try to force it.
Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra
Dhṛtarāṣṭra said: O Sañjaya, after my sons and the sons of Pāṇḍu assembled in the place of pilgrimage at Kurukṣetra, desiring to fight, what did they do?
Sañjaya said: O King, after looking over the army arranged in military formation by the sons of Pāṇḍu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke the following words.
O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Pāṇḍu, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of Drupada.
Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhīma and Arjuna: great fighters like Yuyudhāna, Virāṭa and Drupada.
There are also great heroic, powerful fighters like Dhṛṣṭaketu, Cekitāna, Kāśirāja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Śaibya.
But for your information, O best of the brāhmaṇas, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.
There are personalities like you, Bhīṣma, Karṇa, Kṛpa, Aśvatthāmā, Vikarṇa and the son of Somadatta called Bhūriśravā, who are always victorious in battle.
Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhīṣma, whereas the strength of the Pāṇḍavas, carefully protected by Bhīma, is limited.
All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhīṣma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army.
Then Bhīṣma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.
After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.
On the other side, both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.
Lord Kṛṣṇa blew His conchshell, called Pāñcajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhīma, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell, called Pauṇḍra.
Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms.
Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Arjuna said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.
My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gāṇḍīva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.
O Janārdana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one’s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?
With the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.
When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Kṛṣṇa, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vṛṣṇi, comes unwanted progeny.
By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.
O Kṛṣṇa, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those whose family traditions are destroyed dwell always in hell.
Better for me if the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.
Sañjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.
Contents of the Gītā Summarized
Sañjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion, his mind depressed, his eyes full of tears, Madhusūdana, Kṛṣṇa, spoke the following words.
Arjuna said: O killer of enemies, O killer of Madhu, how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhīṣma and Droṇa, who are worthy of my worship?
Sañjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Kṛṣṇa, “Govinda, I shall not fight,” and fell silent.
O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kṛṣṇa, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.
Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.
O best among men , the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.
The material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.
Neither he who thinks the living entity the slayer nor he who thinks it slain is in knowledge, for the self slays not nor is slain.
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.
The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.
If, however, you think that the soul will always be born and die forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.
Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all.
Considering your specific duty as a kṣatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation.
If, however, you do not perform your religious duty of fighting, then you will certainly incur sins for neglecting your duties and thus lose your reputation as a fighter.
People will always speak of your infamy, and for a respectable person, dishonor is worse than death.
The great generals who have highly esteemed your name and fame will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only, and thus they will consider you insignificant.
In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.
When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.
When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness.
One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.
In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.
One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.
The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.
One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence.
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.
But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord.
As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intelligence.
Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.
What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires – that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still – can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.
A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego – he alone can attain real peace.
Karma-yoga
Arjuna said: O Janārdana, O Keśava, why do You want to engage me in this ghastly warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?
Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection.
Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.
One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.
On the other hand, if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by the mind and begins karma-yoga without attachment, he is by far superior.
In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Viṣṇu, and blessed them by saying, “Be thou happy by this yajña because its performance will bestow upon you everything desirable for living happily and achieving liberation.”
But for one who takes pleasure in the Self, whose human life is one of self-realization, and who is satisfied in the Self only, fully satiated – for him there is no duty.
Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.
For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties, O Pārtha, certainly all men would follow My path.
As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.
The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.
One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results.
Those persons who execute their duties according to My injunctions and who follow this teaching faithfully, without envy, become free from the bondage of fruitive actions.
But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not follow them regularly are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and ruined in their endeavors for perfection.
Arjuna said: O descendant of Vṛṣṇi, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force?
As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust.
Thus the wise living entity’s pure consciousness becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.
Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhāratas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization.
The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he is even higher than the intelligence.
Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence and thus – by spiritual strength – conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.
Transcendental Knowledge
The Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku.
That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science.
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion – at that time I descend Myself.
To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.
One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.
Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me – and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.
One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is intelligent among men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all sorts of activities.
Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independent, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of undertakings.
He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady in both success and failure, is never entangled, although performing actions.
The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.
A person who is fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature.
Some yogīs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.
Some sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of mental control, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses.
Others, who are interested in achieving self-realization through control of the mind and senses, offer the functions of all the senses, and of the life breath, as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind.
Having accepted strict vows, some become enlightened by sacrificing their possessions, and others by performing severe austerities, by practicing the yoga of eightfold mysticism, or by studying the Vedas to advance in transcendental knowledge.
All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the results of sacrifices, they advance toward the supreme eternal atmosphere.
O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?
Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries.
As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities.
A faithful man who is dedicated to transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses is eligible to achieve such knowledge, and having achieved it he quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace.
Karma-yoga – Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness
One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees analytical study and devotional service to be on the same level, sees things as they are.
One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water.
The yogīs, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.
The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.
When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates , neither working nor causing work to be done.
When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up everything in the daytime.
When one’s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.
The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater .
A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, who is unbewildered, and who knows the science of God is already situated in transcendence.
Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is well situated and is happy in this world.
Those who are beyond the dualities that arise from doubts, whose minds are engaged within, who are always busy working for the welfare of all living beings and who are free from all sins achieve liberation in the Supreme.
Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self-realized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.
A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.
Dhyāna-yoga
What is called renunciation you should know to be the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, O son of Pāṇḍu, for one can never become a yogī unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.
For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who is already elevated in yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means.
A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.
A person is considered still further advanced when he regards honest well-wishers, affectionate benefactors, the neutral, mediators, the envious, friends and enemies, the pious and the sinners all with an equal mind.
Thus practicing constant control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist, his mind regulated, attains to the kingdom of God by cessation of material existence.
There is no possibility of one’s becoming a yogī, O Arjuna, if one eats too much or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.
He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.
When the yogī, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence – devoid of all material desires – he is said to be well established in yoga.
As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent Self.
Gradually, step by step, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence sustained by full conviction, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self alone and should think of nothing else.
From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.
Thus the self-controlled yogī, constantly engaged in yoga practice, becomes free from all material contamination and achieves the highest stage of perfect happiness in transcendental loving service to the Lord.
For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.
Such a yogī, who engages in the worshipful service of the Supersoul, knowing that I and the Supersoul are one, remains always in Me in all circumstances.
He is a perfect yogī who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!
Arjuna said: O Madhusūdana, the system of yoga which You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.
The mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kṛṣṇa, and to subdue it, I think, is more difficult than controlling the wind.
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: O mighty-armed son of Kuntī, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by suitable practice and by detachment.
Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, what is the destination of the unsuccessful transcendentalist, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization with faith but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?
O mighty-armed Kṛṣṇa, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the path of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?
The unsuccessful yogī, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy.
On taking such a birth, he revives the divine consciousness of his previous life, and he again tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success, O son of Kuru.
And when the yogī engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, achieving perfection after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.
Knowledge of the Absolute
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Now hear, O son of Pṛthā, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.
Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.
Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego – all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.
Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.
O son of Kuntī, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable oṁ in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.
O son of Pṛthā, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.
Deluded by the three modes , the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.
O best among the Bhāratas, four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional service unto Me – the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.
O scion of Bharata, O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate.
Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.
Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be the governing principle of the material manifestation, of the demigods, and of all methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even at the time of death.
Attaining the Supreme
Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kuntī, that state he will attain without fail.
One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and, by the strength of yoga, with an undeviating mind, engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord in full devotion, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.
For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Pṛthā, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.
After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.
At the beginning of Brahmā’s day, all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state, and thereafter, when the night falls, they are merged into the unmanifest again.
Again and again, when Brahmā’s day arrives, all living entities come into being, and with the arrival of Brahmā’s night they are helplessly annihilated.
That which the Vedāntists describe as unmanifest and infallible, that which is known as the supreme destination, that place from which, having attained it, one never returns – that is My supreme abode.
O best of the Bhāratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, the yogī does or does not come back.
Those who know the Supreme Brahman attain that Supreme by passing away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment of the day, during the fortnight of the waxing moon, or during the six months when the sun travels in the north.
The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the fortnight of the waning moon, or the six months when the sun passes to the south reaches the moon planet but again comes back.
The Most Confidential Knowledge
Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me.
O son of Kuntī, at the end of the millennium all material manifestations enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I create them again.
Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.
Others, who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, as diverse in many, and in the universal form.
But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form – to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have.
Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way.
Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.
If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.
Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform – do that, O son of Kuntī, as an offering to Me.
Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination.
O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth – women, vaiśyas and śūdras – can attain the supreme destination.
The Opulence of the Absolute
Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or opulences, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and sages.
He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds – he only, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.
Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control of the senses, control of the mind, happiness and distress, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy – all these various qualities of living beings are created by Me alone.
The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus come from Me, born from My mind, and all the living beings populating the various planets descend from them.
One who is factually convinced of this opulence and mystic power of Mine engages in unalloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt.
To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.
To show them special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.
Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own internal potency, O Supreme Person, origin of all, Lord of all beings, God of gods, Lord of the universe!
Please tell me in detail of Your divine opulences by which You pervade all these worlds.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.
Of the Ādityas I am Viṣṇu, of lights I am the radiant sun, of the Maruts I am Marīci, and among the stars I am the moon.
Of the Vedas I am the Sāma Veda; of the demigods I am Indra, the king of heaven; of the senses I am the mind; and in living beings I am the living force .
Of all the Rudras I am Lord Śiva, of the Yakṣas and Rākṣasas I am the Lord of wealth , of the Vasus I am fire , and of mountains I am Meru.
Among the Daitya demons I am the devoted Prahlāda, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and among birds I am Garuḍa.
Of purifiers I am the wind, of the wielders of weapons I am Rāma, of fishes I am the shark, and of flowing rivers I am the Ganges.
Know that all opulent, beautiful and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.
The Universal Form
Arjuna said: By my hearing the instructions You have kindly given me about these most confidential spiritual subjects, my illusion has now been dispelled.
O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity and have realized Your inexhaustible glories.
If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that unlimited universal Self.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Pṛthā, see now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine and multicolored forms.
Sañjaya said: O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.
If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.
At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna bowed his head to offer obeisances and with folded hands began to pray to the Supreme Lord.
All the various manifestations of Lord Śiva, the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Sādhyas, the Viśvedevas, the two Aśvīs, the Maruts, the forefathers, the Gandharvas, the Yakṣas, the Asuras and the perfected demigods are beholding You in wonder.
As the many waves of the rivers flow into the ocean, so do all these great warriors enter blazing into Your mouths.
I see all people rushing full speed into Your mouths, as moths dash to destruction in a blazing fire.
O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charity, nor by pious activities, nor by severe penances can I be seen in this form in the material world.
Sañjaya said to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, having spoken thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form and at last showed His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.
When Arjuna thus saw Kṛṣṇa in His original form, he said: O Janārdana, seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, I am now composed in mind, and I am restored to my original nature.
My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being – he certainly comes to Me.
Devotional Service
Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.
But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and immovable – the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth – by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.
But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Pṛthā – for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.
If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.
If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.
One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me – such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.
He by whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me.
My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me.
One who neither rejoices nor grieves, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things – such a devotee is very dear to Me.
One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn’t care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service – such a person is very dear to Me.
Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal, are very, very dear to Me.
Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness
Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are.
The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten senses and the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions – all these are considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.
Humility; pridelessness; nonviolence; tolerance; simplicity; approaching a bona fide spiritual master; cleanliness; steadiness; self-control; renunciation of the objects of sense gratification; absence of false ego; the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; detachment; freedom from entanglement with children, wife, home and the rest; even-mindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me; aspiring to live in a solitary place; detachment from the general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization; and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth – all these I declare to be knowledge, and besides this whatever there may be is ignorance.
Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.
Some perceive the Supersoul within themselves through meditation, others through the cultivation of knowledge, and still others through working without fruitive desires.
O chief of the Bhāratas, know that whatever you see in existence, both the moving and the nonmoving, is only a combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field.
One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies, and who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul within the destructible body is ever destroyed, actually sees.
One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is created of material nature, and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees.
When a sensible man ceases to see different identities due to different material bodies and he sees how beings are expanded everywhere, he attains to the Brahman conception.
O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.
Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.
The Three Modes of Material Nature
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection.
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.
It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.
O son of Bharata, the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance, covering one’s knowledge, binds one to madness.
The manifestation of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge.
O chief of the Bhāratas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion the symptoms of great attachment, fruitive activity, intense endeavor, and uncontrollable desire and hankering develop.
When there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, O son of Kuru, darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested.
When one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages.
When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when one dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom.
From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness, madness and illusion.
Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.
When one properly sees that in all activities no other performer is at work than these modes of nature and he knows the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to all these modes, he attains My spiritual nature.
When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes associated with the material body, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O son of Pāṇḍu, he who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present or long for them when they disappear; who is unwavering and undisturbed through all these reactions of the material qualities, remaining neutral and transcendental, knowing that the modes alone are active; who is situated in the self and regards alike happiness and distress; who looks upon a lump of earth, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; who is equal toward the desirable and the undesirable; who is steady, situated equally well in praise and blame, honor and dishonor; who treats alike both friend and enemy; and who has renounced all material activities – such a person is said to have transcended the modes of nature.
One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.
The Yoga of the Supreme Person
Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, who understand the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the Supreme Person attain to that eternal kingdom.
I am the fire of digestion in the bodies of all living entities, and I join with the air of life, outgoing and incoming, to digest the four kinds of foodstuff.
Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Supreme Soul, the imperishable Lord Himself, who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them.
Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person.
The Divine and Demoniac Natures
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Fearlessness; purification of one’s existence; cultivation of spiritual knowledge; charity; self-control; performance of sacrifice; study of the Vedas; austerity; simplicity; nonviolence; truthfulness; freedom from anger; renunciation; tranquillity; aversion to faultfinding; compassion for all living entities; freedom from covetousness; gentleness; modesty; steady determination; vigor; forgiveness; fortitude; cleanliness; and freedom from envy and from the passion for honor – these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.
Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance – these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of Pṛthā.
Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.
Taking shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and false prestige, the demoniac, thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.
Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, they become too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and fall down into hell.
Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes proudly perform sacrifices in name only, without following any rules or regulations.
Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion.
Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.
The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kuntī, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.
He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.
The Divisions of Faith
Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.
Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride and egoism, who are impelled by lust and attachment, who are foolish and who torture the material elements of the body as well as the Supersoul dwelling within, are to be known as demons.
Food prepared more than three hours before being eaten, food that is tasteless, decomposed and putrid, and food consisting of remnants and untouchable things is dear to those in the mode of darkness.
Of sacrifices, the sacrifice performed according to the directions of scripture, as a matter of duty, by those who desire no reward, is of the nature of goodness.
But the sacrifice performed for some material benefit, or for the sake of pride, O chief of the Bhāratas, you should know to be in the mode of passion.
Any sacrifice performed without regard for the directions of scripture, without distribution of prasādam , without chanting of Vedic hymns and remunerations to the priests, and without faith is considered to be in the mode of ignorance.
Austerity of the body consists in worship of the Supreme Lord, the brāhmaṇas, the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother, and in cleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence.
Austerity of speech consists in speaking words that are truthful, pleasing, beneficial, and not agitating to others, and also in regularly reciting Vedic literature.
And satisfaction, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purification of one’s existence are the austerities of the mind.
This threefold austerity, performed with transcendental faith by men not expecting material benefits but engaged only for the sake of the Supreme, is called austerity in goodness.
Penance performed out of foolishness, with self-torture or to destroy or injure others, is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
Charity given out of duty, without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person is considered to be in the mode of goodness.
But charity performed with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruitive results, or in a grudging mood is said to be charity in the mode of passion.
And charity performed at an impure place, at an improper time, to unworthy persons, or without proper attention and respect is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
Therefore, transcendentalists undertaking performances of sacrifice, charity and penance in accordance with scriptural regulations begin always with oṁ, to attain the Supreme.
Conclusion – The Perfection of Renunciation
Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of renunciation and of the renounced order of life , O killer of the Keśī demon, master of the senses.
Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up as faulty, yet other sages maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance should never be abandoned.
O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.
The intelligent renouncer situated in the mode of goodness, neither hateful of inauspicious work nor attached to auspicious work, has no doubts about work.
The place of action , the performer, the various senses, the many different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul – these are the five factors of action.
Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused by these five factors.
Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.
Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are the three factors that motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer are the three constituents of action.
That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities, though they are divided into innumerable forms, you should understand to be in the mode of goodness.
That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion.
And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in the mode of darkness.
That action which is regulated and which is performed without attachment, without love or hatred, and without desire for fruitive results is said to be in the mode of goodness.
But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires, and enacted from a sense of false ego, is called action in the mode of passion.
That action performed in illusion, in disregard of scriptural injunctions, and without concern for future bondage or for violence or distress caused to others is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
One who performs his duty without association with the modes of material nature, without false ego, with great determination and enthusiasm, and without wavering in success or failure is said to be a worker in the mode of goodness.
The worker who is attached to work and the fruits of work, desiring to enjoy those fruits, and who is greedy, always envious, impure, and moved by joy and sorrow, is said to be in the mode of passion.
The worker who is always engaged in work against the injunctions of the scripture, who is materialistic, obstinate, cheating and expert in insulting others, and who is lazy, always morose and procrastinating is said to be a worker in the mode of ignorance.
O winner of wealth, now please listen as I tell you in detail of the different kinds of understanding and determination, according to the three modes of material nature.
O son of Pṛthā, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, is in the mode of goodness.
O son of Pṛthā, that understanding which cannot distinguish between religion and irreligion, between action that should be done and action that should not be done, is in the mode of passion.
That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong direction, O Pārtha, is in the mode of ignorance.
O son of Pṛthā, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness.
But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna.
And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness, lamentation, moroseness and illusion – such unintelligent determination, O son of Pṛthā, is in the mode of darkness.
O best of the Bhāratas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress.
That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.
That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion.
And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance.
There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.
Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy.
Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness – these are the natural qualities by which the brāhmaṇas work.
Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership are the natural qualities of work for the kṣatriyas.
Farming, cow protection and business are the natural work for the vaiśyas, and for the śūdras there are labor and service to others.
By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.
One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain, by practice of renunciation, the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction.
O son of Kuntī, learn from Me how one who has achieved this perfection can attain to the supreme perfectional stage, Brahman, the stage of highest knowledge, by acting in the way I shall now summarize.
Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful – such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.
Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.
The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.
This confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.
For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.
There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.
And I declare that he who studies this sacred conversation of ours worships Me by his intelligence.
And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell.
By the mercy of Vyāsa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, Kṛṣṇa, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.
O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.
O King, as I remember the wonderful form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, I am struck with wonder more and more, and I rejoice again and again.
It is a paradox that humans, alone of all creatures of the Earth, must repress the fear of death in order to lead normal lives.
Yet our biological instinct never lets us forget this ultimate danger to our being.
As we grow older, the specter of death rises in our consciousness.
Even religious people fear death is the end of personhood.
Our greatest dread of death brings thoughts about the nothingness of death which will end all associations with family and friends.
Dying makes all our earthly goals seem futile.
If death were the end of everything about us, then life indeed would be meaningless.
However, some power within us enables humans to conceive of a hereafter and to sense a connection to a higher power and even an eternal soul.
The true answers to the mystery of life after death remain locked behind a spiritual door for most people.
This is because we have built-in amnesia about our soul identity which, on a conscious level, aids in the merging of the soul and human brain.
But none of these accounts written in the many books on reincarnation has ever given us anything more than a glimpse of all there is to know about life after death.
This book is an intimate journal about the spirit world.
You will be taken beyond the spiritual tunnel and enter the spirit world itself to learn what transpires for souls before they finally return to Earth in another life.
I am a skeptic by nature, although it will not seem so from the contents of this book.
As a counselor and hypnotherapist, I specialize in behavior modification for the treatment of psychological disorders.
Together we elicit the meaning, function, and consequences of their beliefs because I take the premise that no mental problem is imaginary.
While I used hypnosis and age-regression techniques to determine the origins of disturbing memories and childhood trauma, I felt any attempt to reach a former life was unorthodox and non-clinical.
My interest in reincarnation and metaphysics was only intellectual curiosity until I worked with a young man on pain management.
This client complained of a lifetime of chronic pain on his right side.
One of the tools of hypnotherapy to manage pain is directing the subject to make the pain worse so he or she can also learn to lessen the aching and thus acquire control.
In one of our sessions involving pain intensification, this man used the imagery of being stabbed to recreate his torment.
Searching for the origins of this image, I eventually uncovered his former life as a World War I soldier who was killed by a bayonet in France, and we were able to eliminate the pain altogether.
With encouragement from my clients, I began to experiment with moving some of them further back in time before their last birth on Earth.
Initially I was concerned that a subject’s integration of current needs, beliefs, and fears would create fantasies of recollection.
However, it didn’t take long before I realized our deep-seated memories offer a set of past experiences which are too real and connected to be ignored.
I found it was possible to see into the spirit world through the mind’s eye of a hypnotized subject who could report back to me of life between lives on Earth.
The case that opened the door to the spirit world for me was a middle-aged woman who was an especially receptive hypnosis subject.
She had been talking to me about her feelings of loneliness and isolation in that delicate stage when a subject has finished recalling their most recent past life.
This unusual individual slipped into the highest state of altered consciousness almost by herself.
Without realizing I had initiated an overly short command for this action, I suggested she go to the source of her loss of companionship.
At the same moment I inadvertently used one of the trigger words to spiritual recall.
I also asked if she had a specific group of friends whom she missed.
Suddenly, my client started to cry.
When I directed her to tell me what was wrong, she blurted out, “I miss some friends in my group and that’s why I get so lonely on Earth.”
I was confused and questioned her further about where this group of friends was actually located.
“Here, in my permanent home,” she answered simply, “and I’m looking at all of them right now!”
After finishing with this client and reviewing her tape recordings, I recognized that finding the spirit world involved an extension of past life regression.
There are many books about past lives, but none I could find which told about our life as souls, or how to properly access the spiritual recollections of people.
I decided to do the research myself and with practice I acquired greater skill in entering the spirit world through my subjects.
I also learned that finding their place in the spirit world was far more meaningful to people than recounting their former lives on Earth.
How is it possible to reach the soul through hypnosis?
Visualize the mind as having three concentric circles, each smaller than the last and within the other, separated only by layers of connected mind-consciousness.
The first outer layer is represented by the conscious mind which is our critical, analytic reasoning source.
The second layer is the subconscious, where we initially go in hypnosis to tap into the storage area for all the memories that ever happened to us in this life and former lives.
The third, the innermost core, is what we are now calling the superconscious mind.
This level exposes the highest center of Self where we are an expression of a higher power.
The superconscious houses our real identity, augmented by the subconscious which contains the memories of the many alter-egos assumed by us in our former human bodies.
The superconscious may not be a level at all, but the soul itself.
The superconscious mind represents our highest center of wisdom and perspective, and all my information about life after death comes from this source of intelligent energy.
We don’t dream in chronological sequences nor hallucinate in a directed trance state.
When subjects are placed in trance, their brain waves slow from the Beta wake state and continue to change vibration down past the meditative Alpha stage into various levels within the Theta range.
Theta is hypnosis—not sleep.
When we sleep we go to the final Delta state where messages from the brain are dropped into the subconscious and vented through our dreams.
In Theta, however, the conscious mind is not unconscious, so we are able to receive as well as send messages with all memory channels open.
Once in hypnosis, people report the pictures they see and dialogue they hear in their unconscious minds as literal observations.
In response to questions, subjects cannot lie, but they may misinterpret something seen in their unconscious mind, just as we do in the conscious state.
In hypnosis, people have trouble relating to anything they don’t believe is the truth.
I find this generalization to be a false premise.
In my work, I treat each case as if I were hearing the information for the first time.
If a subject were somehow able to overcome hypnosis procedure and construct a deliberate fantasy about the spirit world, or free-associate from pre-set ideas about their afterlife, these responses would soon become inconsistent with my other case reports.
I learned the value of careful cross-examination early in my work and I found no evidence of anyone faking their spiritual experiences to please me.
In fact, subjects in hypnosis are not hesitant in correcting my misinterpretations of their statements.
As my case files grew, I discovered by trial and error to phrase questions about the spirit world in a proper sequence.
One must have the right set of keys for specific doors.
As I gained confidence with each session, more people sensed I was comfortable with the hereafter and felt it was all right to speak to me about it.
Most fall somewhere in between, with a mixed bag of personal philosophies about life.
The astounding thing I found as I progressed with my research was that once subjects were regressed back into their soul state they all displayed a remarkable consistency in responding to questions about the spirit world.
People even use the same words and graphic descriptions in colloquial language when discussing their lives as souls.
However, this homogeneity of experience by so many clients did not stop me from continually trying to verify statements between my subjects and corroborate specific functional activities of souls.
The research was painfully slow, but as the body of my cases grew I finally had a working model of the eternal world where our souls live.
I found thoughts about the spirit world involve universal truths among the souls of people living on Earth.
It was these perceptions by so many different types of people which convinced me their statements were believable.
I am not a religious person, but I found the place where we go after death to be one of order and direction, and I have come to appreciate that there is a grand design to life and afterlife.
When I considered how to best present my findings, I determined the case study method would provide the most descriptive way in which the reader could evaluate client recall about the afterlife.
Each case I have selected represents a direct dialogue between myself and a subject.
The case testimonies are taken from tape recordings from my sessions.
This book is not intended to be about my subjects’ past lives, but rather a documentation of their experiences in the spirit world relating to those lives.
Each case history is abbreviated to some extent because of space constraints and to give the reader an orderly arrangement of soul activity.
The travels of souls from the time of death to their next incarnation has come to me from over thirty years of life between lives hypnotherapy.
The travels of souls from the time of death to their next incarnation has engaged my study since the 1970s, growing with each decade.
However, most of the LBL cases in this book were collected within the past ten years.
Yet, for some reason, no one subject was able to recall the entire chronology of soul activities I have presented in this book.
My clients remember certain aspects of their spiritual life quite vividly, while other experiences are hazy to them.
As a result, even with these twenty-nine cases, I found I could not give the reader the full range of information I have gathered about the spirit world.
The reader may consider my questioning in certain cases to be rather demanding.
In hypnosis, it is necessary to keep the subject on track.
When working in the spiritual realm, the demands on a facilitator are higher than with past life recall.
In trance, the average subject tends to let his or her soul-mind wander while watching interesting scenes unfold.
My clients often want me to stop talking so they can detach from reporting what they see and just enjoy their past experiences as souls.
I try to be gentle and not overly structured, but my sessions are usually single ones which run three hours in length and there is a lot to cover.
People may come long distances to see me and not be able to return.
I find it very rewarding to watch the look of wonder on a client’s face when his or her session ends.
For those of us who have had the opportunity to actually see our immortality, a new depth of self-understanding and empowerment emerges.
Before awakening my subjects, I often implant appropriate post-suggestion memories.
Having a conscious knowledge of their soul life in the spirit world and a history of physical existences on planets gives these people a stronger sense of direction and energy for life.
Finally, I should say that what you are about to read may come as a shock to your preconceptions about death.
The material presented here may go against your philosophical and religious beliefs.
There will be those readers who will find support for their existing opinions.
For others, the information offered in these cases will all appear to be subjective tales resembling a science fiction story.
Whatever your persuasion, I hope you will reflect upon the implications for humanity if what my subjects have to say about life after death is accurate.
Everyone around me thinks I’m dead, but I’m not.
I’m alive!
THESE are the words spoken by a man in deep hypnosis, reliving a death experience.
His words come in short, excited bursts and are full of awe, as he sees and feels what it is like to be a spirit newly separated from a physical body.
This man is my client and I have just assisted him in recreating a past life death scene while he lies back in a comfortable recliner chair.
A little earlier, following my instructions during his trance induction, this subject was age-regressed in a return to childhood memories.
His subconscious perceptions gradually coalesced as we worked together to reach his mother’s womb.
I then prepared him for a jump back into the mists of time by the visual use of protective shielding.
When we completed this important step of mental conditioning, I moved my subject through an imaginary time tunnel to his last life on Earth.
It was a short life because he had died suddenly from the influenza epidemic of 1918.
As the initial shock of seeing himself die and feeling his soul floating out of his body begins to wear off a little, my client adjusts more readily to the visual images in his mind.
It takes a bit longer than usual since this subject is a younger soul and not so used to the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth as are many of my other clients.
Yet, within a few moments he settles in and begins to respond with greater confidence to my questions.
I quickly raise this subject’s subconscious hypnotic level into the superconscious state.
Now he is ready to talk to me about the spirit world, and I ask what is happening to him.
Well … I’m rising up higher … still floating … looking back at my body.
My wife is sobbing .
I’m trying to reach into her mind … to tell her everything is all right with me.
She is so overcome by grief I’m not getting through.
I want her to know my suffering is gone … I’m free of my body … I don’t need it any more … that I will wait for her.
I want her to know that … but she is … not listening to me.
Oh, I’m moving away now …
And so, guided by a series of commands, my client starts the process of moving further into the spirit world.
It is a road many others have traveled in the security of my office.
Typically, as memories in the superconscious state expand, subjects in hypnosis become more connected to the spiritual passageway.
As the session moves forward, the subject’s mental pictures are more easily translated into words.
Short descriptive phrases lead to detailed explanations of what it is like to enter the spirit world.
We have a great deal of documentation, including observations from medical personnel, which describes the out-of-body near-death experiences of people severely injured in accidents.
These people were considered clinically dead before medical efforts brought them back from the other side.
People tell of hovering over their bodies, especially in hospitals, watching doctors perform life-saving procedures on them.
In time these memories fade after they return to life.
In the early stages of hypnosis regression into past lives, the descriptions of subjects mentally going through their past deaths do not contradict the reported statements of people who have actually died in this life for a few minutes.
The difference between these two groups of people is that subjects in hypnosis are not remembering their experiences of temporary death.
People in a deep trance state are capable of describing what life is like after permanent physical death.
Both kinds of reporters say they are frustrated in their attempts to talk to living people who don’t respond.
Both state they feel a pulling sensation away from the place where they died and experience relaxation and curiosity rather than fear.
All these people report a euphoric sense of freedom and brightness around them.
Some of my subjects see brilliant whiteness totally surrounding them at the moment of death, while others observe the brightness is farther away from an area of darker space through which they are being pulled.
This is often referred to as the tunnel effect, and has become well known with the public.
My second case will take us further into the death experience than Case 1.
The subject here is a man in his sixties describing to me the events of his death as a young woman called Sally, who was killed by Kiowa Indians in an attack on a wagon train in 1866.
I find no significant differences between ancient and modern times in terms of graphic spirit world recall, or the quality of lessons learned.
I should also say the average subject in trance has an uncanny ability to zero in on the dates and geographic locations of many past lives.
This is true even in earlier periods of human civilization, when national borders and place names were different than exist today.
Former names, dates, and locations may not always be easily recalled in every past life, but descriptions about returning to the spirit world and life in that world are consistently vivid.
In all past life recall, I use the time around death for quiet review and place the subject in observer status to soften pain and emotion.
Are you in great pain from the arrow?
Like … a force … of some kind … pushing me up out of my body.
I’m ejected out the top of my head.
And what was pushed out?
Like a … pinpoint of light … radiating …
How do you radiate light?
And does this energy light stay the same after leaving your body?
I seem to grow a little … as I move around.
If your light expands, then what do you look like now?
A … wispy … string … hanging …
And what does the process of moving out of your body actually feel like to you?
Is the feeling unpleasant?
It’s strange … it’s as if I’m suspended in air that isn’t air … there are no limits … no gravity … I’m weightless.
You mean it’s sort of like being in a vacuum for you?
Yes … nothing around me is a solid mass.
There are no obstacles to bump into … I’m drifting …
Yes … I can do some of that … but there is … a pulling … into a bright whiteness … it’s so bright!
Is the intensity of whiteness the same everywhere?
A … kind of magnetic … force … but … I want to stay a little longer …
Can your soul resist this pulling sensation for as long as you want?
Sally, what is your husband doing right after the attack?
And what are you doing at this moment?
Are your messages getting through?
And what is going on now with your soul?
I’m still resisting the pulling sensation … I want to stay.
Why is that?
Well, I know I’m dead … but I’m not ready to leave Will yet and … I want to watch them bury me.
Do you see or feel any other spiritual entity around you at this moment?
They are near … soon I will see them … I feel their love as I want Will to feel mine … they are waiting until I’m ready.
As time passes, are you able to comfort Will?
I’m trying to reach inside his mind.
And are you show tired souls can beuccessful?
I … think a little … he feels me … he realizes … love…
Contrary to what some people believe, souls often have little interest in what happens to their bodies once they are physically dead.
This is not callousness over personal situations and the people they leave behind on Earth, but an acknowledgement of these souls to the finality of mortal death.
They have a desire to hurry on their way to the beauty of the spirit world.
However, many other souls want to hover around the place where they died for a few Earth days, usually until after their funerals.
Time is apparently accelerated for souls and days on Earth may be only minutes to them.
There are a variety of motivations for the lingering soul.
For instance, someone who has been murdered or killed unexpectedly in an accident often does not want to leave right away.
I find these souls are frequently bewildered or angry.
There is also something symbolic about the normal three- to five-day funeral arrangement periods for souls.
Souls really have no morbid curiosity to see themselves buried because emotions in the spirit world are not the same as we experience here on Earth.
Yet, I find soul entities appreciate the respect given to the memory of their physical life by surviving relatives and friends.
As we saw in the last case, there is one basic reason for many spirits not wanting to immediately leave the place of their physical death.
This comes from a desire to mentally reach out to comfort loved ones before progressing further into the spirit world.
Those who have just died are not devastated about their death, because they know those left on Earth will see them again in the spirit world and probably later in other lives as well.
On the other hand, mourners at a funeral generally feel they have lost a loved one forever.
During hypnosis, my subjects do recall frustration at being unable to effectively use their energy to mentally touch a human being who is unreceptive due to shock and grief.
Emotional trauma of the living may overwhelm their inner minds to such an extent that their mental capabilities to communicate with souls are inhibited.
I had a typical example of spiritual consolation in my own life.
My mother died suddenly from a heart attack.
During her burial service, my sister and I were so filled with sadness our minds were numb at the ceremony.
A few hours later we returned to my mother’s empty house with our spouses and decided to take a needed rest.
My sister and I must have reached the receptive Alpha state at about the same time.
Appearing in two separate rooms, my mother came through our subconscious minds as a dream-like brush of whiteness above our heads.
Reaching out, she smiled, indicating her acceptance of death and current well-being.
Then she floated away.
Lasting only seconds, this act was a meaningful form of closure, causing both of us to release into a sound sleep of the Delta state.
We are capable of feeling the comforting presence of the souls of lost loved ones, especially during or right after funerals.
For spiritual communication to come through the shock of mourning it is necessary to try to relax and clear your mind, at least for short periods.
At these moments our receptivity to a paranormal experience is more open to receive positive communications of love, forgiveness, hope, encouragement, and the reassurance your loved one is in a good place.
My clients tell me as souls they are able to help those on Earth connect their inner minds to the spirit world itself.
As it has been wisely said, people are not really gone as long as they are remembered by those left on Earth.
Death does not break our continuity with the immortal soul of those we love simply because they have lost the physical personhood of a mortal body.
Occasionally, a disturbed spirit does not want to leave the Earth after physical death.
This is due to some unresolved problem which has had a severe impact on its consciousness.
In these abnormal cases, help is available from higher, caring entities who can assist in the adjustment process from the other side.
We also have the means to aid disturbed spirits in letting go on Earth, as well.
If we have had a long illness leading to death, there is time to adequately prepare the mind once initial shock, denial, and depression have passed.
The mind takes a short cut through this sort of progression when we face death suddenly.
As the end of our physical life draws near, each of us has the capacity to fuse with our higher consciousness.
Dying is the easiest period in our lives for spiritual awareness, when we can sense our soul is connected to the eternity of time.
Although there are dying people who find acceptance to be more difficult than resignation, caregivers working around the dying say most everyone acquires a peaceful detachment near the end.
I believe dying people are given access to a supreme knowledge of eternal consciousness and this frequently shows in their faces.
Many of these people realize something universal is out there waiting and it will be good.
Dying people are undergoing a metamorphosis of separation by their souls from an adopted body.
People associate death as losing our life force, when actually the opposite is true.
We forfeit our body in death, but our eternal life energy unites with the force of a divine oversoul.
Death is not darkness, but light.
My clients say after recalling former death experiences they are so filled with rediscovered freedom from their earthbound bodies that they are anxious to get started on their spiritual journey to a place of peace and familiarity.
In the cases which follow, we will learn what life is like for them in afterlife.
FOR thousands of years the people of Mesopotamia believed the gates into and out of heaven lay at opposite ends of the great curve of the Milky Way, called the River of Souls.
After death, souls had to wait for the rising doorway of Sagittarius and the autumn equinox, when day and night are equal.
Reincarnation back to Earth could only take place during the spring equinox through the Gemini exit in their night sky.
My subjects tell me that soul migration is actually much easier.
The tunnel effect they experience when leaving Earth is the portal into the spirit world.
Although souls leave their bodies swiftly, it seems to me entry into the spirit world is a carefully measured process.
Later, when we return to Earth in another life, the route back is described as being more rapid.
The location of the tunnel in relation to the Earth has some variations between the accounts of my subjects.
Some newly dead people see it opening up next to them right over their bodies, while others say they move high above the Earth before they enter the tunnel.
In all cases, however, the time lapse in reaching this passageway is negligible once the soul leaves Earth.
Here are the observations of another individual in this spiritual location.
At first … it was very bright … close to the Earth … now it’s a little darker because I have gone into a tunnel.
Describe this tunnel for me.
It’s a … hollow, dim vent … and there is a small circle of light at the other end.
Okay, what happens to you next?
I’m being summoned forward …
Let the circle of light expand in front of you at the end of the tunnel and continue to explain what is happening to you.
As you leave the tunnel, what else stands out in your mind besides the lack of absolute visual clarity?
It’s so … still … it is such a quiet place to be in … I am in the place of spirits …
Do you have any other impressions at this moment as a soul?
Do you have a sense of security, or are you a little scared?
Do you see any evidence of this around you?
No, I sense it—a harmony of thought everywhere.
No—not that—but I seem to be floating through cloud stuff which is different from Earth.
Maybe it is, but I haven’t seen it since I went in the tunnel.
Do you sense you are still connected to Earth through another dimension, perhaps?
What else can you tell me about your present location?
It’s still a little … murky … but I’m moving out of this.
After some initial uncertainty, her first reported impressions reflect an inviting sense of well-being.
This is a common feeling among my subjects.
Once through the tunnel, our souls have passed the initial gateway of their journey into the spirit world.
Most now fully realize they are not really dead, but have simply left the encumbrance of an Earth body which has died.
With this awareness comes acceptance in varying degrees depending upon the soul.
Some subjects look at these surroundings with continued amazement while others are more matter-of-fact in reporting to me what they see.
Much depends upon their respective maturity and recent life experiences.
The most common type of reaction I hear is a relieved sigh followed by something on the order of, “Oh, wonderful, I’m home in this beautiful place again.
There are those highly developed souls who move so fast out of their bodies that much of what I am describing here is a blur as they home into their spiritual destinations.
These are the pros and, in my opinion, they are a distinct minority on Earth.
The average soul does not move that rapidly and some are very hesitant.
If we exclude the rare cases of highly disturbed spirits who fight to stay connected with their dead bodies, I find it is the younger souls with fewer past lives who remain attached to Earth’s environment right after death.
Most of my subjects report that as they emerge from the mouth of the tunnel, things are still unclear for awhile.
I think this is due to the density of the nearest astral plane surrounding Earth, called the kamaloka by Theosophists.
The next case describes this area from the perspective of a more analytical client.
The soul of this individual demonstrates considerable observational insight into form, colors, and vibrational levels.
Normally, such graphic physical descriptions by my subjects occur deeper into the spirit world after they get used to their surroundings.
As you move further away from the tunnel, describe what you see around you in as much detail as possible.
Things are … layered.
Layered in what way?
Umm, sort of like … a cake.
Using a cake as a model, explain what you mean?
Do you see the spirit world here as made up of a solid structure?
Why do you think this is so?
From your position of observation, can you tell me about the different colors of the layers?
As you float through these spiritual layers, is your soul moving up or down?
Well, then, do you see the spirit world at this moment in linear dimensions of lines and angles as you move across?
In what way?
I’m hearing sounds.
What sounds?
An … echo … of music … musical tingling … wind chimes … vibrating with my movements … so relaxing.
Yes, that’s what this is … and I have a memory of scent and taste, too.
Does this mean our physical senses stay with us after death?
Yes, the memory of them … the waves of musical notes here are so beautiful … bells … strings … such tranquility.
Many spirit world travelers report back to me about the relaxing sensations of musical vibrations.
Noise sensations start quite early after death.
Some subjects tell me they hear humming or buzzing sounds right after leaving their physical bodies.
This is similar to the noise one hears standing near telephone wires and may vary in volume before souls pull away from what I believe to be the Earth’s astral plane.
People have said they hear these same sounds when under general anesthesia.
These flat, ringing sounds become more musical when we leave the tunnel.
This music has been appropriately called energy of the universe because it revitalizes the soul.
With subjects who speak about spiritual layering, I mention the possibility that they could be seeing astral planes.
In metaphysical writing, we read a lot about planes above the Earth.
Beginning with ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas, followed by later Eastern texts, astral planes have historically represented a series of rising dimensions above the physical or tangible world, which blend into the spiritual.
These invisible regions have been experienced by people over thousands of years through meditative, out-of-body observations of the mind.
Astral planes also have been described as being less dense as one moves farther away from the heavy influences of Earth.
Can you see clearly yet as you travel beyond the tunnel?
I’m still passing through these … foamy clouds around me.
I want you to move all the way through this and tell me what you see now.
Tell me more.
It’s enormous … it looks like bright, sparkling crystal … colored stones shining all around me.
When you say crystalline, I think of a clear color.
Well, there are mostly grays and white … but as I float along I do see other colors … mosaics … all glittery.
Look into the distance from within this ice palace—do you see any boundaries anywhere?
No, this space is infinite … so majestic … and peaceful.
What are you feeling right now?
I … can’t fully enjoy it … I don’t want to go further … Maggie …
I can see you are still disturbed about the Chicago life, but does this inhibit your progress into the spirit world?
Tell me what transpires between you and your guide.
I say to her I can’t go on … that I need to know Maggie and the children are going to be okay.
And how does your guide respond?
She is comforting me—but I’m too loaded down.
What do you say to her?
What does your guide do?
Do you accept what she says?
In my mind … information comes to me … of the future on Earth … that the family is getting on without me … accepting that I am gone … they are going to make it … and we will all see each other again.
And how does this make you feel?
I feel … peace … … I am ready to go on now.
Before touching on the significance of Case 5 meeting his guide here, I want to mention this man’s interpretation of the spirit world appearing as an ice palace.
Further into the spirit world, my subjects will talk about seeing buildings and being in furnished rooms.
The state of hypnosis by itself does not create these images.
These sights have individual meaning for every soul communicating with me, all of whom are affected by their Earth experiences.
When the soul sees images in the spirit world which relate to places they have lived or visited on Earth, there is a reason.
An unforgotten home, school, garden, mountain, or seashore are seen by souls because a benevolent spiritual force allows for terrestrial mirages to comfort us by their familiarity.
Our planetary memories never die—they whisper forever into the soul-mind on the winds of mythical dreams just as images of the spirit world do so within the human mind.
I enjoy hearing from subjects about their first images of the spirit world.
People may see fields of wildflowers, castle towers rising in the distance, or rainbows under an open sky when returning to this place of adoration after an absence.
These first ethereal Earth scenes of the spirit world don’t seem to change a great deal over a span of lives for the returning soul, although there is variety between client descriptions.
I find that once a subject in trance continues further into the spirit world to describe the functional aspects of spiritual life, their comments become more uniform.
The case I have just reviewed could be described as a fairly unsettled spirit bonded closely to his soulmate, Maggie, who was left behind.
There is no question that some souls do carry the negative baggage of a difficult past life longer than others, despite the calming influences of the spirit world.
People tend to think all souls become omniscient at death.
This is not completely true because adjustment periods vary.
The time of soul adjustment depends upon the circumstances of death, attachments of each soul to the memories of the life just ended, and level of advancement.
I frequently hear anger during age-regression when a young life ends suddenly.
Souls reentering the spirit world under these conditions are often bewildered and confused over leaving people they love without much warning.
They are unprepared for death and some feel sad and deprived right after leaving their bodies.
If a soul has been traumatized by unfinished business, usually the first entity it sees right after death is its guide.
These highly developed spiritual teachers are prepared to take the initial brunt of a soul’s frustration following an untimely death.
Case 5 will eventually make a healthy adjustment to the spirit world by allowing his guide to assist him during the balance of his incoming trip.
However, I have found our guides do not encourage the complete working out of thought disorders at the spiritual gateway.
There are more appropriate times and places for detailed reviews about karmic learning lessons involving life and death, which I will describe later.
The guide in Case 5 offered a brief visualization of accelerated Earth time as a means of soothing this man about the future of his wife and children so he could continue on his journey with more acceptance.
Regardless of their state of mind right after death, my subjects are full of exclamations about rediscovered marvels of the spirit world.
Usually, this feeling is combined with euphoria that all their worldly cares have been left behind, especially physical pain.
Above all else, the spirit world represents a place of supreme quiescence to the traveling soul.
Although it may at first appear we are alone immediately following death, we are not isolated or unaided.
Unseen intelligent energy forces guide each of us through the gate.
New arrivals in the spirit world have little time to float around wondering where they are or what is going to happen to them next.
Our guides and a number of soulmates and friends wait for us close to the gateway to provide recognition, affection, and the assurance we are all right.
Actually, we feel their presence from the moment of death because much of our initial readjustment depends upon the influence of these kindly entities toward our returning soul.
A soul may appear as a mass of energy, but apparently it is also possible for non-organic soul energy to display human characteristics.
Souls often use their capacity to project former life forms when communicating with each other.
Projecting a human life form is only one of an incalculable number of appearances which can be assumed by souls from their basic energy substance.
Most of my subjects report the first person they see in the spirit world is their personal guide.
However, after any life we can be met by a soulmate.
Guides and soulmates are not the same.
If a former relative or close friend appears to the incoming soul, their regular guide might be absent from the scene.
I find that usually guides are somewhere in close proximity, monitoring the incomer’s arrival in their own way.
The soul in my next case has just come through the spiritual gateway and is met by an advanced entity who obviously has had close connections with the subject over a prolonged series of past lives.
Although this soulmate entity is not my client’s primary guide, he is there to welcome and provide loving encouragement for her.
What do you see around you?
It’s as if … I’m drifting along on … pure white sand … which is shifting around me … and I’m under a giant beach umbrella—with brightly colored panels—all vaporized, but banded together, too …
Is anyone here to meet you?
I … thought I was alone … but … in the distance … uh … light … moving fast towards me … oh, my gosh!
What is it?
Uncle Charlie, I’ve missed you so much.
Sure, sure— just as I remember him—jolly, kind, lovable—he is next to me.
What is so funny?
Uncle Charlie is just as fat as he used to be.
And what does he do next?
He is smiling and holding out his hand to me …
Does this mean he has a body of some sort with hands?
Why is he holding out his hand to you in a materialized way?
To … comfort me … to lead me … further into the light.
And what do you do?
I’m going with him and we are thinking about the good times we spent together playing in the hay on the farm.
And he is letting you see all this in your mind so you will know who he is?
Then, right after death, no matter how many deaths we may have experienced in other lives, it is possible to be a little fearful until we get used to the spirit world again?
He is taking me to the … place I should go …
There … are … other people around … and they look … friendly … as I approach … they seem to want me to join them …
What’s happening now?
Yes … he stays in a … different place than I do … he just came to meet me … to bring me here.
Now that you have had the chance to adjust to your surroundings in the spirit world, tell me what effect this place has on you.
As you continue to float along, what is your next major impression as you pass the spiritual gateway?
Familiarity.
What is familiar?
Uh mm … people … friends … are here, I think.
Do you see these people as familiar people on Earth?
I … have a sensation of their presence … people I knew …
Lights … soft … kind of cloudy-like.
As you are moving, does this light continue to look the same?
No, they are growing … blobs of energy … and I know they are people!
Are you moving toward them, or are they coming toward you?
We are drifting toward each other, but I am going slower than they are because … I’m uncertain what to do …
Just relax and continue floating while reporting back to me everything you see.
Do you see any sort of features to these shapes?
You see just eyes?
Does each entity have two eyes?
Do these eyes have the appearance of human eyes with an iris and pupil?
No … different … they are … larger … black orbs … radiating light … towards me … thought … oh!
I’m starting to recognize them—they are sending images into my mind—thoughts about themselves and … the shapes are changing … into people!
People with physical human features?
What do you see?
I think it’s … yes—it’s Larry—he is in front of everybody else—he is the first one I really see … Larry, Larry!
The soul entity of Larry is in front of an assortment of people you know?
Yes, now I know the ones I want most to see are in front … some of my other friends are in the back.
Can you see them all clearly?
Larry is the husband from your last life you told me about earlier?
This subject is so excited her past lives are tumbling one on top of the other.
Larry, Gunther, and Jean were all former husbands, but the same soulmate.
I was glad we had a chance to review earlier who these people were in sessions before this interval of recall in the spirit world.
Besides Larry, her recent American husband, Jean was a French sailor in the nineteenth century and Gunther was the son of German aristocrats living in the eighteenth century.
What are the two of you doing right now?
Embracing.
They would see … two masses of bright light whirling around each other, I guess …
And what does this signify?
We are hugging … expressing love … connecting … it makes us happy …
After you meet your soulmate, what happens next?
And this happens after your husband comes near you?
All right …
Oh, please don’t ask me any questions now—I want to enjoy this …
Now, I know you are enjoying this meeting, but I need you to help me know what is going on.
We … we are just holding each other … it’s so good to be with her again …
How do you manage to hold each other with no bodies?
We envelop each other in light, of course.
Tell me what that is like for spirits?
Like being wrapped in a bright-light blanket of love.
I see, then ….
And with some, you have lived many lives, while with others perhaps only one or two?
Yes … I have been with my husband the most.
Do you see your guide around anywhere?
He knows some of my friends, too …
Why do you call your guide a “him?”
And does he watch over you in all your lives?
Sure, and after death too … here, and he is always my protector.
Our reception committee is planned in advance for us as we enter the spirit world.
This case demonstrates how uplifting familiar faces can be to the incoming younger soul.
Although the meeting format varies, depending on a soul’s special needs, I have learned there is nothing haphazard about our spiritual associates knowing exactly when we are due and where to meet us upon our arrival in the spirit world.
Frequently, an entity who is significant to us will be waiting a little in front of the others who want to be on hand as we come through the gateway.
Cases 6 and 7 both represent one of the three ways newly arrived souls are received back into the spirit world.
These two souls were met shortly after death by a principal entity, followed by others of decreasing influence.
Case 7 recognized people more quickly than Case 6.
When we meet such spirits in a gathering right after our death, we find they have been spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, and dear friends in our past lives.
I have witnessed some gut-wrenching emotional scenes with my clients at this stage of their passage.
The emotional meetings which take place between souls at this interval in a spiritual passage are only a prelude to our eventual placement within a specific group of entities at our own maturity level.
These meetings provide another emotional high for a subject in superconscious recall.
This is because all the people who are close to us in our lives are not on the same developmental level.
For instance, in Case 6, Uncle Charlie was clearly a more advanced soul than my subject and may even have been serving in the capacity of a spiritual guide.
It was evident to me that one of the primary tasks of Uncle Charlie’s soul was to help Case 6 as a child in the life just ended, and his responsibility continued right after my subject’s death.
With Case 7, the important first contact was Larry, a true soulmate on the same level as this subject.
Notice also in Case 7, that my subject’s spiritual guide was not conspicuous among her former relatives and friends.
However, as the scene unfolded, there were indications of a spiritual guide orchestrating the whole meeting process while remaining in the background.
I see this in many cases.
The second manner in which we are met right after death involves a quiet, meaningful encounter with one’s spiritual guide where no one else is revealed in the immediate vicinity, as in Case 5.
Case 8 further illustrates this sort of meeting.
I find the duration of this first meeting with our guides does vary after each life depending upon the circumstances of that life.
Case 8 shows the very close relationships people have with their spiritual guides.
Many guides have strange sounding names, while others are rather conventional.
I find it interesting that the old-fashioned religious term of having a “guardian angel” is now used metaphysically to denote an empathetic spirit.
To be honest, this is a term I once denigrated as being foolishly loaded with wishful thinking and representing an out-dated mythology at odds with the modern world.
I don’t have that belief anymore about guardian angels.
I am repeatedly told that the soul itself is androgynous, and yet, in the same breath, clients declare sex is not an unimportant factor.
I have learned all souls can and do assume male and female mental impressions toward other entities as a form of identity preference.
Cases 6 and 7 show the importance of the newly arrived soul in seeing familiar “faces” identified by gender.
This is also true of the next case.
Another reason why I selected Case 8 is to indicate how and why souls choose to visually appear in human form to others in the spirit world.
The silence … so peaceful …
Is anyone coming to meet you?
Is Rachel a soulmate who has been with you in other lives, or is she someone who always remains here?
Are you locked into male or female attributes during your spiritual existence?
Eventually, this natural preference evens out.
Would you describe how Rachel’s soul actually looks to you at this moment?
A youngish woman … as I remember her best … small, with delicate features … a determined expression on her face … so much knowledge and love.
Then you have known Rachel on Earth?
Once, long ago, she was close to me in life … now she is my guardian.
And what do you feel when you look at her?
A calmness … tranquility … love …
Do you and Rachel actually look at each other with eyes in a human way?
What can you do on Earth with your eyes that can also be done in the spirit world?
I have heard about the light of spiritual identity being reflected in the human eyes of a soulmate expressed in a variety of ways from many clients.
Are you saying that sometimes on Earth when two people look at each other, they may feel they have known one another before?
Yes, it’s deja vu.
Yeah, otherwise you feel a little lost at first … lonesome … and maybe confused, too … seeing people as they were helps me get used to things here faster when I first come back, and seeing Rachel is always a big boost.
Does Rachel present herself to you in human form right after each death on Earth as a way of getting you readjusted to the spirit world?
I feel better when I see others I have known before too …
And do you speak to these people?
No one speaks, we communicate by the mind.
Telepathically?
Is it possible for souls to have private conversations which cannot be telepathically picked up by others?
… for intimacy—yes.
How is this done?
By touch—it’s called touching communication.
When two spirits come so close to each other they are conjoined, my subjects say they can send private thoughts by touch which passes between them as “electrical sound impulses.” In most instances, subjects in hypnosis do not wish to talk to me about these personal confidences.
Could you clarify for me how human features can be projected by you as a soul?
From … my mass of energy … I just think of the features I want … but I can’t tell you what gives me the ability to do this.
Well, then, can you tell me why you and the other souls project certain features at different times?
It depends on where you are in your movements around here … when you see another … and your state of mind then.
Spiritual “territory” will be explained as we proceed further into the spirit world.
Are you telling me that a soul may show you one face at the gateway to the spirit world and another image later in a different situation?
Like I was telling you, a lot of how we present ourselves to each other depends on what we are feeling right then … what relationship we have with a certain person and where we are.
Sure, and it works both ways … it’s interconnecting.
Then, how can we know the true character of a soul’s consciousness with all these changes in each other’s image?
Well, if in each of our past lives we have a different face, which one do we assume between lives?
What about communication without projecting features?
Sure, we do that—it’s normal—but I mentally associate with people more quickly with features.
Do you favor projecting a certain set of facial features?
Hmm … I like the face with the mustache … having a rock-hard jaw …
You mean when you were Jeff Tanner, the cowpuncher from Texas in the life we discussed earlier?
So, this goes back to what you were saying about all of us really only having one identity, regardless of the number of facial features we might project as souls?
Are we talking about the more immature souls, then?
I think of the spirit world as a place of supreme all-knowing intelligent consciousness and you make it appear that souls have moods and vanity as though they were back on Earth?
People are people no matter how they look on their physical worlds.
Oh, do you see souls who have gone to planets other than Earth?
Once in a while …
What features do souls from other planets besides Earth show you?
I … kind of stick with my own people, but we can assume any features we want for communication …
Is this ability to transmit features to each other as souls a gift the creator provided for us based upon spiritual need?
How should I know—I’m not God!
The concept of souls having fallibility comes as a surprise to some people.
The statements of Case 8 and all my other clients indicate most of us are still far from perfect beings in the spirit world.
The essential purpose of reincarnation is self-improvement.
The psychological ramifications of our development, both in and out of the spirit world, is the foundation of my work.
We have seen the importance of meeting other entities while entering the spirit world.
Besides uniting with our guides and other familiar beings, I have mentioned a third form of reentry after death.
This is the rather disconcerting manner in which a soul is met by no one.
Although it is an uncommon occurrence for most of my clients, I still feel a little sorry for those subjects who describe how they are pulled by unseen forces all alone to their final destinations, where contact is finally made with others.
This would be akin to landing in a foreign country where you have been before, but without any baggage handlers or a tourist information desk to assist you with directions.
I suppose what bothers me the most about this type of entry is the apparent lack of any soul acclimation.
My own conceptions of what it must be like to be alone at the spiritual gateway and beyond is not shared by those souls who utilize the option of going solo.
Actually, people in this category are experienced travelers.
As older, mature souls, they seem to require no initial support system.
They know right where they are going after death.
I suspect the process is accelerated for them as well, because they manage to more rapidly wind up where they belong than those who stop to meet others.
Case 9 is a client who has had a great number of lives, spanning thousands of years.
About eight lives before his current one, people finally stopped meeting him at the spiritual gate.
What happens to you at the moment of death?
I feel a great sense of release and I move out fast.
I shoot up like a column of light and I’m on my way.
Has it always been this fast for you?
No, only after my last series of lives.
I know the way, I don’t need to see anybody—I’m in a hurry.
And it doesn’t bother you that you are not met by anyone?
There was a time when it was good, but I don’t require that sort of thing anymore.
Whose decision was it to allow you to enter the spirit world without assistance?
It was … a mutual decision … between my teacher and me … when I knew I could handle things by myself.
And you don’t feel rather lost or lonely right now?
Explain to me how this pulling process works which will take you to your destination?
I am riding on a wave … a beam of light.
Is this beam electromagnetic, or what?
Well … it’s similar to the bands of a radio with someone turning the dial and finding the right frequency for me.
Are you saying you are being guided by an invisible force without much voluntary control and that you can’t speed things up as you did right after death?
Who does it for you?
The ones in control … I don’t really know.
My mind is in tune with the movement … I flow with the resonance …
Yes, the wave beam … vibrates … I am locked into this, too.
I’m not sure I understand how light and vibration combine to set up directional bands.
Think of a monster tuning fork inside a flashing strobe light.
Oh, then there is energy here?
Then your maturity level does give you some element of control in the rate and direction of travel.
Okay, stay with this and describe to me what happens next.
I’m moving alone … being homed into my proper space … going where I belong.
In hypnosis, the analytical conscious mind works in conjunction with the unconscious mind to receive and answer messages directed to our deep-seated memories.
The subject in Case 9 is an electrical engineer and thus he utilized some technical descriptions to express his spiritual sensations.
This client’s predisposition to explain his thoughts on soul travel in technical terms was encouraged, but not dictated, by my suggestions.
All subjects bring their own segments of knowledge to bear on answering my questions about the spirit world.
This case used physical laws familiar to him to describe motion, whereas another person might have said souls move in this tract within a vacuum.
Before continuing with the passage of souls into the spirit world, I want to discuss those entities who either have not made it this far after physical death, or will be diverted from the normal travel route.
THERE are souls who have been so severely damaged they are detached from the mainstream of souls going back to a spiritual home base.
Compared to all returning entities, the number of these abnormal souls is not large.
However, what has happened to them on Earth is significant because of the serious effect they have on other incarnated souls.
In the first instance, displacement is of the soul’s own choosing, while in the second case, spiritual guides deliberately remove these souls from further association with other entities for an indeterminate period.
In both situations, the guides of these souls are intimately concerned with rehabilitation, but because the circumstances are quite different between each type of displaced soul, I will treat them separately.
The first type we call ghosts.
These spirits refuse to go home after physical death and often have unpleasant influences on those of us who would like to finish out our own human lives in peace.
These displaced souls are sometimes falsely called “demonic spirits” because they are accused of invading the minds of people with harmful intent.
The subject of negative spirits has produced serious investigations in the field of parapsychology.
Unfortunately, this area of spirituality has also attracted a fringe element of the unscrupulous associated with the occult, who prey on the emotions of susceptible people.
The troubled spirit is an immature entity with unfinished business in a past life on Earth.
They may have no relation to the living person who is disrupted by them.
It is true that some people are convenient and receptive conduits for negative spirits who wish to express their querulous nature.
This means that someone who is in a deep meditative state of consciousness might occasionally pick up annoying signal patterns from a discar-nated being whose communications can range from the frivolous to provocative.
These unsettled entities are not spiritual guides.
Real guides are healers and don’t intrude with acrimonious messages.
Researchers who have specialized in the phenomena of ghosts indicate those disturbed entities are caught in a no-man’s land between the lower astral planes of Earth and the spirit world.
From my own research, I don’t believe these souls are lost in space, nor are they demonic.
They choose to remain within the Earth plane after physical death for a time by their own volition due to a high level of discontent.
In my opinion, they are damaged souls because they evidence confusion, despair, and even hostility to such an extent they want their guides to stay away from them.
We do know a negative, displaced entity can be reached and handled by various means, such as exorcism, to get them to stop interfering with human beings.
Possessing spirits can be persuaded to leave and eventually make a proper transition into the spirit world.
Another is that since we endure so many upheavals in our physical universe, then spiritual irregularities and deviations from the normal exodus of souls ought to be anticipated as well.
Also ghosts only represent a divided portion of a disturbed soul’s energy while the rest has returned to the spirit world for reunification.
When they are ready, these souls will be taken by the hand away from Earth’s astral plane and guided to their proper place in the spirit world.
I turn now to the far more prevalent second type of disturbed soul.
These are souls who have been involved with evil acts.
There are mentally ill people who feel driven by opposing forces of good and evil over which they believe they have no control.
After working for years with the superconscious minds of people under hypnosis, I have come to the conclusion that the five-sensory human can negatively act upon a soul’s psyche.
We express our eternal self through dominant biological needs and the pressures of environmental stimuli which are temporary to the incarnated soul.
Although there is no hidden, sinister self within our human form, some souls are not fully assimilated.
People not in harmony with their bodies feel detached from themselves in life.
This condition does not excuse souls from doing their utmost to prevent evil involvement on Earth.
We see this in human conscience.
It is important we distinguish between what is exerting a negative force on our mind and what is not.
Hearing an inner voice which may suggest self-destruction to ourselves or someone else is not a demonic spiritual entity, an alien presence, nor a malevolent renegade guide.
Negative forces emanate from ourself.
The destructive impulses of emotional disorders, if left untreated, inhibit soul development.
Those of us who have experienced unresolved personal trauma in our lives carry the seeds of our own destruction.
This anguish affects our soul in such a way that it seems we are not whole.
For instance, excessive craving and addictive behavior, which is the outgrowth of personal pain, inhibits the expression of a healthy soul and may even hold a soul in bondage to its host body.
On the positive side, Earth’s international level of consciousness toward human suffering appears to be rising.
I’ve been told that in every era of Earth’s bloody history there has always been a significant number of souls unable to resist and successfully counter human cruelty.
We see how children can be so damaged by physical and emotional family abuse that, as adults, they commit premeditated acts of atrocity without feelings of remorse.
Since souls are not created perfect, their nature can be contaminated during the development of such a life form.
If our transgressions are especially serious we call them evil.
My subjects say to me no soul is inherently evil, although it may acquire this label in hu- man life.
Pathological evil in humans is characterized by feelings of personal impotence and weakness which is stimulated by helpless victims.
The evolution of souls involves a transition from imperfection to perfection based upon overcoming many difficult body assignments during their task-oriented lives.
Souls may also have a predisposition for selecting environments where they consistently don’t work well, or are subverted.
Thus, souls may have their identity damaged by poor life choices.
However, all souls are held accountable for their conduct in the bodies they occupy.
But what happens to souls who have, through their bodies, caused extreme suffering to another?
If a soul is not capable of ameliorating the most violent human urges in its host body, how is it held accountable in afterlife?
On the wall of my office hangs an Egyptian painting, “The Judgment Scene,” as represented in the Book of the Dead, which is a mythological ritual of death over 7,000 years old.
The ancient Egyptians had an obsession with death and the world beyond the grave because, in their cosmic pantheon, death explained life.
The picture shows a newly deceased man arriving in a place located between the land of the living and the kingdom of the dead.
He stands by a set of scales about to be judged for his past deeds on Earth.
The master of ceremonies is the god Anubis, who carefully weighs the man’s heart on one pan of the scale against the ostrich feather of truth on the opposite side.
The heart, not the head, represented the embodiment of a person’s soul-conscience to the Egyptians.
It is a tense moment.
A crocodile-headed monster is crouched nearby with his mouth open, ready to devour the heart if the man’s wrongs outweigh the good he did in life.
Failure at the scales would end the existence of this soul.
I get quite a few comments from my clients about this picture.
A metaphysically oriented person would insist no one is denied entrance into the kingdom of afterlife, regardless of how unfavorably balanced the scales might be toward past conduct.
To answer this question, I should begin by mentioning that a large segment of society believes all souls do not go to the same place.
More moderate theology no longer stresses the idea of hellfire and brimstone for sinners.
However, many religious sects indicate a spiritual coexistence of two mental states of good and evil.
For the “bad” soul there are ancient philosophical pronouncements denoting a separation from the God-Essence as a means of punishment after death.
The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a source of religious belief thousands of years older than the Bible, describes the state of consciousness between lives as a time when “the evil we have perpetrated projects us into spiritual separation.”
If the peoples of the East believed in a special spiritual location for evil doers, was this idea similar to the concept of purgatory in the Western world?
From its earliest beginnings, Christian doctrine defined purgatory as a transitory state of temporary banishment for sins of a minor nature against humanity.
The Christian purgatory is supposed to be a place of atonement, isolation, and suffering.
When all negative karma is removed, these souls are eventually allowed into heaven.
On the other hand, souls committing major sins are condemned to hell forever.
I am told all souls go to one spirit world after death where everyone is treated with patience and love.
However, I have learned that certain souls do undergo separation in the spirit world, and this happens at the time of their orientation with guides.
They are not activated along the same travel routes as other souls.
Those of my subjects who have been impeded by evil report that souls whose influence was too weak to turn aside a human impulse to harm others will go into seclusion upon reentering the spirit world.
These souls don’t appear to mix with other entities in the conventional manner for quite a while.
I have also noticed that those beginner souls who are habitually associated with intensely negative human conduct in their first series of lives must endure individual spiritual isolation.
Ultimately, they are placed together in their own group to intensify learning under close supervision.
This is not punishment, but rather a kind of purgatory for the restructuring of self-awareness with these souls.
Because wrongdoing takes so many forms on Earth, spiritual instruction and the type of isolation used is varied for each soul.
The nature of these variations apparently is evaluated during orientation at the end of each life.
Relative time of seclusion and reindoctrination is not consistent either.
For instance, I have had reports about maladjusted spirits who have returned back to Earth directly after a period of seclusion in order to expunge themselves as soon as possible by a good incarnated performance.
Here is an example, as told to me by a soul who was acquainted with one of these spirits.
Do souls bear responsibility for their involvement with flawed human beings who injure others in life?
Yes, those who have wronged others savagely in a life—I knew one of those souls.
What was the extent of his punishment?
What does “more strict” mean to you in the spirit world?
Well, my friend didn’t go back with us … his friends … after this sad life where he hurt this girl.
Did he come through the same spiritual gateway as yourself when he died?
Yes, but he did not meet with anybody … he went directly to a place where he was alone with the teacher.
And then what happened to him?
After awhile … not long … he returned to Earth again as a woman … where people were cruel … physically abusive … it was a deliberate choice … my friend needed to experience that …
Do you think this soul blamed the human brain of his former host body for hurting the girl?
If this friend of yours did not gain understanding and continued involving himself with humans who committed wrongful acts, could he be destroyed as a soul by someone in the spirit world?
You can’t destroy energy exactly … but it can be reworked … negativity which is unmanageable … in many lives … can be readjusted.
… Not by destruction … remodeling …
Case 10 did not respond further to this line of questioning, and other subjects who know something about these damaged souls are rather sparse with their information.
Later, we will learn a bit more about the formation and restoration of intelligent energy.
Most errant souls are able to solve their own problems of contamination.
The price we pay for our misdeeds and the rewards received for good conduct revolve around the laws of karma.
Perpetrators of harm to others will do penance by setting themselves up as future victims in a karmic cycle of justice.
The Bhagavad Gita, another early Eastern scripture which has stood the test of thousands of years, has a passage which says, “souls of evil influence must redeem their virtue.”
No study of life after death would have any meaning without addressing how karma relates to causality and justice for all souls.
Karma by itself does not denote good or bad deeds.
Rather it is the result of one’s positive and negative actions in life.
The statement, “there are no accidents in our lives,” does not mean karma by itself impels.
What it does is propel us forward by teaching lessons.
Our future destiny is influenced by a past from which we cannot escape, especially when we injure others.
The key to growth is understanding we are given the ability to make mid-course corrections in our life and having the courage to make necessary changes when what we are doing is not working for us.
By conquering fear and taking risks, our karmic pattern adjusts to the effects of new choices.
At the end of every life, rather than having a monster waiting to devour our souls, we serve as our most severe critic in front of teacher-guides.
This is why karma is both just and merciful.
With the help of our spiritual counselors and peers we decide on the proper mode of justice for our conduct.
Some people who believe in reincarnation also think if negative souls do not learn their lessons within a reasonable span of lives, they will be eliminated and replaced by more willing souls.
My subjects deny this premise.
There is no set path of self-discovery designed for all souls.
As one subject told me, “souls are assigned to Earth for the duration of the war.”
This means souls are given the time and opportunity to make changes for growth.
Souls who continue to display negative attitudes through their human hosts must overcome these difficulties by continually making an effort to change.
From what I have seen, no negative karma remains attached to a soul who is willing to work during their many lives on this planet.
Souls must learn to cope in different ways with each new human being assigned to them.
The permanent identity of a soul stamps the human mind with a distinctive character which is individual to that soul.
However, I find there is a strange dual nature between the soul mind and human brain.
AFTER those entities who meet us during our homecoming have dispersed, we are ready to be taken to a space of healing.
This will be followed by another stop involving the soul’s reorientation to a spiritual environment.
In this place we are often examined by our guide.
I tend to call the cosmology of all spiritual locations as places, or spaces, simply for convenient identification because we are dealing with a non-physical universe.
The similarity of descriptions among clients of what they do as souls at the next two combined stops is remarkable, although they do have different names for them.
I hear such terms aS: chambers, travel berths, and inter-space stopover zones, but the most common is “the place of healing.”
I think of the healing station as a field hospital, or MASH unit, for damaged souls coming off Earth’s battlefields.
I have selected a rather advanced male subject who has been through this revitalization process many times to describe the nature of this next stop.
After you leave the friends who greeted you following your death, where does your soul go next in the spirit world?
I am alone for a while … moving through vast distances …
Then what happens to you?
I am being guided by a force I can’t see, into a more enclosed space—an opening into a place of pure energy.
What is this area like?
For me … it is the vessel of healing.
Give me as much detail as possible about what you experience here.
Is someone bathing you, or is this light beam enveloping you from out of nowhere?
I have heard this place is similar to taking a refreshing shower after a hard day’s work.
You also don’t have a physical body anymore, so how can this energy shower heal a soul?
Are you saying the ravages of the physical body and the human mind leaves an emotional mark on the soul after death?
Even though you are now separated from that body forever?
Okay, now I want you to finish with your shower of healing and tell me what you feel.
Does the shower have the same effect upon everyone?
When I am restored, I leave here and go to a quiet place to talk to my guide.
This place I have come to call the shower of healing is only a prelude for the rehabilitation of returning souls.
The orientation stage which immediately follows , involves a substantial counseling session with one’s guide.
The newly refreshed soul arrives at this station to undergo a debriefing of the life just ended.
Orientation is also designed as an intake interview to provide further emotional release and readjustment back into the spirit world.
People in hypnosis who discuss the type of counseling which goes on during orientation say their guides are gentle but probing.
Imagine your favorite elementary school teacher and you have the idea.
Think of a firm but concerned entity who knows all about your learning habits, your strong and weak points, and your fears, who is always ready to work with you as long as you continue to try.
When you don’t, everything remains stationary in your development.
Nothing can be hidden by students from their spiritual teachers.
No subterfuge or deception exists in a telepathic world.
There are a multitude of differences in orientation scenes depending upon the souls’ individual makeup and their state of mind after the life just ended.
Souls report their orientation often takes place in a room.
The furnishings of these settings and the intensity of this first conference can vary after each life.
The case below gives a brief example of an orientation scene which attests to the desire of higher forces to bring comfort to the returning soul.
At the center of this place I found my bedroom where I was so happy as a child.
I see my rose-covered wallpaper and four-poster bed with the squeaky springs under a thick, pink quilt made for me by my grandmother.
My grandmother and I used to have heart-to-heart chats whenever I was troubled and she is here, too—just sitting on the edge of my bed with my favorite stuffed animals around her—waiting for me.
Her wrinkled face is full of love, as always.
After a while I see she is actually my guide Amephus.
I talk to Amephus about the sad and happy times of the life I have finished.
I know I made mistakes, but she is so kind to me.
We laugh and cry together while I reminisce.
Then we discuss all the things I didn’t do that I might have done with my life.
But in the end it’s okay.
She knows I must rest in this beautiful world.
I’m going to relax.
I don’t care if I ever go back to Earth again because my real home is here.
Apparently, the more advanced souls do not require any orientation at this stage.
This does not mean the ten percent of my clients in this category just sail right by their guides with a wave upon their return from Earth.
Everybody is held accountable for their past lives.
Performance is judged upon how each individual interpreted and acted upon their life roles.
Intake interviews for the advanced souls are conducted with master teachers later.
The less experienced entities are usually given special attention by counselors because the abrupt transition from the physical to a spiritual form is more difficult for them.
The next case I have selected has a more in-depth therapeutic spiritual orientation.
The exploration of attitudes and feelings with a view to reorienting future behavior is typical of guides.
The client in Case 13 is a strong, imposing thirty-two-year-old woman of above-average height and weight.
Dressed in jeans, boots, and a loose-fitting sweat shirt, Hester arrived at my office one day in a state of agitation.
She was dissatisfied with her life as a successful real estate broker as being too materialistic and unfulfilling.
Hester also felt she lacked feminine sexuality.
She mentioned having a closet full of beautiful clothes which were “hateful to wear.
” This client then told me how she had easily manipulated men all her life because, “There is a male aggression about me which also makes me feel incomplete as a woman.
” As a young girl, she avoided dolls and wearing dresses because she was more interested in competitive sports with boys.
Her masculine feelings had not changed with age, although she had found a man who became her husband because he accepted her dominance in their relationship.
Hester said she enjoyed sex with him as long as she was in physical control and that he found this exciting.
In addition, my client complained of headaches on the right side of her head above the ear which, after extensive medical examinations, doctors had attributed to stress.
During our session, I learned this subject had experienced a recent series of male lives, culminating with a short life as a prosecuting attorney called Ross Feldon in the state of Oklahoma during the 1880s.
As Ross, my client had committed suicide at age thirty-three in a hotel room by shooting himself in the head.
Ross was in despair over the direction his life had taken as a courtroom prosecutor.
As the dialogue progresses, the reader will notice displays of intense emotion.
Now that you have left the shower of healing, where are you going?
To see my advisor.
And who is that?
… Dees … no … his name is Clodees.
Did you talk to Clodees when you entered the spirit world?
Why are you going to see Clodees now?
Because I killed myself.
When a person kills himself on Earth does this mean they will receive some sort of punishment as a spirit?
No, no, there is no such thing here as punishment—that’s an Earth condition.
Clodees will be disappointed that I bailed out early and didn’t have the courage to face my difficulties.
By choosing to die as I did means I have to come back later and deal with the same thing all over again in a different life.
I just wasted a lot of time by checking out early.
So, no one will condemn you for committing suicide?
Well, my friends won’t give me any pats on the back either—I feel sadness at what I did.
This is the usual spiritual attitude toward suicide, but I want to add that those who escape from chronic physical pain or almost total incapacity on Earth by killing themselves feel no remorse as souls.
Their guides and friends also have a more accepting view toward this motivation for suicide.
All right, let’s proceed into your conference with Clodees.
First describe your surroundings as you enter this space to see your advisor.
I go into a room—with walls … Oh, it’s the Buckhorn!
What’s that?
You sound a little depressed at the prospect of an intimate conversation with your guide about your last life?
Do what right?
You don’t feel you met the contract you had with your advisor about lessons to be learned as Ross?
I can see you are upset, but don’t you think …
I want you to take a deep breath and go further into the Buckhorn Bar and tell me what you do.
I float in and sit down across from Clodees at a round table near the front of the bar.
Now that you are near Clodees, do you think he is as upset as you are over this past life?
The counseling input of a directive guide gives the healing process of our soul a boost during orientation, but that does not mean the defensive barriers to progress are completely removed.
The painful emotional memories from our past do not die as easily as our bodies.
Hester must see her negative past life script as Ross clearly, without distorted perceptions.
Recreating spiritual orientation scenes during hypnosis assists me as a therapist.
I have found the techniques of psychodramatic role playing to be useful in exposing feelings and old beliefs related to current behavior.
Case 13 had quite a long orientation which I have condensed.
At this juncture of the case I shifted my questioning to involve the subject’s guide.
Within this counseling mode I also want to initiate a role transference where Hester-Ross will speak the thoughts of Clodees.
The integration of a subject with their guide is a means of eliciting assistance from these higher entities and bringing problems into sharper focus.
I sometimes sense even my own guide is directing me in these sessions.
I am cautious about summoning up guides without good cause.
Facilitating communication directly with a client’s guide always has an uncertain outcome.
If my intrusion is clumsy or unnecessary, guides will block a subject’s response by silence or use metaphoric language which is obscure.
I have had guides speak through a subject’s vocal chords in raspy tones which are so discordant I can hardly understand the responses to questions.
When subjects talk for their guides, rather than guides speaking for themselves through the subject, usually the cadence of speech is not as broken.
In this case, Clodees comes through Hester-Ross easily and allows me some latitude in working with his client.
Yes, I am.
I … think so.
You know … you could have done better…
I … tried … but I fell short of the goal …
If you could change anything about your life, what would it be?
Respond as Ross.
Not to be … corrupted … by power and money.
Answer as Clodees.
Why did you let these things detract from your original commitment?
I wanted to belong … to feel important in the community … to rise above others and be admired … for my strength.
Respond as Clodees.
Speak as Ross.
Yes … that’s true … I don’t have to explain—you know everything anyway.
Answer as Ross.
If I hadn’t exerted power over these people they would have controlled me.
Ah, you were corrupted by the system—explain this to me.
Why did you feel responsible for prosecuting criminals who were guilty of hurting others?
Few of those … most were … just ordinary people like my parents who got caught up in the system … needing money to survive … and there were those who were … sick in the head …
Don’t you see, it didn’t work for me—I was turned into a murderer by a primitive society!
And so you murdered yourself?
Why didn’t you help me more—when I started as a public defender?
What benefit do you get from thinking I should pick you up at every turn?
Ross, if I may interrupt—I believe Clodees is inquiring into the payoff for you from both the pain you feel now and strokes you get from blaming him over your last life.
Wanting sympathy … I guess.
I know I missed the signs you set up … I wasted opportunities … I was afraid …
Respond as Clodees to your statement.
What do you value most about who you are?
Answer your guide.
You left that assignment early and now I see you missing opportunities again—being afraid to take risks—taking paths which damage you—trying to become someone who is not you and there is sadness again.
Recreating the orientation stage does produce abrupt transitions during my hypnosis sessions.
While Case 13 is speaking as Clodees, notice how her responses take on a more lucid and decisive quality which is different from either my client Hester, or her former self as Ross.
I am not always successful with my subjects translating their guides’ comments so insightfully in former spiritual orientations.
Nevertheless, past life memories often spill over into contemporary problems in whatever spiritual setting is selected.
Whether my subject or her guide actually directed the conversation in the Buckhorn Bar scene while I moved the time frame around does not matter to me.
After all, Ross Feldon as a person is dead.
But Hester is caught in the same quagmire, and I want to do what I can to break this destructive pattern of behavior.
I spend a few minutes reviewing with this subject what her guide has indicated about lack of self-concept, alienation, and lost values.
After asking Clodees for his continued assistance, I close the orientation scene and immediately take Hester to a later spiritual stage just before her rebirth today.
With all the knowledge of who you were as Ross, and having a greater understanding of your real spiritual identity after your stay in the spirit world, why did you choose your current body?
I chose to be a woman so people would not feel intimidated by me.
They won’t see a prosecuting attorney dressed in black in a courtroom— this time I am a surprise package!
What kind of men?
The big guys—the power structure in society—catch then when they are lulled into a false sense of security because I’m a woman.
Catch them and do what?
Nail them—to save the little guy from the sharks who want to eat up all the small fish in this world.
What wrong direction?
Give me an example?
And how does this hurt you, Hester?
Then do you think your motivations were wrong in choosing to be a female?
Before finishing this case, I should touch on the issue of homosexuality.
Most of my subjects select the bodies of one gender over another 75 percent of the time.
This pattern is true of all but the advanced souls, who maintain more of a balance in choosing to be men and women.
A gender preference by a majority of earthbound souls does not mean they are unhappy the other 25 percent of the time as males or females.
Hester is not necessarily gay or bi-sexual because of her body choice.
Homosexuals may or may not be comfortable with their anatomy as humans.
When I do have a client who is gay, they often ask if their homosexuality is the result of choosing to be “the wrong sex” in this life.
When their sessions are over this inquiry is usually answered.
Sometimes I find that gay people have chosen in advance of their current lives to experiment with a sex that was seldom used in former lives.
Being gay carries a sexual stigma in our society which presents a more difficult road in life.
When this road is chosen by one of my clients, it can usually be traced to a karmic need to accelerate personal understanding of the complex differences in gender identity as related to certain events in their past.
Case 13 chose to be a woman in this life to try and get over the stumbling blocks experienced as Ross Feldon.
This human condition is perplexing to people attracted to reincarnation.
Why do you think you had no conscious memory about your life as Ross Feldon?
When we choose a body and make a plan before coming back to Earth, there is an agreement with our advisors.
An agreement about what?
We agree … not to remember … other lives.
Learning from a blank slate is better than knowing in advance what could happen to you because of what you did before.
But wouldn’t knowing about your past life mistakes be valuable in avoiding the same pitfalls in this life?
Are there any other reasons?
Without having old memories, our advisors say there is less preoccupation for … trying to … avenge the past … to get even for the wrongs done to you.
That’s why I came to you.
And do you still think a total blackout of our eternal spiritual life on Earth is essential to progress?
By friends, you mean entities from the spirit world?
Uh-huh … they give you hints, by flashing ideas—I’ve done it.
Nevertheless, you had to come to me to unlock your conscious amnesia.
Otherwise, your amnesia would have remained intact?
Yes, that would have meant I wasn’t supposed to know certain things yet.
In my opinion, when clients are unable to go into hypnosis at any given time, or if they have only sketchy memories in trance, there is a reason for this blockage.
This does not mean these people have no past memories, just that they are not ready to have them exposed.
My client knew something was hindering her growth and wanted it revealed.
The superconscious identity of the soul houses our continuous memory, including goals.
When the time in our lives is appropriate, we must harmonize human material needs with our soul’s purpose for being here.
I try to take a common sense approach in bringing past and present experiences into alignment.
Our eternal identity never leaves us alone in the bodies we choose, despite our current status.
In reflection, meditation, or prayer, the memories of who we really are do filter down to us in selective thought each day.
In small, intuitive ways—through the cloud of amnesia—we are given clues for the justification of our being.
After desensitizing the source of her headaches, I completed my session with Hester by reinforcing her choice to be a woman for reasons other than intimidating men.
I gave her permission to lower her defenses a little and be less aggressive.
We discussed options for restructuring occupational goals toward the helping professions and the possibilities of volunteer service work.
She was finally able to see her life today as a great opportunity for learning rather than a failure of gender choice.
After a case is completed, I never cease to admire the brutal honesty of souls.
When a soul has led a productive life beneficial to themselves and those around them, I notice they return to the spirit world with enthusiasm.
However, when subjects like Case 13 report they wasted a past life, especially from early suicide, then they describe going back rather dejected.
When orientation is upsetting to a subject, I find an underlying reason is the abruptness with which a soul is once again in full possession of all past knowledge.
After physical death, unencumbered by a human body, the soul has a sudden influx of perception.
The stupid things we did in life hit us hard in orientation.
I see more relaxation and greater clarity of thought as I move my subjects further into the spirit world.
Humans have the raw, negative emotions of anger and hate as an outgrowth of their fear and pain connected with survival going back to the Stone Age.
Both positive and negative emotions are mixed between soul and host for their mutual benefit.
If a soul only knew love and peace, it would gain no insight and never truly appreciate the value of these positive feelings.
The test of reincarnation for a soul coming to Earth is the conquering of fear in a human body.
A soul grows by trying to overcome all negative emotions connected to fear through perseverance in many lifetimes, often returning to the spirit world bruised or hurt, as Case 13 indicated.
Some of this negativity can be retained, even in the spirit world, and may reappear in another life with a new body.
On the other hand, there is a trade-off.
It’s in joy and unabashed pleasure that the true nature of an individual soul is revealed on earth in the face of a happy human being.
Orientation conferences with our guides allow us to begin the long process of self-evaluation between lives.
Soon we will have another conference, this time with more master beings in attendance.
Occasionally, a susceptible individual in a traumatic situation will say they had an out-of-body experience with nightmarish visions of being taken by frightening specters into an afterlife of darkness where they were sentenced in front of demonic judges.
In these cases, I suspect a strong preconditioned belief system of hell.
In the quiet, relaxing state of hypnosis, with continuity on all mental levels, my subjects report that the initial orientation session with their guides prepares them to go before a panel of superior beings.
However, the words courtroom and trial are not used to describe these proceedings.
A number of my cases have called these wise beings, directors and even judges, but most refer to them as a Council of Masters or Elders.
All soul evaluation conferences, be they with our guides, peers, or a panel of masters have one thing in common.
The feedback and past life analysis we receive in terms of judgement is based upon the original intent of our choices as much as the actions of a lifetime.
Our motivations are questioned and criticized, but not condemned in such a way as to make us suffer.
Karmic payment will come in a future life.
I have been told that our spiritual masters constantly remind us that because the human brain does not have an innate moral sense of ethics, conscience is the soul’s responsibility.
Nevertheless, there is overwhelming forgiveness in the spirit world.
This world is ageless and so too are our learning tasks.
We will be given other chances in our struggle for growth.
When the initial conference with our guide is over, we leave the place of orientation and join a coordinated flow of activity involving the transit of enormous numbers of other souls into a kind of central receiving station.
ALL souls, regardless of experience, eventually arrive at a central port in the spirit world which I call the staging area.
I have said there are variations in the speed of soul movement right after death, depending upon spiritual maturity.
Once past the orientation station there seems to be no further travel detours for anyone entering this space of the spirit world.
Apparently, large numbers of returning souls are conveyed in a spiritual form of mass transit.
Sometimes souls are escorted by their guides to this area.
I find this practice is especially true for the younger souls.
Others are directed through by an unseen force which pulls them into the staging area and then beyond to waiting entities.
From what I am able to determine, accompaniment by other entities depends upon the volition of one’s guide.
In most cases haste is not an issue, but souls do not dawdle along on this leg of their journey.
The feelings we have along this path depend on our state of mind after each life.
The assembly and transfer of souls really involves two phases.
The staging area is not an encampment space.
Spirits are brought in, collected, and then projected out to their proper final destinations.
One of my clients described the staging area as resembling “the hub of a great wagon wheel, where we are transported from a center along the spokes to our designated places.”
My subjects say this region appears to them as having a large number of unacquainted spirits moving in and out of the hub in an efficient manner with no congestion.
Another person called this area “the Los Angeles freeway without gridlock.”
There may be other similar wheel hubs with freeway-type on and off ramps in the spirit world, but each client considers their own route to and from this center to be the only one.
The observations I hear about the nature of the spirit world when entering the staging area have definitely changed from those first impressions of layering and foggy stratification.
It is as if the soul is now traveling through the loosely-wound arms of a mighty galactic cloud into a more unified celestial field.
While their spirits hover in the open arena of the staging area preparing for further transport out to prescribed spaces, I enjoy listening to the excitement in the voices of my subjects.
They are dazzled by an eternal world spread out before them and believe that somewhere within lies the nucleus of creation.
When they look at the fully opened canopy around them, subjects will state that the spirit world appears to be of varied luminescence.
I hear nothing about the inky blackness we associate with deep space.
The gatherings of souls that clients see in the foreground in this amphitheater appear as myriads of sharp star lights all going in different directions.
Some move fast while others drift.
The more distant energy concentrations have been pictured as “islands of misty veils.”
I am told the most outstanding characteristic of the spirit world is a continuous feeling of a powerful mental force directing everything in uncanny harmony.
People say this is a place of pure thought.
Thought takes many forms.
It is at this vantage point in their return that souls begin to anticipate meeting others who wait for them.
A few of these companions may have already been seen at the gateway, but most have not.
Without exception, souls who wish to contact each other, especially when on the move, do so by just thinking of the entity they want.
Suddenly, the individual called will appear in the soul mind of the traveler.
These telepathic communications by the energy of all spiritual entities allow for a non-visual affinity, while two energy forms who actually come near one another provide a more direct connection.
There is uniformity in the accounts of my subjects as to their manner of spiritual travel, routes, and destinations, although what they see along the way is distinctive with each person.
I searched through my case files to find a subject whose experiences along this route to an ultimate spiritual destination was both descriptive and yet representative of what many others have told me.
I selected an in- sightful, forty-one-year-old graphic designer with a mature soul.
This man’s soul had traveled over this course many times between a long span of lives.
You are now ready to begin the final portion of your homeward journey toward the place where your soul belongs in the spirit world.
On the count of three, all the details of this final leg of your travels will become clear to you.
It will be easy for you to report on everything you see because you are familiar with the route.
Are you ready?
Distances are … unlimited … endless space … forever …
So, are you telling me the spirit world is endless?
Changes how?
Then movement gives you the sense of a spherical spirit world?
Yes, but it’s only a feeling of … enclosed uniformity … when I am moving rapidly.
Why does rapid movement—your speed—give you the feeling of being in a bowl?
What do you mean by a line of contact?
Towards a specific destination.
How does moving with speed on a given line of travel change your observational perceptions of the spirit world to a feeling it is round?
By less freedom, do you mean less personal control?
Can you more precisely describe the movement of your soul along these curving contact lines?
Then, in this spiritual atmosphere, you don’t have the sense of density such as in water?
No, I don’t, but what I am trying to say is I’m being carried along as if I were in a current underwater.
Well, it’s as if we are all swimming—being carried along—in a swift current which we can’t control … under somebody’s direction … up and down from each other in space … with nothing solid around us.
Do you see other souls traveling in a purposeful way above and below you?
Yes, it’s as if we start in a stream and then all of us returning from death are pulled into a great river together.
When do the numbers of returning souls seem the highest to you?
When the rivers converge into … I can’t describe it …
Please try.
Later, in your normal travels as a soul, is it the same as being propelled around in streams and rivers as you have just described?
Who is doing the pushing while you are being taken home?
Entities such as your guide?
Above him, I think.
What else are you feeling at this moment?
Anything more?
Oh, I have some anticipation, too, while moving slowly with the energy current.
I see … a variety of lights … in patches … separated from each other by … galleries …
By galleries, do you mean a series of enclosures?
Mmm … more like a long … corridor … bulging out in places … stretching out away from me into the distance.
And the lights?
Are these clusters of people structurally separated from each other in the bulges along the corridor?
How do you see individual souls within the clusters?
Do these clumps represent various groups of soul energy masses with space between them?
Yes … they are separated into small groups … I am going to my own clump.
What else do you feel about them as you pass by on the way to your cluster?
I can feel their thoughts reaching out … so varied … but together too … such harmony … but …
I don’t know the ones I’m passing now … it doesn’t matter.
A long glow-worm, its sides bulging in and out … the movement is … rhythmic.
You mean the corridor itself appears to move?
Continue floating and tell me what happens to you next.
I’m at the edge of another corridor … I’m slowing down.
And how do you feel at this moment?
So you felt connections with those other corridors, even with spirits in them you might not know from past experience?
When you are moving around as a spirit, what is the major difference in your interactions with other souls, compared to being in human form on Earth?
You mean every spirit is friendly to every other spirit, regardless of prior associations in many settings?
That’s right, and it’s more than just being friendly.
How does this attitude manifest itself between souls who first meet?
By complete openness and acceptance.
Living on Earth must be difficult for souls, then?
And if the newer souls are struggling with these earth conditions, are they less efficient when working within the human mind?
In your opinion, might the newer souls tend to be more fragile and in need of group support upon returning to their cluster?
I have touched on the commonality of word usage by different clients to describe spiritual phenomena.
Case 14 offered us a few more.
I regularly hear such water-words as currents and streams used to explain a flowing directional movement, where a sky-word like cloud denotes a freedom of motion associated with drifting.
Visual images which call up expressions of energy mass and group clusters to indicate souls themselves are especially popular.
I have adopted some of this spiritual language myself.
By way of comparison with Case 14, the next case demonstrates a more insular perception of the spirit world from a soul with less maturity.
In Case 15, the transition of this soul from the staging area to her home cluster is fairly rapid in her mind.
The case is informative because it presents attributes of propriety felt by this soul to a designated space, as well as deference toward those who manage the system.
Because this subject is less experienced and a bit edgy over what she sees as a need for conformity, we are given another interpretation of spiritual guidelines for group placement.
I’m … going … outward, somehow …
I have come into … a grand arena … I see many others … criss-crossing around me …
Yes … nearby … otherwise I would be lost … it’s so … vast …
I’m … carried forward … rapidly … straight past others … then I’m in … an empty space … open …
Does this void mean everything is black around you?
Continue on and report back to me what you see next.
After a while I see … nests of people …
You mean groups of people?
Yes—like hives—I see them as bunches of moving lights … fireflies …
All right, keep moving and tell me what you feel?
Warmth … friendship … empathy … it’s dreamy … hmm …?
I have slowed way down—things are different.
More clearly defined —I know this place.
Have you reached your own hive ?
Not yet, I guess …
Just look about you and report back to me exactly what you see and feel.
There are … bunches of people … together … off in the distance … but … there!
People I know … some of my family … off in the distance … but … I don’t seem to be able to reach them!
I briefly stop my questioning.
This client’s father had a great influence in her most immediate past life and she needs additional calming techniques.
I also decide to reinforce her protective shield before continuing.
What do you think is the reason your father is off in the distance so you can’t reach him?
I don’t know …
Connect with your father—now!
It’s okay … he is telling me to be patient and everything will become clear to me … I want to go over there and be near him.
And what does he tell you about that?
He says … that he can always be in my mind if I need him and … I will learn to do this better , but he has to stay where he is …
What do you think is the basic reason for your father remaining in this other place?
He does not belong in my hive.
Anything else?
The … directors … they don’t … I’m not sure …
Normally, I try to avoid too much intervention when subjects are describing their spiritual transitions.
In this case, my client is confused and disoriented, so I offer a little guidance of my own.
Let’s analyze why you can’t reach your father’s position right now.
Are you satisfied with this procedure?
The final transit inward is especially important for the younger souls.
One client, upon awakening, described this scene as giving him the sense he was arriving back home at twilight after a long trip away.
Having passed from the countryside into his town, he finally reached the proper street.
The front windows of his neighbors’ houses were lit, and he could see people inside as he drove slowly past before reaching the driveway of his own home.
Although people in trance may use such words as “clumps” and “hives” to describe how their home spaces look from a distance, this view becomes more individualistic once they go into each cluster.
Then the subjects’ spiritual surroundings are associated with towns, schools, and other living areas identified with earthly landmarks of security and pleasure.
Now that you are stationary, what are your impressions?
Can we get a little closer to all of them?
What’s the problem?
But, you have reached your destination?
Does this tie in with the messages you received about your father?
Yes, it does.
Are you saying to me your soul energy cannot arbitrarily float anywhere—such as outside your group?
They are not in my group over there.
Define what you mean by over there?
These people are entities who are members of your own group?
I do see, but a few minutes ago you were quite distressed at not being able to get close to your father.
I know now he has his own gathering place with people.
Why didn’t you know that when we arrived here?
Why wasn’t your guide around to explain all this to you before you saw your father?
I don’t know.
And you don’t just drift over to those other groups for visits?
But mental contact offers no interference with their energy?
So, what you are telling me is that everyone here is located in their own group spaces and you don’t go wandering around visiting or making too much mental contact at the wrong times?
And you don’t feel confined by this custom?
Oh no, there are great expanses of space and such a sense of freedom here, as long as we pay attention to the rules.
The teachers help us, otherwise we would be lost.
It seemed to me you were lost when we first arrived here?
I didn’t connect … I wasn’t mentally in tune … I messed up … I don’t think you realize how big it is around here.
Some of my subjects find the transition from the gateway to group placement to be so rapid that they need time to adjust upon arrival.
When recalling their memories between homecoming and placement, my subjects sometimes express concern that an important individual was not present in light form or did not communicate with them telepathically.
Often this is a parent or spouse in the life just completed.
By the end of the transition stage, the reason usually becomes evident.
Frequently it has to do with embodiment.
We have seen how the average returning soul is overwhelmed by pleasure.
Familiar beings are clustered together in undulating masses of bright light.
On occasion, resonating musical sounds with specific chords guide the incoming traveler.
One subject remarked, “As I come near my place, there is a monotone of many voices sounding the letter A, like Aaaaa, for my recognition, and I can see them all vibrating fast as warm, bright energy, and I know these are the disembodied ones right now.”
What this means is that those souls who are currently incarnated in one or more bodies at the moment may not be actively engaged with welcoming anybody back.
Another subject explained, “It is as if they are sleeping on autopilot—we always know who is out and who is in.
” Those souls who are not totally discarnated radiate a dim light with low pulsating energy patterns and don’t seem to communicate much with anyone.
Even so, these souls are able to greet the returning soul in a quiet fashion within the group setting.
The sense of a barrier between various groups, as experienced by Case 15, has different versions among my subjects, depending upon the age of the soul.
I will have another perspective about mobility in the next case.
The average soul with a great deal of basic work to do describes the separation of their group from others as similar to being in different classrooms in the same schoolhouse.
I have also had clients who felt they were entirely separated in their own schoolhouse.
The analogy of spiritual schools directed by teacher-guides is used so often by people under hypnosis that it has become a habit for me to use the same terminology.
As I mentioned earlier, after souls arrive back into their soul groups, they are summoned to appear before a Council of Elders.
While the Council is not prosecutorial, they do engage in direct examination of a soul's activities before returning them to their groups.
It is not unusual for my subjects to have some difficulty providing me with full details of what transpires at these hearings, and I am sure these blocks are intentional.
Here is a report from one case.
“After I meet with my friends, my guide Veronica takes me to another place to meet with my panel of Elders.
She is at my side as an interpreter for what I don't understand and to provide support for explanations of my conduct in the last life.
At times, she speaks on my behalf as a kind of defense advocate but Quazel carries the most weight with the panel.
There are always the same six Elders in front of me who wear long white robes.
Their faces are kindly, and they evaluate my perceptions of the life I have just lived and how I could have done better with my talents and what I did that was beneficial.
I am freely allowed to express my frustrations and desires.
All the Elders are familiar to me, especially two of them who address me more than the others and who look younger than the rest.
I think I can distinguish appearances which are male or female.
Each has a special aspect in the way they question me but they are honest and truthful, and I am always treated fairly.
I can hide nothing from them, but sometimes I get lost when their thoughts are transmitted back and forth in the rapid communication between them.
When it is more than I can handle, Veronica translates what they are saying about me, although I have the feeling she does not tell me everything.
Before I return to Earth, they will want to see me a second time.”
Souls consider themselves having finally arrived home when they rejoin familiar classmates in group settings.
Their attendance here with certain other souls does resemble an educational placement system in form and function.
The criteria for group admission is based upon knowledge and a given developmental level.
As in any classroom situation, some students connect well with teachers and others less so.
MY impression of the people who believe we do have a soul is that they imagine all souls are probably mixed into one great congregation of space.
Many of my subjects believe this too, before their sessions begin.
After awakening, it is no wonder they express surprise with the knowledge that everyone has a designated place in the spirit world.
When I began to study life in the spirit world with people under hypnosis, I was unprepared to hear about the existence of organized soul support groups.
Larger secondary groups of entities are made up of giant sets of primary clusters as lily pads in one pond.
Spiritual ponds appear to be endless.
Within these ponds, I have never heard of a secondary group estimated at less than a thousand souls.
The many primary group clusters which make up one secondary group seem to have sporadic relationships, or no contact at all between clusters.
It is rare for me to find souls involved with each other in any meaningful way who are members of two different secondary groups, because the number of souls is so great it is not necessary
The smaller sub-group primary clusters vary in number, containing anywhere from three to twenty-five souls.
I am told the average assemblage is around fifteen, which is called the Inner Circle.
Soul acquaintanceships between members of different cluster groups usually involve peripheral roles in life on Earth.
An example would be a high school classmate who was once a close friend, but who you now see only at class reunions Members of the same cluster group are closely united for all eternity.
These tightly-knit clusters are often composed of like-minded souls with common objectives which they continually work out with each other.
Usually they choose lives together as relatives and close friends during their incarnations on Earth It is much more common for me to find a subject’s brother or sister from former lives in the same cluster group rather than souls who have been their parents.
Parents can meet us at the gateway to the spirit world after a death on Earth, but we may not see much of their souls in the spirit world.
This circumstance exists not for reasons of maturity, since a parent soul could be less developed than their human offspring.
Rather, it is more a question of social learning between siblings who are contemporary in one time frame.
Although parents are a child’s primary identification figures for both good and bad karmic effects, it is frequently our relations with spouses, brothers, sisters, and selected close friends over a whole lifetime that most influences personal growth.
This takes nothing away from the importance of parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents who serve us in different ways from another generation Figures 1 and 2 represent a random spiritual setting of souls.
In Figure 1, a soul in primary Group 1, located within the larger secondary Group A, would work closely with all other souls in Group 1.
However, some souls in primary Groups 9 and 10 could also work together.
The younger souls within secondary Groups A, B, and C would probably have little or no contact with each other in the spirit world or on Earth.
Close association between souls depends on their assigned proximity to one another in cluster groups, where there is a similarity of knowledge and affinity brought about by shared earthly experiences.
I HAVE never worked with a subject in trance who did not have a personal guide.
Some guides are more in evidence than others during hypnosis sessions.
It is my custom to ask subjects if they see or feel a discarnate presence in the room.
Often, a client will sense the presence of a discarnate figure before visualizing a face or hearing a voice.
People who meditate a great deal are naturally more familiar with these visions than someone who has never called upon his or her guide.
The recognition of these spiritual teachers brings people into the company of a warm, loving creative power.
Through our guides, we become more acutely aware of the continuity of life and our identity as a soul.
Guides are complex entities, especially when they are master guides.
The awareness level of the soul determines to some extent the degree of advancement of the guide assigned to them.
Guides at the senior level of ability and above usually work with an entire group of souls in the spirit world and on Earth.
These guides have other entities who assist them.
From what I can see, every soul group usually has one or more rather new teachers in training.
As a result, some people may have more than one guide helping them.
Frequently, these names can be traced back to a specific past life a teacher spent with a student.
Some clients are unable to verbalize their guide’s name because the sound cannot be duplicated, even when they see them clearly while under hypnosis.
I tell these people it is much more important that they understand the purpose of why certain guides are assigned to them, rather than possessing their names.
A subject may simply use a general designation for their guide such as: director, advisor, instructor, or just “my friend.”
One has to be careful how the word friend is interpreted.
Usually, when a person in trance talks about a spiritual friend, they are referring to a soul-mate or peer group associate rather than a guide.
Entities who are our friends exist on levels not much higher or lower than ourselves.
These friends are able to offer mental encouragement from the spirit world while we are on Earth, and they can be with us as incarnated human companions while we walk the roads of life.
One of the most important aspects of my therapeutic work with clients is assisting them, on a conscious level, with appreciating the role their guides play in life.
These teacher entities edify all of us with their skillful instruction techniques.
Ideas we claim as our own may be generated by a concerned guide.
Guides also comfort us during the trying periods in our lives, especially when we are children in need of solace.
I remember a charming remark made by a subject after I asked when she began seeing her guide in this life.
“Oh, when I was daydreaming,” she said.
“I remember my guide was with me on my first day of school when I was really scared.
She sat on top of my desk to keep me company and then showed me the way to the bathroom when I was too afraid to ask the teacher.”
The concept of personalized spiritual beings goes far back in antiquity to our earliest origins as thinking human beings.
Anthropological studies at the sites of prehistoric people suggest their totemic symbols evoked individual protection.
Later, some 5,000 years ago as city-states arose, official deities became identified with state religions.
These gods were more remote and even generated fear.
Thus, personal and family deities assumed great importance in the day-to-day life of people for protection.
A personal soul deity served as a guardian angel to each person or family, and could be called upon for divine help during a crisis.
This tradition has been carried down into our cultures of today.
We have two examples at opposite ends of the United States.
Aumakua is a personal god to Hawaiians.
The Polynesians believe one’s ancestors can assume a personal god relationship to living family members.
In visions and dreams, Aumakua can either assist or reprimand an individual.
In northeastern America, the Iroquois believe a human’s own inner spiritual power is called Orenda, which is connected to a higher personal Orenda spirit.
This guardian is able to resist the powers of harm and evil directed at an individual.
The Zuni tribes of the Southwest have oral traditions in their mythology of god-like beings with personal existences.
They are called “the makers and holders of life paths” and are considered the caretakers of souls.
There are other cultures around the world which also believe someone other than God is watching over them to personally intercede on their behalf.
I think human beings have always needed anthropomorphic figures below a supreme God to portray the spiritual forces around them.
When people pray or meditate, they want to reach out to an entity with whom they are acquainted for inspiration.
It is easier to ask for aid from a figure which can be clearly identified in the human mind.
There is a lack of imagery with a supreme God which hinders a direct connection for many people.
Regardless of our diverse religious preferences and degrees of faith, people also feel if there is a supreme God, this divinity is too busy to bother about their individual problems.
People often express an unworthiness for a direct association with God.
As a result, the world’s major religions have used prophets who once lived on Earth to serve as our intermediaries with God.
Possibly because some of these prophets have been elevated to divine status themselves, they are not personal enough anymore.
I say this without diminishing the vital spiritual influence all the great prophets have had on their followers.
Millions of people derive benefit from the teachings of these powerful souls who incarnated on Earth as prophets in our historical past.
And yet, people know in their hearts—as they have always known— that someone, some personal entity i ndividual to them—is there, waiting to be reached.
I have the theory that guides appear to people who are very religious as figures of their faith.
There was a case on a national television show where the child of a devout Christian family suffered a near-death experience and said she saw Jesus.
When asked to draw with crayons what she saw, the little girl drew a featureless blue man standing within a halo of light.
My subjects have shown me how much they depend upon and make use of their spiritual guides during life.
I have come to believe we are their direct responsibility—not God’s.
These learned teachers remain with us over thousands of earth years to assist in our trials before, during, and after countless lives.
I notice that, unlike people walking around in a conscious state, subjects in trance do not blame God for their misfortunes in life.
More often than not, when we are in the soul state, it is our personal guide who takes the brunt of any dissatisfaction.
I am often asked if teacher-guides are matched to us or just picked at random.
This is a difficult question to answer.
Guides do appear to be assigned to us in the spirit world in an orderly fashion.
I have come to believe their individual teaching styles and management techniques support and beautifully integrate with our permanent soul identity.
It seems these empathetic guides are graded on how well they do in their assignments to affect positive change.
All guides have compassion for their students, but teaching approaches vary.
I find some guides constantly helping their students on Earth, while others demand their charges work out lessons with little overt encouragement.
The maturity of the soul is, of course, a factor.
Certainly graduate students get less help than freshmen.
Aside from the developmental level, I look at the intensity of individual desire as another consideration in the frequency of appearance and form of assistance one receives from his or her guide during a life.
As to gender assignments, I find no consistent correlation of male and female subjects to masculine or feminine appearing guides.
On the whole, people accept the gender portrayed by their guide as quite natural.
Some guides appear as mixed genders, which lends support to souls being truly androgynous.
One client told me, “My guide is sometimes Alexis or Alex, dropping in and out of both sexes, depending on my need for male or female advice.”
From what I can determine, the procedure for teacher selection is carefully managed in the spirit world.
Every human being has at least one senior, or a higher master guide, assigned to their soul since the soul was first created.
For want of a better term, I have called these student teachers junior guides.
Aspiring junior guides can anticipate the beginning of their training near the end of Level III, as they progress into the upper intermediate stages of development.
Actually, we begin our training as subordinate guides long before attaining Level IV.
In the lower stages of development we help others in life as friends and between lives assist our peer group associates with counseling.
Junior and senior teaching assignments appear to reflect the will of master guides, who form a kind of governing body, similar to a trusteeship, over the younger guides of the spirit world.
Only the more practiced ones.
I would imagine large groups of souls needing guides could become quite a responsibility for one advanced guide—even with an assistant.
So, if you are a senior in the blue light aura, class size has no relation to assignments, because you have the ability to handle large numbers of souls?
The guides you are calling seniors.
Well, who helps them?
I have heard them also called master teachers.
That’s not a bad description for them.
What energy color do they project to you?
It’s … purplish.
With advancing maturity this aura grows more dense, first to a muted midnight blue and finally to deep purple, representing the total integration of a Level VI ascended master.
They wouldn’t be teachers if they didn’t have a love of training and a desire to help us join them.
I must say, I have found souls very loyal to their guides.
That’s why—because they never give up on you.
What would you say is the most important attribute of any guide?
The ability to motivate you and instill courage.
My next case provides an example of the actions of a still-incarnating guide.
This guide is called Owa, and he represents the qualities of a devo- ted teacher reported by the last case.
Evidently, his early assignments as a guide involved looking after the subject in Case 18 in a direct fashion, and his methods apparently have not changed.
My client was stunned once she recognized her guide’s latest incarnation.
Case 18 was then a young girl, orphaned by a Roman raid against local dissidents.
In the opening scene of this past life, she spoke about working in a tavern as a virtual slave.
As a serving girl, she was constantly beaten by the owner and occasionally raped by Roman customers.
She died at age twenty-six of overwork, mistreatment, and despair.
This subject made the following statement from her subconscious mind about an old man in her village: “I worked day and night and felt numb with pain and humiliation.
He was the only person who was kind to me—who taught me to trust in myself—to have faith in something higher and finer than the cruel people around me.”
In this state she saw these people were all the same entity and was able to name this soul as Owa, her guide.
There were many lives when Owa did not appear, and sometimes his physical contact was only fleeting when he came to help her.
Tears came to her eyes and she cried out from the vision in her mind.
Your son is actually Owa?
What did you know the day he was born?
Why do you think Owa is here as your baby son Brandon?
Did you sense something unusual about your baby after you took him home?
Yes, it started at the hospital and this feeling never left me.
When I look into his eyes he … soothes me.
Sometimes I come home so worn out—so tired and beat down—I am short-tempered with him when the baby-sitter leaves.
But he is so patient with me.
I don’t even need to hold him.
The way he looks at me is … so wise.
I didn’t fully understand what this meant until now.
Now, I know!
And do you think it is all right we discovered your guide is with you as Brandon in this life?
Yes, if Owa didn’t want me to know that he decided to come into my life, I wouldn’t have come to see you—it wouldn’t have been on my mind.
This exceptional case represents the emotional intoxication a subject feels when an in-life contact is made with their guide.
Notice the role Owa chose did not infringe upon the most typical role usually taken by a soul-mate.
He did not come through as her spouse, and never has, in any of her past lives.
This client’s soulmate happens to be an old flame from high school.
Based upon all the information I was able to gather, Owa seems to have moved into the level of a junior guide in the last two-thousand years.
He may possibly graduate into the blue level of a senior guide before this client is qualified herself to rise from white to a yellow energy aura.
Regardless of the number of centuries this takes, Owa will remain as her guide, even though he may never incarnate again with her in a life.
Souls who develop relatively fast are gifted, but so are the guides who assist them.
It is not uncommon to find guides working in pairs with people on Earth, each with their own approaches to teaching.
In these cases one is dominant, although the more experienced senior guide may actually be less evident in day-to-day activities of their charges.
The senior guide may have acquired his or her own cluster of souls, which is still monitored by a master overseeing a number of soul groups.
Teams of guides do not interfere with each other in or out of the spirit world.
I have a close friend whose guides illustrate how two teachers working together complement each other.
Using this individual’s case is appropriate, because I have observed the way this person’s two guides interact in various life circumstances.
My friend’s junior guide appears in the form of a kindly, nurturing Native American medicine woman called Quan.
Dressed simply in a deerskin sheath, her long hair pulled back, Quan’s soft face is bathed in vivid light during her appearances.
When she is called, Quan provides a vehicle for insight and understanding events and the individuals associated with those events, which are troubling to my friend.
Quan’s desire to lighten the load of the rather difficult life my friend has chosen is tempered by a challenging male figure called Giles.
Giles is clearly a senior guide who may be close to being a master in the spirit world.
In this capacity, he does not appear nearly as often as Quan.
When Giles does come into my friend’s higher consciousness, he does so abruptly.
Here is a sample of how a senior guide operates differently from one of junior status.
When you are in deep reflection over a serious problem, how does Giles come to you?
You mean he appears first as a blue energy form?
Yes … to hide himself a bit—he likes to be secretive, but it doesn’t last long.
I don’t know—to make sure I really want him, I guess.
Well, when he shows himself, what does Giles look like to you?
An Irish Leprechaun.
Oh, then he is a small man?
An elf figure—tangled hair all over his wrinkled face—he looks a mess and moves constantly in all directions.
Why does he do that?
Giles is a slippery character—impatient, too—he frowns a lot while he paces back and forth in front of me with his arms clasped in back of him.
And how would you interpret this behavior?
Giles is not dignified like some … but he is very clever … crafty.
Could you be more specific as to how this conduct relates to you?
Giles has made me look upon my lives as a chess game with the Earth as the board.
Certain moves bring certain results and there are no easy solutions.
I plan, and then things go wrong during the game in my life.
I sometimes think he lays traps for me to work through on the board.
… More afterward … here … but, he makes me work so damn hard on Earth.
Could you get rid of him and just work with Quan?
So, we don’t get to choose our guides?
The embodiments of Native Americans who once lived in North America make powerful spiritual guides for those of us who have followed them to live in this land.
What do you like most about Giles’ teaching methods?
And you feel this coaching on Earth, even when you and I are not working together?
Yes, when I meditate and go inside myself … or during my dreams.
And Giles comes when you want him?
No … although it seems as though I have been with him forever.
Quan does come to me more.
I can’t just grab hold of Giles in any situation I want, unless what I have going on is really serious.
He is elusive.
Sum up your feelings about Quan and Giles for me.
These two guides are a cooperating team of instructors, which is standard procedure for those people who have two guides.
In this case, Giles enjoys teaching karmic lessons by the Socratic method.
Providing no clues in advance, he makes sure problem-solving on major issues is never easy for my friend.
Quan, on the other hand, provides comfort and gentle encouragement.
When my friend comes to me for a hypnosis session, I am aware that Quan remains in the background when Giles is on-board and active.
Giles is a caring guide, as all guides are, but without a trace of indulgence.
Adversity is allowed to build to the absolute limits of my friend’s ability to cope before solutions suddenly begin to unfold.
To be honest, I see Giles as a wicked taskmaster.
This view is not really shared by my friend, who is grateful for the challenges offered by this complex teacher.
These dedicated higher entities give me the impression of having attitudinal swings toward me from one session to the next, and even within the same session with a client.
They can be cooperative or obstructive, tolerant or disobliging, evasive or revealing, or just flat out unconcerned with anything I do with a subject.
I find them enigmatic because they are unpredictable in their relations with me as a facilitator.
Early in this century, it was common for mediums working with people in hypnosis to call any discarnate entity in the room a “control,” because they acted as the director of communications on the spiritual side for the subject.
It was recognized that a spiritual control had energy patterns which were in emotional, intellectual, and spiritual attunement with the subject.
The importance of a harmonious energy pattern between facilitator and these entities was also known.
If a control is blocking my investigations with a client, I search for the reason why this is happening.
With some blocking guides I must fight for every scrap of information, while others give me a great deal of latitude in a session.
I never forget that guides have every right to block my approach to problems with souls under their care.
After all, I have their people as my subjects for only a short while.
Frankly, I would much rather have no contact with a client’s guide than work with one who might assist me at one point and then block the rhythm of memory in the next portion of a session.
I believe a guide’s motivation for blocking information goes far beyond resisting the immediate psychological direction a therapy session is taking.
I am constantly searching for new data on the spirit world.
A guide who lends support to a free flow of past life memories from one of my subjects may balk at my far-reaching questions about life on other planets, the structure of the spirit world, or creation itself.
This is why I am only able to collect these spiritual secrets in fragments from a large body of client information reflecting the discretion of many guides.
I also feel that I am receiving assistance from my own spiritual guide during communications with subjects and their guides.
This is usually temporary.
At any time, people are capable of believing their guides are too difficult and not working in their best interests, or just not paying enough attention to them.
A subject once told me that he had tried for a long time to be assigned another guide.
The man told me his desire for a change in guides was not honored.
I observed that he spent considerable time alone, without much group interaction after his last two lives, because he refused to deal with his issues.
He projected anger toward his guide for not rescuing him from bad situations.
Our teachers really don’t get perturbed with us to the point of alienation, but I notice they have a way of making themselves scarce when disgruntled students avoid real problem-solving.
Guides only want the best for us and sometimes this means they must watch us endure much pain to reach certain objectives.
Guides cannot assist in our progress until we are ready to make the necessary changes in order to take full advantage of life’s opportunities.
Typically, this concern does not last.
We may feel chagrined over having to explain to our guides why goals were not attained, but they understand.
They want us to interpret our past lives so we will have the benefit of assisting in the analysis of mistakes.
My clients express all sorts of sentiments about their guides, but fear is not among them.
On the contrary, people are more worried about being abandoned by spiritual advisors during difficult periods in their lives.
Our relationship with guides is one of students and teachers rather than defendants and judges.
Guides give us an affirmation of Self in a crowded world.
People want to know if their guides always come whenever they call for help.
Guides are not consistent in the manner in which they choose to assist us, because they carefully evaluate how badly they are needed.
I am also asked if hypnosis is the best way to get in contact with one’s guide.
Naturally, I lean toward hypnosis, because I know how potent and effective this medium can be to obtain detailed spiritual information.
However, hypnosis by a trained facilitator is not convenient on a daily basis, where meditation, prayer, and perhaps channeling with another person would be.
Regardless of the method used, we all have the capacity to send out far-reaching thought waves from our higher consciousness.
Every person’s thoughts represent a mental fingerprint to guides marking who and where we are.
During our lives, especially in periods of great stress, most people feel the presence of someone watching out for them.
We may not be able to describe this power, but it is there nonetheless.
Reaching our soul is the first step on the ladder of finding our higher power.
All lines of mental communication we use to reach a God-head are monitored by our guides on this step.
They, too, have their guides further up the ladder.
It is essential for people to have faith that a prayer for help will be answered by their own higher power.
This is why guides are vitally important to our spiritual and temporal lives.
If we are relaxed and in a state of concentrated focus, an inner voice speaks to us.
And, even if we didn’t initiate the message, we should trust what we hear.
National surveys by psychologists indicate one person in ten admits to hearing voices which are frequently positive and instructional in nature.
It is a relief for many people to learn their inner voices are not the hallucinations associated with the mentally ill.
Rather than something to be worried about, an inner voice is like having your own resident counselor on call.
More often than not, these voices are those of our guides.
Guides assigned to different souls do work together relaying urgent mental messages for each other.
People unable to help themselves in critical situations may find counselors, friends, and even strangers coming to their aid at just the right moment.
The inner strength which comes to us in our daily lives does not arrive as much by a visual picture of actually seeing our guides, as from the feelings and emotions which convince us we are not alone.
People who listen and encourage their inner voice through quiet contemplation say they feel a personal connection with an energy beyond themselves which offers support and reassurance.
If you prefer to call this internal guidance system inspiration or intuition, that is fine, because the system which aids us is an aspect of ourselves as well as higher powers.
During troublesome times in our lives, we have the tendency to ask for guidance to immediately set things right.
When they are in trance, my clients see that their guides don’t help them solve all their problems at once, rather they illuminate pathways by the use of clues.
This is one reason why I am cautious about client-blocking during hypnosis.
Insight is best revealed with a controlled pace relative to each person.
A concerned teacher may not want all aspects of a problem uncovered at a given point in time for his or her student.
We vary in our ability to handle revelations.
When asking for help from your higher spiritual power, I think it is best not to demand immediate change.
Our success in life is predicated on planning, but we do have alternative paths to choose from to reach certain goals.
When seeking guidance, I suggest requesting help with just the next step in your life.
When you do this, be prepared for unexpected possibilities.
Have the faith and humility to open yourself up to a variety of paths toward solutions.
After death we do not experience sadness as souls with the same emo- tional definition as grief felt in physical form.
Yet, as we have already seen, souls are not detached beings without feelings.
I have learned those powers who watch over us also feel what I call a spiritual sorrow when they see us making poor choices in life and going through pain.
Certainly, our soul-mates and peers suffer distress when we are tormented, but so do our guides.
Guides may not show sorrow in orientation conferences and during soul group discussions between lives, but they keenly feel their responsibilities toward us as teachers.
I have never found a person who is a living grade VI, or master guide, as a subject.
I suspect we don’t have a whole lot of these advanced souls on Earth at any one time.
Most Level VI’s are much too involved with planning and directing from the spirit world to incarnate any longer.
From the reports of the Level V’s I have had, it would seem the Level VI has no new lessons to learn, but I have a hunch a still-incarnating soul at Level V may not know all the esoteric tasks involved with master level entities.
Once in a while during a session with a more advanced soul, I hear references to an even higher level of soul than Level VI.
These entities, to whom even the masters report, are in the darkest purple range of energy.
These superior beings must be getting close to the creator.
I am told these shadowy figures are elusive, but highly venerated beings in the spirit world.
The average client doesn’t know if spiritual guides should be placed in a less than divine category, or considered lesser gods because of their advancement.
There is nothing wrong with any spiritual concept, as long as it provides comfort, is uplifting, and makes sense to each individual.
Although some of my clients have the tendency to consider guides godlike— they are not God.
In my opinion, guides are no more or less divine than we are, which is why they are seen as personal beings.
In all my cases God is never seen.
People in hypnosis say they feel the presence of a supreme power directing the spirit world, but they are uncomfortable using the word “God” to describe a creator.
Perhaps the philosopher Spinoza said it best with these words: “God is not He who is, but That which is.”
Every soul has a spiritual higher power linked to its existence.
This intelligent energy is universal in scope and so we all share in divine status.
If our soul reflects a small portion of the oversoul we call God, then our guides provide the mirror by which we are able to see ourselves connected to this creator.
I believe almost three-quarters of all souls who inhabit human bodies on Earth today are still in the early stages of development.
I know this is a grossly discouraging statement because it means most of our human population is operating at the lower end of their training.
On the other hand, when I consider a world population beset by so much negative cross-cultural misunderstanding and violence, I am not inclined to change my opinion about the high percentage of lower level souls on Earth.
However, I do think each century brings improvement of awareness in all humans.
Over a number of years, I have maintained a statistical count of client soul levels in my case files.
Undoubtedly, the figures are weighted to some extent at the lower levels because these subjects were not selected at random.
For those who are curious, the percentages by soul level of all my cases are as followS:
Projecting these figures into a world population of five billion souls would be unreliable, using my small sample.
Nevertheless, I see the possibility we may have only a few hundred thousand people on Earth at Level V.
My subjects state that souls end their incarnations on Earth when they reach full maturity.
What is significant about the high percentage of souls in the early stages of development is our rapidly multiplying population and the urgency babies have for available souls.
We are increasing by 260,000 children per day.
This human necessity for souls means they must normally be drawn from a spiritual pool of less advanced entities who require more incarnations to progress and are, therefore, more available to return to another life.
I am sensitive to the feelings of clients whom I know to be in the early stages of development.
I cannot count the number of times a new client has come into my office and said, “I know I am an old soul, but I seem to have problems coping with life.”
We all want to be advanced souls because most people hate to be considered a beginner in anything.
Every case is unique.
There are many variables within each soul’s character, individual development rate, and the qualities of the guides assigned to them.
I see my task as offering interpretations of what subjects report to me about the progression of their souls.
I have had many cases where a client has been incarnating for up to 30,000 years on Earth and is still in the lower levels of I and II.
The reverse is also true with a few people, although rapid acceleration in spiritual development is uncommon.
As with any educational model, students find certain lessons more difficult than others.
One of my clients has not been able to conquer envy for 850 years in numerous lives, but she did not have too much trouble overcoming bigotry by the end of this same period.
Another has spent nearly 1700 years off-and-on seeking some sort of authoritative power over others.
The next case represents an absolute beginner soul.
This novice shows no evidence of having a spiritual group assignment as yet, because she has lived too few past lives.
In her first life she was killed in 1260 ad in Northern Syria by a Mongol invasion.
Shabez, now that you have died and returned to the spirit world, tell me what you feel?
Who made this mistake?
But you did agree to come into the body of Shabez?
Didn’t you learn anything from this life?
I started to learn to love … yes, that was wonderful … my brother … parents … but it was so short …
Did anything good come out of this life?
My brother Ahmed … to be with him …
Is Ahmed in your present life?
Do you see Ahmed on your return to the spirit world after dying as Shabez?
Yes, our leader brings us together here … where we stay.
Does Ahmed emit the same energy color as yourself or are there differences?
We … are all white.
Describe what you do here.
While our leader comes and goes, Ahmed and I … just work together.
Doing what?
I don’t know … I was just here … with thought …
Do you remember during your own creation when you first began to think as an intelligent being?
I realized … I existed … but I didn’t know myself as myself until I was moved into this quiet place alone with Ahmed.
Are you saying your individual identity came more into focus when you began interacting with another soul entity besides your guide?
Yes, with Ahmed.
Warm … nurturing … my mind opening … she was with me then.
I don’t mean him … someone was around me with the presence of a … mother and father … mostly mother …
What presence?
I don’t know … a soft light … changing features … I can’t grasp it … loving messages … encouragement …
This was at the time of your creation as a soul?
Yes … it’s all hazy … there were others … helpers … when I was born.
What else can you tell me about the place of your creation?
Others … love me … in a nursery … then we left … and I was with Ahmed and our leader.
Who actually created you and Ahmed?
I have learned there seems to be a kind of spirit world maternity ward for newborn souls.
One client told me, “This place is where infantile light is arranged in a honeycomb fashion as unhatched eggs, ready to be used.”
My conjecture is these creation centers described by Shabez have the same function.
Case 20 has some obvious traits of the immature soul.
The subject is a sixty-seven-year-old woman who has had a lifetime of getting into disastrous ruts.
She does not demonstrate a generosity of spirit toward others, nor does she take much personal responsibility for her actions.
This client came to me searching for answers as to why life had “cheated me out of happiness.”
In our session we learned Ahmed was her first husband, Bill.
She left him long ago for another man, whom she also divorced, because of her inability to bond with people.
She does not feel close to any of her children.
The beginner soul may live a number of lives in a state of confusion and ineffectiveness, influenced by an Earth curriculum which is different from the coherence and supportive harmony of the spirit world.
Less developed souls are inclined to surrender their will to the controlling aspects of human society, with a socio-economic structure which causes a large proportion of people to be subordinate to others.
The inexperienced soul tends to be stifled by a lack of independent thinking.
They also lean towards being self-centered and don’t easily accept others for who they are.
It is not my intention to paint a totally bleak portrait of souls who comprise so much of our world population—if my estimates of the high numbers of this category of soul are accurate.
Lower level souls are also able to lead lives which have many positive elements.
Otherwise, no one would advance.
No stigma should be attached to these souls, since every soul was once a beginner.
If we become angry, resentful, and confused by our life situations, this does not necessarily mean we possess an underdeveloped spirit.
Soul development is a complex matter where we all progress by degrees in a variety of areas in an uneven manner.
The important thing is to recognize our faults, avoid self-denial, and have the courage and self-sufficiency to make constant adjustments in our lives.
One of the clear indications that souls are coming out of novice status is when they leave their spiritual existence of relative isolation.
They are removed from small family cocoons with other novices and placed in a larger group of beginner souls.
At this stage they are less dependent upon close supervision and special nurturing from their guides.
Generally, I find this important spiritual event has occurred by the end of a fifth life on Earth, regardless of the relative length of time the novice soul was in semi-isolation.
Some of the entities of these new spiritual groups are the souls of relatives and friends with whom the young soul was associated in their few past lives on Earth.
What is especially significant about the formation of a new cluster group is that other peer group members are also newer souls who find themselves together for the first time.
Case 21 will offer a more detailed account of spiritual group dynamics and how members impact on each other.
The capacity of souls to learn certain lessons may be stronger or weaker between one another depending upon inclination, motivation, and prior incarnation experience.
Cluster groups are carefully designed to give peer support through a sensitivity of identity traits between all members.
This cohesiveness is far beyond what we know on Earth.
Although the next case is presented from the perspective of one group member, his superconscious mind provides an objectivity into the process of what goes on in groups.
My subject will describe a grandiose, male-oriented spiritual group.
The raucous entities of this group are linked by exhibitionism which could be labeled narcissistic.
The common approaches these souls use in finding personal value is one indication why they are working together.
The extravagant behavior modes of these souls is offset, to some extent, by their spiritual prescience.
Since the complete truth is known by all group members about each other in a telepathic world, humor is indispensible.
Some readers may find it hard to accept that souls do joke with each other about their failings, but humor is the basis upon which self-deception and hypocrisy are exposed.
Ego defenses are so well understood by everyone in spiritual groups that evidence of a mastery of oneself among peers is a strong incentive for change.
Spiritual “therapy” occurs because of honest peer feedback, mutual trust, and the desire to advance with others over eons of time.
Souls can hurt, and they need caring entities around them.
The curative power of spiritual group interaction is quite remarkable.
Soul members network by the use of criticism and acclaim as each strives toward common goals.
Some of the best help I am able to give my clients comes from information I receive about their soul group.
Spiritual groups are a primary means of soul instruction.
Learning appears to come as much from one’s peers as from the skill of guides who monitor these groups.
In the case which follows, my client has finished reliving his last past life as a Dutch artist living in Amsterdam.
He died of pneumonia at a young age in 1841, about the time he was gaining recognition for his painting.
We have just rejoined his spiritual group when my subject bursts out laughing.
Why are you laughing?
I’m back with my friends and they are giving me a hard time.
Because I’m wearing my fancy buckled shoes and the bright green velvet jacket—with yellow piping down the sides—I’m flashing them my big floppy painter’s hat.
They are kidding you about projecting yourself wearing these clothes?
What happens next?
You and your friends don’t think it is important to take life on Earth seriously?
Look, Earth is one big stage play—we all know that.
And your group is united in this feeling?
Sure, we see ourselves as actors in a gigantic stage production.
Well, we work with … some others … but there are five of us who are close.
By what name do they call you?
L … Lemm—no that’s not right—it’s Allum … that’s me.
All right, Allum, tell me about your close friends.
Norcross … he is the funniest … at least he is the most boisterous.
Is Norcross the leader of your group?
Oh, as being rather unscrupulous—but not dangerous.
Who is the quietest and most unassuming member of your group?
How did you guess—it’s Vilo.
Does this attribute make Vilo the least effective contributing member of your group?
Give me an example.
Vilo reminds me of my debt to them—that the garden triggered my painting—to see life as an artist … and what I didn’t do with my talent.
Does Vilo convey any other thoughts to you about this?
Do you have respect for Vilo’s opinions?
Yes, we know he is our conscience.
So, what do you say to him?
I say, “Innkeeper, mind your own business—you were having fun, too.”
Vilo was an innkeeper?
Do you feel this was wrong of Vilo?
Yes, we all know Vilo is progressing—damn!
Does it bother you that Vilo may be advancing faster than the rest of you?
Yes … we have had such fun …
What will happen to Vilo?
He is going to leave us soon—we all know that—to have associations with the others who have also gone.
How many souls have left your original group, Allum?
Name the others of your immediate group for me besides Vilo and Norcross.
Dubri and Trinian—now those two know how to have a good time!
What is the most obvious identifying characteristic of your group?
Dubri just came off a wild life as a sea captain.
Norcross was a free-wheeling trading merchant.
We live life to its fullest because we are talented at taking what life has to offer.
I’m hearing a lot of self-gratification here, Allum.
What’s the story on Trinian’s last life?
And what does Trinian’s soul mentally project to you in self-defense?
He tells us he gave solace to many people.
What do you, Norcross and Dubri, tell him in response?
Humph—that Trinian picked a large city with a rich cathedral— spilling a ton of money into Trinian’s fat pockets.
And what do you tell Trinian yourself?
Oh, I’m attracted to the fancy robes he wore—bright red—the finest of cloth—his Bishop’s ring which he loved—and all the gold and silver around.
I also mention his desire to bask in adulation from his flock.
Trinian can hide nothing from us—he wanted an easy, cushy life where he was well-fed.
Does he try to explain his motivations for choosing this life?
Does Trinian offer any excuses to the group for his conduct?
Oh, the usual.
He got carried away with the girl’s need for him—she had no family—he was lonely in his choice of a celibate church life.
He says he was trying to get away from the customary lives we all choose by going into the church— that he fell in love with the girl.
And how do you, Norcross and Dubri, feel about Trinian now?
Oh, we are just teasing him … after all…
Your amusement sounds as if you are scornful over what may have been Trinian’s good intentions.
You’re right … and we all know that … but, you see … Norcross, Dubri, and I … well, we don’t want to lose him from the group, too …
What does Vilo say about Trinian?
He defends Trinian’s original good intentions and tells him that he fell into a trap of self-gratification during this life in the church.
Trinian wants too much admiration and attention.
Hey, Vilo can be pretty smug.
Let me tell you, his problem is conceit and Dubri tells him that in no uncertain terms.
And does Vilo deny it?
No, he doesn’t … he says at least he is working on it.
Who among you is the most sensitive to criticism?
Oh, I guess it would be Norcross, but it’s hard for all of us to accept our faults.
We are sensitive about it—but not morbid.
There is great understanding here among us.
I wanted to give artistic pleasure to people and grow through the meaning of art.
My original purpose was pushed aside.
How does Dubri fit into your group with his faults?
Was he cruel?
No, just hard.
He was respected as a captain.
Dubri was merciless against his opponents in sea battles, but he took care of his own men.
You have told me that Vilo assisted people who were in need on the road, but you haven’t said much about the positive side of your lives.
Is anyone in your group given any gold stars for unselfish acts?
There is something else about Dubri …
What is that?
When this incident is discussed in your group, how do you all respond to Dubri?
Do you get any strokes from the group for your last life?
Every one of my clients has special attachments to their soul group, regardless of character makeup.
People tend to think of souls in the free state as being without human deficiencies.
Actually, I think there are many similarities between groups of souls close to each other and human family systems.
For instance, I see Norcross as the rebellious scapegoat for this group of souls, while he and Allum are the inventory takers for everyone’s shortcomings.
Allum said Norcross is usually the first to openly scrutinize any rationalizations or self-serving justifications of past life failures offered by the other members.
He appears to have the least self-doubt and emotional investment over standards of conduct.
This may define his own insecurity, because Norcross is probably fighting the hardest to keep up with the advancing group.
I suspect Allum himself could be the group’s mascot , with all his clowning around, preening, and making light of serious issues.
Some souls in spiritual groups do seem to me to be more fragile and protected than other group members.
Vilo’s conduct demonstrates he is the current hero , with his drive for excellence.
Just as in human family systems, the roles of spiritual group members can be switched around, but I was told Vilo’s kinetic energy is turning pink, signaling his growth into Level II.
I attach human labels on ethereal spirits because, after all, souls who come to Earth do show themselves through human characteristics.
However, I don’t see hatred, suspicion, and disrespect in soul groups.
In a climate of compassion, there are no power struggles for control among these peer groups whose members are unable to manipulate each other or keep secrets.
Souls distrust themselves, not each other.
I do see fortitude, desire, and the will to keep trying in their new physical lives.
In an effort to confirm some of my observations about the social dynamics among spiritual group members in this case, I ask Allum a few more questions.
Allum, do you believe your criticism of each other is always constructive?
Is any member of your soul group ever made to feel shame or guilt about a past life?
Those are … human weapons … and too narrow for what we feel.
Do you have any regrets for your conduct in any past life?
And what do you do about this knowledge?
Talk among ourselves … and try to make amends the next time.
From what you told me earlier, I had the idea that you, Nor-cross, and Dubri might be releasing some pent-up feelings over your own shortcomings by dumping on each other.
I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but I just wondered if all this flamboyance exhibited by your group might indicate underlying feelings of unworthiness?
So, while you have self-doubts about yourselves, it’s okay to make cynical remarks about each other’s motivations?
Now Allum, as long as we are discussing how your group members relate to each other, I want you to describe the spiritual energy by which you all are assisted in this process.
I’m not sure I can tell you …
Ah … you mean from the cones?
Well, the cones do assist us.
It’s shaped to go around us, you know.
Are you sure this isn’t the shower of healing you experienced right after your return to the spirit world?
The top funnels energy down as a waterfall in a spreading circle around all of us and allows us to really concentrate on our mental sameness as a group.
And what do you feel when you are under the cone?
We can feel all our thoughts being expanded … then drawn up … and returned back … with more knowledge added.
Does this intelligent energy help your unity as a group in terms of more focused thinking?
Is the cone always available?
It is there when we need it.
Who operates the cone?
Those who watch over us.
Your guide?
What do you mean?
We think of him as a circus master—a stage manager—of our group.
Do you think there is one specific reason for the absences of Shato?
I get the picture of a spiritual Merlin.
An Oriental Merlin, if you will.
Very inscrutable sometimes.
He loves making a grand entrance in full costume, especially when we are about to choose another life.
He knows how much we appreciate his act.
With all this stage management, I am curious if Shato has much emotional connection to your group as a serious guide.
Do you see Shato as a consultant who comes only once in a while to observe, or as an active supervisor?
Give me an example of a major problem with your group.
So Shato’s instruction is serious, but he knows you all like to have fun along the way?
From what you have told me, I have the impression that your spiritual group is run as a kind of workshop directed by your guide.
Yes, he builds up our morale and keeps us going.
Unlike educational classrooms or therapy groups on Earth, I have learned teacher-counselors in the spirit world are not confined as group activity leaders on a continuous basis.
Although Shato and his students are a colorful family of souls, there is much here that is typical of all cluster groups.
A guide’s leadership is more parental than dictatorial.
In this case, Shato is a directive counselor while not being possessive, nor does he pose a threat to the group.
There is warm acceptance of these young souls by this empathic guide, who seems to cater to their masculine inclinations.
I will close this case with a few final questions about the group as a spiritual unit.
Why is your group so male-oriented on Earth?
Allum, I would like to end our conversation about your spiritual associations by asking you what you know about the origin of your group.
I … can’t tell you … we just came together at one time.
No, below the source … the higher ones …
Shato, or other guides like him?
No, higher, I think … the planners … I don’t know any more.
Do you ever get new members?
Is this because a new member might have trouble assimilating with the rest of you?
During your discussions about these past lives together, does your group believe it contributes to the betterment of human society?
And when your spiritual group has finished discussing what is necessary to further your aims, do you look forward to a new life?
Herein lies the key to understanding the formation of soul groups.
I have learned that many spiritual clusters have sub-groups made up of entities whose identities are linked by similar issues blocking their advancement.
Even so, these souls do have differences in strengths and weaknesses.
Each group member contributes their best attributes toward advancing the goals of others in the family.
I do not want to leave the impression from case 21 that the few remaining souls in this inner circle of close friends represent the behavior traits of everyone in the original cluster.
When a primary group of, say fifteen or twenty souls is formed, there are marked similarities in talent and interests.
But a support group is also designed to have differences in disposition, feelings, and reactions.
These differences give a group balance.
However, if an entire group displays a strong tendency toward flamboyance or daring, the most cautious member would appear less so to another group of souls.
There is no question that the souls in Case 21 are in for a long development period.
Yet they do contribute to the vitality of Earth.
Subsequent questioning of this subject revealed the paths of these souls continue to cross in the twentieth century.
The fact that the closely-knit souls in this case were so male-oriented in their physical lives does not take away from their ability to associate with young souls with predominantly female preferences.
Cluster groups are gender-mixed.
As I have mentioned, truly advanced souls have balanced gender preferences in their physical life choices.
The desire for expression of self-identity is an important motivating factor for souls choosing to come to Earth to learn practical lessons.
Sometimes a reason for discomfort with the lower level soul is the discrepancy in perception of Self in their free soul state, compared to how they act in human bodies.
Souls can get confused with who they are in life.
Case 21 did not seem to exhibit any conflict in this area, but I question the rate of growth achieved by Allum in recent past lives.
However, the basic experience of living a life may compensate, to some extent, for the lack of insight gained from that life.
Our shortcomings and moral conflicts are recognized as faults far more in the spirit world than on Earth.
We have seen how the nuances of decision-making are dissected and analyzed in spiritual groups.
Cluster members have worked together for such a long time in earth years that entities become accountable to each other and the group as a whole.
This fosters a great sense of belonging in all spiritual groups, and can give the appearance of thought barriers between clusters, especially with souls in the lower levels.
The social structure of soul groups is not the same as groups of people on Earth.
Although there is some evidence of paired friendships, I don’t hear about cliques, stars of attraction, or isolated souls within clusters.
I am told souls do spend time alone in the silence of personal reflection when attached to a group.
Souls are intimate entities in their family relationships on Earth and engagement in group community life in the spirit world.
And yet, souls do learn much from solitude.
I understand from my white-light subjects that souls at the beginning levels are frequently separated from their groups to individually work on simple energy projects.
It was described as being “multi-dimensional, colorful, and holographic” in nature.
He said, “We have to learn to intensify our energy to bring the diffused and jumbled into focus to give it some kind of basic shape.”
Another subject added, “These tests give the Watchers information about our imagination, creativity, and ingenuity, and they offer us encouragement rather than being judgmental.”
Souls on all levels engage in another important activity when they are alone.
They are expected to spend time mentally concentrating on helping those on Earth whom they have known and cared about.
Here they enter an “interdimensional field of floating, silvery-blue energy,” and project outward to geographical area of their choosing.
I am told this is a mental exercise in “holding and releasing positive vibrational energy to create a territory.”
This means souls ride on their thought waves to specific people, buildings, or a given area of land in an attempt to comfort or effect change.
ONCE our souls advance past Level II into the intermediate ranges of development, group cluster activity is considerably reduced.
This does not mean we return to the kind of isolation we saw with the novice soul.
Souls evolving into the middle development levels have less association with primary groups because they have acquired the maturity and experience for operating more independently.
These souls are also reducing the number of their incarnations.
Within Levels III and IV we are at last ready for more serious responsibilities.
The relationship we have with our guides now changes from teacher-student to one of colleagues working together.
Since our old guides have acquired new student groups, it is now our turn to develop teaching skills which will eventually qualify us for the responsibilities of being a guide to someone else.
For instance, some Level IV souls begin targeting themselves toward primary cluster teacher training while still in Level III, while other subjects who are clearly Level IV’s find they are unsuited to be effective guides.
Despite their high standards of morality and conduct, entities who have reached the intermediate levels of maturity are modest about their achievements.
Naturally, each case is different, but I notice more composure with clients in this stage and above.
I see trust rather than suspicion toward the motives of others on both a conscious and subconscious level.
These people demonstrate a forward-looking attitude of faith and confidence for the future of humanity, which encourages those around them.
My questions to the more mature soul are directed to esoteric ideas of purpose and creation.
I admit to taking advantage of the higher knowledge possessed by these souls for the sort of spiritual information others lack.
There have been clients who have told me they felt I pushed them rather hard in drawing out their spiritual memories and I know they are right.
The more advanced souls of this world possess remarkable comprehension of a universal life plan.
I want to learn as much as possible from them.
My next case falls into the upper portion of Level III development, radiating a yellow energy devoid of any reddish tones.
This client was a small, nondescript man nearly fifty years old.
His demeanor was quietly courteous towards me when we met, and I thought him a trifle solemn.
I felt his unassuming detachment was somewhat studied, almost as a cover for stronger emotions.
The most striking feature about him was his dark, morose eyes, which grew more intense as he began to talk about himself in a direct and persuasive manner.
He told me he worked for a charitable organization dispensing food to the homeless, and that he had once been a journalist.
This client had traveled quite some distance to discuss with me his concern over a decline in enthusiasm for his work.
He said he was tired and wanted to spend the rest of his life quietly alone.
His first session involved a review of the highlights of many past lives so we could better evaluate a proper course for the remainder of his current life.
I began by regressing the subject rapidly through a series of early lives starting from his first life as a Cro-Magnon man in a Stone Age culture some 30,000 years ago.
As we moved forward in time, I noted a consistency of lone-wolf behavior patterns as opposed to normal tribal integration.
From about 3,000 bc to 500 bc, my client lived a number of lives in the Middle East during the rise of the early city states in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Egyptian cultures.
Nevertheless, even in lives as a woman, this subject often avoided family ties, including having no children.
As a man, he showed a preference for nomadism.
By the time we reached a life in Europe during the Dark Ages, I was becoming accustomed to a rebellious soul resisting tyrannical societies.
During his lives, my subject worked to uplift people from fear, while remaining non-aligned to opposing factions.
Suffering hardships and many setbacks, he continued as a wanderer with an obsession for freedom of movement.
Some lives were not too productive, but during the twelfth century I found him in Central America in the body of an Aztec, organizing a band of Indians against the oppressions of a high priest.
He was killed in this setting as a virtual outcast, while promoting non-violent relations between tribes who were traditional enemies.
In the fourteenth century, this soul was a European chronicler, traveling the silk road to Cathay to gain understanding of the peoples of Asia.
Always facile with languages , my client died in Asia as an old man happily living in a peasant village.
In Japan, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he was a member of the clan of the Bleeding Crane.
These men were respected, independent Samurai mercenaries.
At the end of this life my subject was living in seclusion from the ruling Tokugawa shoguns, because he had advised their weaker opponents on battle strategy.
Frequently the outsider, always an explorer searching for truth across many lands, this soul continued to seek a rational meaning to life while giving aid to those he met along the way.
I was surprised when he popped up as the wife of an American farmer on the frontier in the nineteenth century.
The farmer died soon after their marriage.
I learned my subject had deliberately incarnated to be a widow with children, tied to a piece of property, as an exercise in the loss of mobility.
Since this soul is approaching Level IV, I would not have been surprised if his first appearance on Earth had gone back 70,000 years rather than half that amount of time.
However, as I have mentioned, it is not an absolute prerequisite that souls have hundreds of physical lives in order to advance.
I once had a client who entered into a Level III state of awareness after only 4,000 years—an outstanding performance.
I talked to my client about his current life and his customary methods of learning in previous lives.
He explained he had never been married, and that social non-alignments worked best for him.
I suggested a few alternatives for his consideration.
Primarily, I felt his lack of intimacy with people in too many lives was obstructing his progress.
When this session ended, he was anxious that we explore his mind further for perceptions about the spirit world in another session.
Upon his arrival the next day, I placed him in a superconscious state and we went back to work.
By what name are you called in the spirit world?
Nenthum, do you have spirits around you right now or are you alone?
I am with two of my long-time companions.
What are their names?
Raoul and Senji.
We were … but now the three of us work … more by ourselves.
What are the three of you doing at this moment?
We are discussing the best ways to help each other during our incarnations.
Tell me what you do for each other.
How does she assist you?
To … see my lack of a sense of belonging.
Give me an example of Senji’s actions to assist you with this issue.
Well, she was my wife in Japan after my days as a warrior were over.
Raoul likes to pair with Senji and I am usually alone.
I help him with patience and he helps me with my tendency to avoid community life.
Are you always two males and a female in your incarnations on Earth?
No, we can change—and do—but this is comfortable for us.
Why are the three of you working independently from the rest of your spiritual group?
Oh, we see them here … some have not gone forward with us … a few others are further ahead of us in their tasks.
Do you have a guide or teacher?
She is Idis.
What is the main area of conflict between the two of you?
She doesn’t reincarnate much, and I tell her she should have more direct exposure to current conditions on Earth.
Are you mentally in tune with Idis to such an extent that you know all about her background training as a guide?
Are guides able to screen their thoughts so you can’t read their minds completely?
Yes, the older ones get proficient at that—knowing how to filter things we don’t need to know because this knowledge would confuse us.
Will you learn to filter images?
I already have … a little.
This must be why I have had many people tell me they have not been given definitive answers by their guides to all their questions.
Aside from her teaching techniques, are you fond of Idis in terms of her identity?
Yes … I just wish she would agree to come with me … once.
Oh, you would like to actually have an Earth incarnation with her?
I have told her we might relate better here if she would consent to come to Earth sometime and mate with me.
And what does Idis say to that suggestion?
She laughs and says she will think about it—if I can prove to her that it would be productive.
At this junction I ask Nenthum how long Idis has been associated with him and learn she was assigned these three entities when they moved into Level III.
Nenthum, Raoul, and Senji are also under the tutelage of a beloved older master guide who has been with them since the beginning of their existence.
It would be inaccurate to assume that more advanced spirits lead lonely spiritual lives.
This subject told me he was in contact with many souls.
Raoul and Senji were simply his closest friends.
Levels III and IV are significant stages for souls in their development because now they are given increased responsibilities for younger souls.
The status of a guide is not given to us all at once, however.
As with many other aspects of soul life, we are carefully tested.
The intermediate levels are trial periods for potential teachers.
While our aura is still yellow, our mentors assign us a soul to look after, and then evaluate our leadership performance both in and out of physical incarnations.
Only if this preliminary training is successful are we allowed to function even at the level of a junior guide.
Guides, like everyone else, have different abilities and talents, as well as shortcomings.
By the time we reach Level V, our soul aptitudes are well known in the spirit world.
Different avenues of approach to learning eventually bring all of us to the same end in acquiring spiritual wholeness.
Nenthum, can you tell me if Idis is preparing you to be a guide, assuming you have an interest in that activity?
Oh, then are you developing as a guide yourself?
Do you try and imitate her teaching style?
When did you know you were ready to be a caretaker and begin assisting others spiritually?
It’s an … awareness which comes over you after a great number of lives … that you are more in balance with yourself than previously, and are able to aid people as a spirit and in the flesh.
Are you operating in or out of the spirit world as a caretaker at this time?
I’m out … in two lives.
Are you living in two parallel lives now?
Where are you living in this other life?
Is geography important to your Canadian assignment?
Give me the details of this Canadian life and your responsibilities.
Are you the same age in the Canadian life as you are now in your American one?
About the same.
And your prime assignment in the Canadian life?
To care for Billy.
To help him see the world past his pain.
He is almost blind and his facial disfigurement causes him to be rejected by the community.
I try to open him to an acceptance of life and to know who he really is from the inside.
I read to him and go for walks in the forest holding his arm.
I don’t hold his hands because they are so damaged.
What about your Canadian parents?
I am the parent.
My father left after the fire and never came back.
He was a weak man who was not kind to the family even before the fire.
My mother’s soul is not very … capable in her body.
They need someone with seasoning.
Someone physically strong?
How do you provide for the family?
I am a baker and I’ll never marry, because I can’t leave them.
What is your brother’s major lesson?
To acquire humility without being crushed by a life of little self-gratification.
This subject has been physically injured in a number of past lives.
Yes, I suppose you have.
I wonder if Billy’s soul was ever involved with physically hurting you in one of your past lives?
As a matter of fact, he did in one of them.
When I was the sufferer another caretaker stayed with me and I was a grateful receiver.
Now it is Billy’s turn and I am here for him.
Did you know in advance your brother was going to be incapacitated before you came into the Canadian life?
Sure, Idis and I discussed the whole situation.
She said Billy’s soul would require a caretaker, and since I had negative contact with this soul before in another life, I welcomed the job.
Besides the karmic lesson for Billy’s soul, there are some for you too, in terms of your being in the role of a woman who is tied down.
You can’t just take off and roam around as you often do in your lives.
The degree of difficulty in a life is measured by how challenging the situation is for you, not others.
For me, being Billy’s caretaker is harder than when I was on the receiving end with another soul as my caretaker.
Give me the most difficult factor of this assignment for you as a caretaker.
To sustain a child … through their helplessness … to adulthood … to teach a child to confront torment with courage.
Billy’s life is an extreme example, but it does seem Earth’s children have much physical and emotional pain to go through.
Without addressing and overcoming pain you can never really connect with who you are and build on that.
I must tell you, the more pain and adversity which come to you as a child, the more opportunity to expand your potential.
And how are things working out for you as a caretaker in Canada?
There is a more difficult set of choices to be made in the Canadian family—unlike my American life.
But, I have confidence in myself … to put my comprehension to practical use.
Did Idis encourage or discourage your wanting to accelerate development by living parallel lives?
She is always open about this …
I haven’t done it too much in the past.
Life combinations can be tiring and divisive.
The effort may become counter-productive with diminished returns for both lives.
Well, I see that you are helping people in both your lives today, but have you ever lived contrasting lives where you did poorly in one life and better in another at the same time?
Yes, although that was a long time ago on Earth.
This is one of the advantages of life combinations.
One life can offset the other.
Still, doing this can be rough going.
Then why do the guides permit parallel lives?
I have the impression you think the average soul is better off living one life at a time.
I would say yes, in most instances, but there are other motivations to cause us to speed up incarnations.
Such as … ?
The rewards for bunching up lives can allow for more reflection out of incarnation.
You mean the rest periods between lives might last longer for us after concurrent lives?
Sure, it takes longer to reflect on two lives than one.
What was the original unit.
It is … more dormant … waiting to be rejoined to the rest of our energy.
Most of my colleagues who work with past life clients have listened to overlapping time chronologies from people living on Earth in two places at once.
Occasionally, there are three or more parallel lives.
Souls in almost any stage of development are capable of living multiple physical lives, but I really don’t see much of this in my cases.
Many people feel the idea of souls having the capacity to divide in the spirit world and then attaching to two or more human bodies is against all their preconceptions of a singular, individualized spirit.
I confess that I too felt uncomfortable the first time a client told me about having parallel lives.
I can understand why some people find the concept of soul duality perplexing, especially when faced with the further proposition that one soul may even be capable of living in different dimensions during the same relative time.
Collecting information about spiritual activity from souls who are in the higher stages of development is sometimes frustrating.
This is because the complex nature of memory and knowledge at these levels can make it difficult to sift out what these people recognize and won’t tell me, from what they really don’t know.
Case 22 was both knowledgeable and open to my questions.
This case is compatible with other accounts in my files about the diversity of soul training in the spirit world.
Nenthum, I want to turn now to your activities in the spirit world when you are not so busy with Earth incarnations, interacting in souls groups and learning to be a guide.
Can you tell me of other spiritual areas in which you are occupied?
Yes, there are other areas … I know of them …
I can think of four.
What would you call these areas of activity?
The World Without Ego, the World of All Knowing, the World of Creation and Non-creation, and the World of Altered Time.
Are they worlds which exist in our physical universe?
One does, the rest are non-dimensional spheres of attention.
Why do you call all these spiritual areas worlds?
I see them as … habitations for spiritual life.
So, three of them are mental worlds?
Yes, that’s what they are.
What is the World Without Ego?
It’s the place of learning to be.
Are the ego-identities passed out at random, or is there a choice for beginner souls?
Is there some sort of spiritual inventory of characteristics that are assigned to souls—so much of one type, so much of another?
What does that mean?
To do the best I can with who I am.
So, the purpose of this world is the distribution of soul identity by advanced beings?
Then why do you call it the World Without Ego?
And does the creation of souls with personhood go on continually?
As far as I know, yes.
I wondered if certain types of souls have an affinity for specific forms of physical life in the universe?
I won’t argue against that.
In your beginnings, Nenthum, were you given the opportunity to choose other planetary hosts besides humans on Earth?
Were you given other choices?
Then I was offered service on this severe planet.
Earth is considered severe?
What really appeals to you about Earth?
The kinship humans have for each other while they struggle against one another … competing and collaborating at the same time.
Isn’t that a contradiction?
Humans are egocentric but vulnerable.
They can make their character mean and yet have a great capacity for kindness.
There is weak and courageous behavior on Earth.
It’s always a push-me pull-you tug-of-war going on with human values.
This diversity suits my soul.
What are some of the other things about human hosts which might appeal to the souls who are sent to Earth?
Having apassion to fight for life—that’s what is so worthwhile about humanity.
Humans also have a great capacity for malevolence.
Perhaps it is the soul which fosters the positive characteristics you suggested?
We try to enhance what is already there.
Does any soul ever go back to the World Without Ego after they have once been there and acquired identity?
Yes … but I don’t want to get into that …
Well, then we won’t, but I have been told some souls do return if their conduct during physical assignments is consistently irregular.
I have the impression they are considered defective and are returned to the factory for a kind of spiritual prefrontal lobotomy?
I am offended by that description.
Where did you get such a notion?
Those souls who have developed severe obstacles to improvement are mended by the restoration of positive energy.
Is this procedure just for Earth souls?
No, young souls from everywhere may require restoration as a last resort.
Are these restored spirits then allowed to return to their respective groups and eventually go back to incarnating on physical worlds?
How would you compare the World Without Ego to the World of All Knowing?
Have you been to the World of All Knowing?
What do you know about this spiritual area?
Then the World of All Knowing is abstract in the highest form?
Well, if you can’t go there yet, how come you know about it?
We get … glimpses … as an incentive to encourage us to make that final effort to finish our work and join the masters.
The foundation of the spirit world is a place of knowing and has been alluded to under different names by clients.
I am given only bare references to this universal absolute, because even my advanced subjects have no direct experience there.
All souls are anxious to reach and be absorbed by this nucleus, especially as they draw closer and are enticed by what little they can see.
I’m afraid the World of All Knowing can only be fully understood by a non-reincarnating soul above Level V.
If the World Without Ego and the World of All Knowing are at opposite ends of a soul’s experience, then where does the World of Altered Time fall?
Oh, this must be the physical dimension you told me about?
No, the sphere of Earth is only simulated for my use.
Then all souls in the spirit world wouldn’t study the same simulated world?
And you don’t physically live on this simulated world which appears as Earth—you only use it?
Yes, that’s right—for training purposes.
Why do you call this third sphere the World of Altered Time?
Because we can change time sequences to study specific events.
What is the basic purpose of doing this?
Subjects frequently use the term “world” to describe non-physical spatial work areas.
These regions can be tiny or indescribably large in relation to the soul and may involve different dimensions.
I believe there are separate realities for different learning experiences outside the restrictions of time.
Yes, and we enjoy using it as well.
Is this world intended for the use of all souls?
I am considered a newcomer.
Well, before we get into that, I want to ask if this physical world is the same as Earth.
Is this planet further from its sun than Earth is from our sun?
If I could call this physical world Earth II, since it seems to be geographically similar to the Earth we know, would it be near Earth I in the sky?
Where is Earth II in relation to Earth I?
I can’t tell you.
Is Earth II in our Milky Way galaxy?
No, I think it’s further away.
Could I see the galaxy Earth II is located in with a telescope from my backyard?
I … would think so.
… as a great extended … chain … I can’t tell you more.
As an amateur stargazer who uses a large reflector telescope designed for deep sky objects, I am always inquisitive when a session takes an astronomical turn.
Client responses to these kinds of questions usually fall short of my expectations.
I am never sure if this is due to blocking by guides or the subject’s lack of a physical frame of reference between Earth and the rest of our universe.
I suppose you go to Earth II to reincarnate with some sort of intelligent being?
When do you go to Earth II?
Between my lives on this Earth.
Why do you go to Earth II?
We go there to create and just enjoy ourselves as free spirits.
And you don’t bother the inhabitants of Earth II?
There are no people … it’s so peaceful … we roam among the forests, the deserts, and over oceans with no responsibilities.
What is the highest form of life on Earth II?
Oh … small animals … without much intelligence.
N. Do animals have souls?
Has your soul, and that of your friends, evolved from using lower forms of physical life on Earth I after your creation?
We don’t know for sure, but none of us thinks so.
And all categories of living things are separated from each other?
Are you involved with this element of creation?
Well, who is selected to visit Earth II?
Well, I do see how this Garden of Eden would allow you to rest and be carefree, but you also said you come here to create.
It is no accident then that souls from Earth come to a world that is so similar geographically?
Do other souls, who are not earthbound, go to physical worlds which resemble those planets where they incarnate?
Yes … younger worlds with simpler organisms … to learn to create without any intelligent life around.
Do these physical things resemble what you might see on Earth I?
Start with your arrival on Earth II and explain to me what your soul does first.
I’m … not very good.
Who are the teachers?
Idis and Mulcafgil … and there are other instructors around … I don’t know them very well.
We … form things …
Living things?
Do you actually create the basic elements of our universe?
No, I just use the elements available.
I take the basic elements and charge them with impulses from my energy … and they can change.
Change into what?
I’m good with rocks …
How do you form rocks with your energy?
Oh … by learning to heat and cool … dust … to make it hard.
Do you make the minerals in the dust?
They do that for you … the teachers give us that stuff … gas vapors for water making … and so on …
That’s about right—by alternating our currents of energy radiation.
So, you don’t actually produce the substance of rock and water in some chemical way?
Who do you think nature is?
The maker … and those creating on a grander scale than me.
Well, in a sense you are creating inanimate objects such as rocks.
And you start small, experimenting until you get better?
This all sounds like souls playing as children in a sandbox with toys.
Are the other members of this creative training class from your original cluster group?
Does everyone make the same things as you do?
But, what?
If I am clumsy and do a bad job, I disassemble some creations without showing them to Idis.
Plants … I don’t apply my energy delicately enough to produce the proper chemical conversions.
You are not good with the formation of plant life?
I don’t see why the creator needs your help in creating.
If we are all working up the ladder of development as souls, Nenthum, I am left with the impression the spirit world is one huge organizational pyramid with a supreme authority of power at the top.
It’s hard for me to visualize fabric when there are so many levels of competency for souls.
Think of it as a moving continuum rather than souls being in brackets of highs and lows.
I always think of souls moving up in their existence.
I know you do, but consider us moving across …
Give me something I can picture in my mind.
Are all other souls in different cars?
Yes, but all on the same track.
Where are the conductors such as Idis?
They move back and forth between the connected cars, but sit closer to the engine.
Where is the engine?
Can you see the engine from your car?
It would be nice if all of us were closer to the engine.
Ultimately, we will be.
From what I am able to determine, souls are expected to begin familiarizing themselves with the forces of creation by the time they are solidly established in Level III.
Exposure to plant photosynthesis takes place before student souls work up the organic scale of life.
I am told that early creation training consists of souls learning relationships between substances to develop the ability of unifying their energy with different values in the elements.
The formation of inanimate to animate objects from the simple to the complex is a long, slow process.
Students are encouraged to create miniature planetary microhabitats for a given set of organisms which can adapt to certain environmental conditions.
With practice comes improvement, but not until they approach Level V do my clients begin to feel they might actually contribute to the development of living things.
We will hear more about this with Case 23; however, many of my clients won’t, or can’t, talk about creation.
Some souls seem to have a natural gift for working with energy in their creation classes.
My cases indicate ability in creation assignments does not mean a soul is at the same level of advancement in all other areas of the spiritual curricula.
A soul may be a good technician in harnessing the forces of creation, but lack the subtle techniques of a competent guide.
Perhaps this is why I have been given the impression that the highly advanced soul is allowed to specialize.
Spiritual experience is not easily translated into human language.
Case 22 talks about the World of Altered Time as a means of transient planetary study.
To someone in trance, it is the timeless mental world that is true reality while all else is an illusion created for various benefits.
Other subjects at about the same level call this sphere “the space of transformation” or simply “rooms of recreation.”
Here, I’m told, souls are able to meld their energy into animate and inamate objects created for learning and pleasure.
One subject said to me, “I think of what I want and it happens.
I know I’m being assisted.
We can be anything familiar to our past experiences.”
For instance, souls can become rocks to capture the essence of density, trees for serenity, water for a flowing cohesiveness, butterflies for freedom and beauty and whales for power and immensity.
Some subjects tell of being mystical spirits of nature including figures I associate with folklore, such as elves, giants and mermaids.
Personal contact with strange mythological beasts are mentioned as well.
These accounts are so vivid it is hard for me to simply label them as metaphoric.
Are the old folk tales of many races pure superstition, or manifestations of shared soul experience?
I have the sense that many of our legends are the sympathetic memories of souls carried from other places to Earth long ago.
WE have seen how a soul’s decision to come forward into the next life at a specific time and place on Earth involves an ordered progression of spiritual planning.
As I bring the soul consciousness of my subjects nearer to the moment of their exit from the spirit world, most become quietly introspective, while others engage in light bantering with their friends.
These reactions toward what lies ahead depend more upon the individual soul than on the length of time since a last incarnation.
Rebirth is a profound experience.
Those souls getting ready for embarkation to Earth are like battle-hardened veterans girding themselves for combat.
This is the last chance for souls to enjoy the omniscience of knowing just who they are before they must adapt to a new body.
My last case involves the soul of a woman who offers us a well-defined description of her most recent passage to Earth.
Has the time arrived for you to be reborn into your next life?
Yes, it has.
What is uppermost in your mind about returning to Earth?
The opportunity to live in the twentieth century.
It’s an exciting time of many changes.
Yes … I’ve been through that …
Is there something else you want to talk to me about concerning your next incarnation?
I am having a last talk with Pomar on all the alternatives to my project .
Might this be considered a final exit interview with Pomar?
Yes, I suppose it would.
Would it help you to talk to me about the contingency plans you have for the next life?
I … think I have them straight …
How did your recognition class go?
I assume that phase of your preparation is complete?
Uh-huh … I’ve met with the rest for my project.
Are the recognition signs clear in your mind for meeting the right souls at the right time?
Ah … the signals … my compacts with people … yes, that’s all done.
Without analyzing or censoring your impressions in any way, tell me what you are feeling at this moment.
I’m … just … gathering myself for … the big jump into a new life … there is apprehension … but I am excited, too …
Are you a little scared and perhaps wondering if you should go to Earth at all?
A little … concern … for what lies ahead of me … leaving my home here … but happy, too, at the opportunity.
So you have mixed emotions about leaving the spirit world?
Most of us do, as our time draws near.
I have second thoughts before some lives … but Pomar knows when I am lagging behind my schedule—you can’t hide anything here, you know.
Okay, let’s assume it’s a go situation for your next life.
On the count of three, your decision to return at an appointed time is firm and you are in the final stage to leave the spirit world.
Anyway, they all wish me well and I move away from them … drifting alone.
There is no great rush … Pomar allows me to collect my thoughts.
When I am quite ready he comes to escort me … to offer encouragement … reassurance … and he knows when I am prepared to go.
I sense that you are now more upbeat about the prospect of rebirth.
Yes, it’s a period of inspiration and expectations … a new body … the course ahead …
I now prepare this subject to leave the spirit world for the last time before her current life.
I am as careful here as when I brought her into the spirit world for the first time following normal age-regression.
Starting with a reinforcement of the protective energy shield already placed around this subject, I apply additional conditioning techniques to keep her soul in proper balance with the mind of the child she is joining on Earth.
All right, you and Pomar are together for your exit from the spirit world.
I want you to go deep inside yourself and explain to me what you do next as if it were happening in slow motion.
What do you see and feel?
Then what?
… Away … slanting away … through pillows of whiteness … moving away …
Oh, I’m … passing through … folds of silky cloth … smooth … I’m on a band … a pathway … faster and faster …
Everything is blurred … I’m sliding down … down into a long, dark tube … a hollow feeling … darkness … then … warmth!
Where are you now?
I’m aware of being inside my mother.
Who are you?
I’m in a baby—I’m a baby.
The hollow tube effect described by my cases is apparently not the mother’s birth canal.
It is similar to the tunnel souls pass through at physical death and may be the same route.
The reader might wonder why I would take more care with the act of birthing when I have already brought my subjects in and out of a number of past lives during a session.
There are two reasons.
First, reliving a past life does not need to involve the birthing process.
I help my clients go straight from the spirit world into the next life, usually as adults.
Second, if I return subjects to their current body and decide to command them to relive the birthing experience, I want to remove any minor discomforts felt by some people after they wake up.
Before continuing with this case, I should offer a little more general information about souls and babies.
All my subjects tell me the transition of their souls from the spirit world to the mind of a baby is relatively more rapid than the passage back.
What is the reason for this difference?
After physical death our souls travel through the time tunnel and move past a gateway into the spirit world in a progressive way.
We have seen how the outward passage is intended to be more gradual than our return to Earth in order to allow for acclimatization of a newly freed soul.
However, as souls who enter babies, we come from a state of all-knowing and thus are mentally able to adjust more quickly to our surroundings than at the end of a physical life.
Then too, we are given additional time for adaptation while in our mother’s womb.
Nevertheless, having this time inside our mother does not mean we are fully prepared for the jarring paroxysm of birth, with blinding hospital lights, having to suddenly breathe air, and being physically handled for the first time.
My subjects say if they were to compare the moment of birth with that of death, the physical shock of being born is much greater.
At some point prior to birth, the soul will carefully touch and join more fully with the impressionable, developing brain of a baby.
When a soul decides to enter a baby, apparently that child has no free choice in accepting or rejecting the soul.
At the moment of first entry, chronological time begins for the soul.
I have had cases where souls timed their arrival at the last minute during delivery, but this is unusual.
My findings indicate even those souls who join the baby early seem to do a lot of traveling outside the mother’s womb during her term.
The immortal soul then becomes the seat of perception for the developing human ego.
The soul brings a spiritual force which is the heritage of infinite consciousness.
Although I have said souls can be confined by a human in trauma, they are never trapped.
Besides leaving at the moment of death, souls may also come and go when the body is sleeping, in deep meditation, or under an anesthetic in surgery.
The soul’s absences are much longer in cases of severe brain damage and coma.
This coupling of an intelligent life force before birth brings us full circle from the death scene described in Case 1.
Well, I’m glad you arrive safe and sound in your new body.
Tell me, how old is the baby?
Five months have passed .
Is this your usual arrival time as far as the maturation of a child?
In my lives … I have arrived at different times … depending on the baby, the mother, and my life-to-be.
As a soul, are you in distress if the baby is aborted from the mother’s womb for any reason before full term?
We know if a baby is going to full term or not.
Not being born comes as no surprise to us.
We may be around to just comfort the child.
Well, if the child does not go to term, is your life assignment as a soul aborted as well?
No, there never was a full life assignment as far as that child was concerned.
Might some babies who are aborted never have souls?
That depends on how far along they are.
The ones who die very early often don’t need us.
This issue was as hotly debated in the past as it is today.
During the thirteenth century, the Christian church found it necessary to establish guidelines for the existence of souls with regard to an aborted fetus.
St. Thomas Aquinas and other medieval theologians arbitrarily decided en-soulment took place forty days after conception.
Assuming a baby is going to full term, do you know about the convergence habits of other souls with these children?
Oh, some float around more than others, going in and out of the baby until birth because they get bored.
What do you usually do?
I’m average, I guess.
Actually, I don’t spend a long time at any one stretch with babies because it can get pretty dull.
All right, let’s take this current situation inside your mother and allow some time to pass.
What do you do when you are not with the unborn baby?
You want the truth?
I’ll tell you.
I have fun with my friends who are doing the same thing.
We bounce around Earth to visit with each other … and go to interesting places … where we have once lived together in former lives.
Don’t you and these other souls feel leaving the unborn baby for long periods is shirking the responsibilities of your assignment on Earth?
When you leave the baby for a while, what astral plane are you on in relation to Earth?
We are still on the Earth plane … and we try not to get too distracted, either.
A lot of our fooling around is in the neighborhood of the baby.
I don’t want you to get the idea there is nothing for us to do with unborn babies.
I’m busy with this new mind, even though it’s not fully ready.
Why don’t we talk more about that?
When your soul enters a baby to remain with this new body for a lifetime, give me the scope of this undertaking.
Once I attach to a child it is necessary to bring my mind into synchronization with the brain.
This is what other people tell me, but do you and the baby have an affinity for each other right away?
Well … I am in the mind of the child but separate, too.
I go slowly at first.
Okay, why don’t you explain what you do with the mind of the baby.
It’s delicate and can’t be hurried.
I start with a gentle probe … defining connections … gaps … every mind is different.
Is there any conflict within the child against you?
As you integrate with the baby, when does it become receptive to the force of your identity as a soul?
I’m disturbed by your word “force.”
Did it take you many lives to learn to trace a human brain?
Uh … a while … new souls are assisted with their tracing.
Since you represent pure energy, are you tracing electrical brain connections such as neurotransmitters, nerve cells, and the like?
Well, something like that … I disrupt nothing, though …while I learn the brain wave patterns of the baby.
Are you referring to the thought-regulation circuitry of the mind?
How this person translates signals.
Its capacity.
No two children are the same.
Be completely frank with me.
Isn’t your soul taking over this mind and subjugating it to your will?
You don’t understand.
It’s a melding.
There is an … emptiness before my arrival which I fill to make the baby whole.
Do you bring intellect?
We expand what is there.
Could you be more specific about what your soul actually provides the human body?
We bring a … comprehension of things … a recognition of the truth of what the brain sees.
Are you sure this child doesn’t think of you at first as an alien entity in her mind?
No, that’s why we unify with undeveloped minds.
It’s as if the baby was waiting for me to come.
Do you think a higher power prepares the baby for you?
I don’t know, it would seem so.
Is your work at unification completed before birth?
Not really, but at birth we have started to complement each other.
So, the unification process does take some time?
Sure, while we adjust to each other.
And, like I told you, I leave the unborn baby at intervals.
But what about those souls who join babies at the last minute before birth?
They have to start their work in the crib.
How far along in age is the body by the time your soul stops leaving the child altogether?
At about five or six years of age.
Usually we get fully operational when the child starts school.
Children under this age can be left to their own devices a lot.
Don’t you have a duty to always be with your body?
If things get bad in a physical way—then I’m back inside like a shot.
How would you know this if you were off fooling around with other souls?
Every brain has a wave pattern—it’s like a fingerprint.
We know immediately if the baby assigned to us is in trouble.
So, you are watching the baby assigned to you all the time— both inside and out—during the early stages of growth?
Oh yes, and I watch the parents.
They might be having squabbles around the baby which sets up disturbing vibrations.
If this happens to the child, what do you do as its soul?
Quiet the child as best I can.
Reach out to the parents through the baby to calm them.
Give me an example of how you can reach out to your parents?
Oh, make the baby laugh in front of them by poking my parents’ faces with both hands.
This sort of thing further endears babies to parents.
As a soul, you can control motor movements of the baby?
I can tickle the kid’s funny bone sometimes, too … I’ll do whatever it takes to bring harmony to my assigned family.
Tell me what it is like being inside a mother’s womb.
I like the warm comfortable feeling of love.
Most of the time there is love … sometimes there is stress.
Anyway, I use this time to think and plan what I am going to do after birth.
I think about my past lives and missed opportunities with other bodies and this gives me incentive.
And you haven’t yet had the memories of all your past lives and your life in the spirit world blocked out by amnesia?
That starts after birth.
The child mind is so undeveloped it does not reason out this information.
By the time I speak, this information is locked deep inside me and that’s the way it’s supposed to be.
So, will you have fleeting thoughts of other lives as a child?
Yes … we daydream … the way we play as children … creating stories … having imaginary friends who are real …but it fades.
In the first few years of life babies know more than they are given credit for.
All right, now it is the time right before your birth in this life.
Tell me what you are doing.
I’m listening to music.
What music?
I’m listening to my father play records—very relaxing for him—it helps him to think—I’m a bit anxious for him …
He thinks he wants a boy, but I’ll change his mind in a hurry!
So, this is a productive time for you?
Yes, I’m busy planning for the approaching time when I will enter the world as a human and take that first breath.
This is my last chance for quiet contemplation of the next life.
When I come out—I’ll be running.
THE information contained in this book about the existence of souls after physical death represents the most meaningful explanation I have found in my life as to why we are here.
All my years of searching to discover the purpose of life hardly prepared me for that moment when a subject in hypnosis finally opened the door to an eternal world.
My oldest friend is a Catholic priest today.
He once told me, “I think it must take courage for you to be an atheist and believe in nothing beyond this life.”
I didn’t see it that way at the time, nor for many years afterward.
Starting at age five, I had been sent by my parents to military-type boarding schools for long periods.
The feelings of abandonment and loneliness were so great I believed in no higher power than myself.
I now realize strength was given to me in subtle ways I was unable to see.
My friend and I still have different approaches to spirituality, but we both have convictions today that order and purpose in the universe emanate from a higher consciousness.
Looking back, I suppose it was no accident in my own life that people would eventually come to me for hypnosis—a medium of truth I could believe in—to tell me about guides, heavenly gateways, spiritual study groups, and creation itself in a world of souls.
Even now, I sometimes feel like an intruder in the minds of those who describe the spirit world and their place in it, but their knowledge has given me direction.
Still, I wonder why I am the messenger for the spiritual knowledge contained in this book, when someone with less original cynicism and doubt would surely have been much better suited.
Actually, it is the people represented in these cases who are the real messengers of hope for the future, not the reporter.
Everything I have learned about who we are and where we come from, I owe to those who were drawn to me for help.
They have taught me that a major aspect of our mission on Earth as souls is to mentally survive being cut off from our real home.
While in a human body, the soul is essentially alone.
Our doubts tempt us into finding attachments solely in a physical world we can see.
The scientific knowledge that Earth is only a grain of sand at the edge of a galactic shoreline within a vast sea in the universe adds to our feelings of insignificance.
I used to do so myself.
However, there is logic to the concept we were not created by accident for mere survival, and that we do operate within a universal system which directs the physical transformation of Self for a reason.
I believe it is the voice of our souls, which tell us we do have personhood that is not intended to die.
All the accounts of life after death in my case files have no scientific foundation to prove the statements of these subjects.
To those readers who find the material offered in this book too unprecedented to accept, I would hope for one thing.
If you carry away nothing except the idea you may have a permanent identity worth finding, I will have accomplished a great deal.
One of the most troublesome concerns of all people who want to believe in something higher than themselves is the causality of so much negativity in the world.
Evil is given as the primary example.
When I ask my subjects how a loving God could permit suffering, surprisingly there are few variations in their responses.
My cases report our souls are born of a creator which places a totally peaceful state deliberately out of reach so we will strive harder.
We learn from wrongdoing.
The absence of good traits exposes the ultimate flaws in our nature.
That which is not good is testing us, otherwise we would have no motivation to better the world through ourselves, and no way to measure advancement.
When I ask my subjects about the alternating merciful and wrathful qualities we perceive to be the self-expression of a teacher-oversoul, some of them say the creator only shows certain attributes to us for specific ends.
For instance, if we equate evil with justice and mercy with goodness and if God allowed us only to know mercy, there would be no state of justice.
This book presents a theme of order and wisdom rising from many spiritual energy levels.
Thus, complete infallibility is deferred to an even higher divine source.
From my work I have come to believe that we live in an imperfect world by design.
Earth is one of countless worlds with intelligent beings, each with its own set of imperfections to bring into harmony.
Extending this thought further, we might exist as one single dimensional universe out of many, each having its own creator governing at a different level of proficiency in levels similar to the progression of souls seen in this book.
To my mind, a supreme, perfect God would not lose omnipotence or total control over all creation by allowing for the maturation of less-than-perfect superior offspring.
These lesser gods could be allowed to create their own imperfect worlds as a final means of edification so they might join with the ultimate God.
The reflected aspects of divine intervention in this universe must remain as our ultimate reality.
If our God is not the best there is because of the use of pain as a teaching tool, then we must accept this as the best we have and still take the reasons for our existence as a divine gift.
Certainly this idea is not easy to convey to someone who is physically suffering, for example, from a terminal illness.
Pain in life is especially insidious because it can block the healing power of our souls, especially if we have not accepted what is happening to us as a preordained trial.
Yet, throughout life, our karma is designed so that each trial will not be too great for us to endure.
At a wat temple in the mountains of Northern Thailand, a Buddhist teacher once reminded me of a simple truth.
The highest forms of this expression are acts of kindness.
Our soul may be traveling away from a permanent home, but we are not just tourists.
We bear responsibility in the evolution of a higher consciousness for ourselves and others in life.
Thus, our journey is a collective one.
We are divine but imperfect beings who exist in two worlds, material and spiritual.
It is our destiny to shuttle back and forth between these universes through space and time while we learn to master ourselves and acquire knowledge.
We must trust in this process with patience and determination.
Our essence is not fully knowable in most physical hosts, but Self is never lost because we always remain connected to both worlds.
Perhaps the most gratifying feature of my work in uncovering the existence of a spirit world in the minds of my subjects is the effect this conscious knowledge has on them.
The most significant benefit which comes from knowing we have a home of everlasting love waiting for us, is being receptive to the higher spiritual power within our minds.
One day we are going to finish this long journey—all of us—and reach an ultimate state of enlightenment, where everything is possible.
Writing an autobiography might seem like an inappropriate exercise for a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk, since we bhikkhus strive to eradicate the ego, not glorify it.
Through meditation and mindfulness we want to let go of attachments and practice selflessness.
Why then would I write a whole book about me?
The idea, oddly enough, came from my meditation retreats.
Whenever I teach a retreat, I invite attendees to write questions on slips of paper and put them in a box.
Each evening, after my formal Dhamma talk, a lecture about the essence of the Buddha’s teachings, I pull a few of the slips out of the box, one by one, and answer whatever question is there.
Usually people want to know about meditation: how to keep up the momentum they’ve built at the retreat; what to do when they are so agitated they can’t sit still; how to practice if they don’t have a good teacher nearby.
Sometimes, though, someone asks a question about my life:
“How long have you been a monk?”
“What was it like, growing up in Sri Lanka?”
“How do you maintain monastic discipline in this world full of temptations?”
When I answer those kinds of questions, I tend to ramble.
I tell stories about my life and people seem to enjoy them.
The meditation hall, usually a silent place, fills with laughter.
Often the students say, “Bhante, you should write your autobiography!”
I’ve read a few life stories of spiritual men and women, and in them, it always seems like miraculous, wondrous things happen to the main character.
Sometimes, the main character may even be the one performing miracles.
Reading these amazing stories, one might conclude that spiritual people are somehow very different from regular people.
As for me, I can claim no miracles.
I have been a simple person all my life.
Early on I learned that if I worked hard, I would usually get good results — nothing supernatural about that.
In many ways my life is probably much like yours.
And so I was hesitant to write the book my students were suggesting.
“Not necessarily,” a friend told me.
“You might be able to do some teaching by telling your own story.” I thought about that.
As a monk, I have dedicated my life to protecting and maintaining the Buddha’s teachings.
I have found that because of that, the Dhamma has protected and maintained me as well.
That’s what I have learned in my seventy-five years.
And that’s the essence of what I want to share with you in all these rambling stories about my life.
For example, I can say sincerely that whenever I was arrogant in my life, I suffered a great deal.
As a young man in monks’ college, I spied on other students, I gossiped, I was always looking for others’ faults.
And because of that, I was miserable.
In fact, I’d say that has always been my greatest weakness: finding fault in others.
But more or less, I’m happy to say, I can now pretty much accept people as they are.
And my life is so much smoother as a result.
By relying on the Buddha’s teachings, I have learned slowly to withdraw from conflict rather than charging into it or, worse still, going looking for it.
That, too, has made life immeasurably more peaceful.
But my own anger, contentiousness, and judgmentalness were fertile ground for practice.
Just because a person becomes a monk, by no means is he immediately free from all defilements of character or empty of worldly concerns.
As you will see over and over in this book, even in the supposedly noble world of spiritual work, I encountered — in myself and in others — petty jealousies, backstabbing, indifference, and cruelty.
When I reminisce now, I can see that all those things that seemed so awful at the time have ultimately led to positive outcomes.
All the people and situations that I thought were painful were also teachers pushing me in the direction I was supposed to go, pointing out what I needed to learn to become happy.
In retrospect, I am grateful for the mysterious chain of causes and effects that unfolded in my life, even though many of them felt awful and unlucky at the time.
If my father had not been such a strict disciplinarian, I might not have left home to become a monk.
If my teachers hadn’t punished me so severely, I wouldn’t have gone off to missionary school.
If I hadn’t lost my memory and needed a “cure,” I might never have taken an interest in meditation.
If I hadn’t fallen sick working with the Untouchables of India, I wouldn’t have left to go to Malaysia.
If my visa had been extended in Malaysia, I probably would never have ventured to America.
But this has been my life, and I am grateful for all of it.
Even so, it pained me to write about some of these things, to dredge up the memories of old hurts and conflicts.
Several times I nearly lost my nerve and withdrew from the plans for this book.
In my periods of doubt, I kept remembering the words of Mark Twain: “Only dead men tell the truth.”
I thought about the sometimes ugly truths of my life, and I worried.
If I wrote about them honestly, I would be displaying my weaknesses, my shortcomings.
But hiding the truth — well, that didn’t feel right either.
And furthermore, it seemed so un-monk-like to write about unpleasant conversations and situations that happened decades ago, to reveal people who were unkind to me, especially when many of them aren’t around anymore to defend themselves.
Adding to my worries was the fact that my native culture does not prize open discussion of conflict.
When my Sinhalese nephews read an early draft of this manuscript, they were aghast.
“You can’t talk about people this way,” they said.
People in Sri Lanka don’t want to hear about a monk’s mistakes or character flaws.
They prefer to think of him as an exalted holy man to whom they can bow down in reverence.
In the spiritual economy of Asian Buddhist monastics and laypeople, honoring a venerable bhikkhu by giving him gifts or supporting him brings spiritual merit.
To find out that he is anything less than worthy would disturb a layperson’s sense of order.
But in Western culture, the truth is highly prized.
And if I portrayed myself as never having struggled with difficulties and shortcomings, my story certainly wouldn’t help anyone see the value of the Dhamma in dealing with life’s slings and arrows.
The first of the Buddha’s noble truths is that life contains suffering.
We cannot avoid suffering.
Our only option is to work at overcoming the defilements within ourselves that cause suffering: greed, anger, and delusion.
Overcoming these defilements is a lifelong task, as I hope the story of my simple life, my own journey to mindfulness, will show.
But I also hope my story will illustrate that, no matter how strong they may be, the sources of suffering can be overcome in your life, too!
I WAS BORN on the seventh of December 1927, in Henepola, Ceylon.
Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, is a teardrop-shaped island off the southeast coast of India.
It is a beautiful place of lushly forested mountains, rice paddies, and farms of rubber plants and tea trees.
In the late 1920s, the tiny village of Henepola was home to about forty families.
The village was not accessible by road, and it had no school, police station, post office, shops, or restaurants.
It consisted entirely of a cluster of huts and the nearby Buddhist temple, our only public gathering place.
No one in Henepola had electricity or running water, but there was a small river that ran through our village.
The nearest large town was a three-mile walk on a narrow dirt path that wound through groves of coconut trees and tea estates, and the nearest other village was a half mile away.
People from my country have only to hear my ordained name, Henepola Gunaratana, to know where I was born.
The Sinhalese custom is for a monk to receive a new name at ordination: The surname has spiritual meaning, and the first name is that of his birthplace.
When I was a boy, Ceylon was a British colony valued for its spices, tea, rubber, and precious gems, as well as for its strategic location on the silk trading route between Europe and China.
Most of the country’s 1.5 million people were farmers, and my family was no exception.
We grew rice, coconuts, coffee, and other crops on small plots of land, sometimes our own, sometimes rented from British estates.
Nearly everyone in our village was poor, desperately poor.
But our Theravada Buddhist belief system gave us unshakable confidence in life.
According to kamma, the law of cause and effect, current circumstances are the result of past actions.
More importantly, future circumstances will be the result of our current actions.
Therefore, we believed it was best to try hard and carry on, regardless of the difficulties in our lives.
Buddhism, in fact, permeates my earliest memories.
Our entire village’s anchor was the temple.
People went there to visit the monks and ask them to chant suttas, or Buddhist discourses, for nearly every event: weddings, birthdays, serious illnesses, and deaths.
The monks served as teachers, preachers, and advisors, sometimes even as physicians.
People also enjoyed simply chatting with the monks at any hour of day or night.
The temple was always open.
Four times a month — on the full moon, the new moon, and each quarter moon — people typically spent a twenty-four-hour period at the temple.
It was rather freeform.
Some people sat down to meditate; others did walking meditation or stood near the sacred Bodhi tree, reciting scriptures.
Monks and laypeople took turns delivering sermons in the preaching hall, where people sat or reclined on the cool concrete floor.
I remember as a child, I’d doze off in my mother’s lap during those sermons.
My mother’s name was Herat Mudiyanselage Lokumenike.
Her first and middle names mean “person of the highest class,” and her last name means “large gem.”
In Ceylon at that time, women kept their maiden names when they married.
My father’s name was Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Puncibanda.
Translated roughly, his first and middle names mean “a person of high class,” and his last name means “treasure.”
It was simply coincidence that my mother’s middle name, which she inherited from her father, was the same middle name as her husband’s.
I was the second youngest of seven children.
One of those sisters was so much older that she had married and left home before I was even born.
Two girls were born after me, but one died as an infant.
My birth was attended by a midwife, who received a measure of rice and a coconut for her trouble.
I came into this world at home in a dimly lit hut with no windows.
While my mother was in labor, she alternately squatted and lay on a mat made of palm fronds spread over the floor.
As was the custom, the midwife tied a rope to the roof beam; it hung down over my mother’s mat so that she could pull on it as a distraction when the pain became unbearable.
She delivered all eight of her children that way.
Two weeks after my birth, when it looked likely I was hearty enough to survive, my father went to visit the chief of a nearby village.
All births and deaths had to be officially registered with a local chief, but Henepola was too small to have its own chief, so my father walked a half mile to the nearest village, Dehideniya.
There, he told the chief the name he had given his third son: Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Ukkubanda.
Ukku means small and banda means treasure.
It’s a fond name adults use to refer tenderly to a baby.
Often the name, even though it’s used for an infant, would remain into adulthood.
As I got older, though, my parents decided to call me Kudabanda, which means something like “small boy.”
That made sense, I suppose, because I was the last boy in the family.
But I never asked them why they called me that instead of my legal name.
My father built our house himself.
It was maybe thirty by forty feet.
The roof was made of straw, dried fronds from coconut trees, and scraps of tin.
The walls were made of mud, reinforced with strips of bamboo.
Along the front and back of the house were open verandas, with walls that were made of mud on the lower half and a wooden lattice on the upper half.
Compared to many huts in the village, ours was spacious.
It had two rooms.
One was a small, dark kitchen; the other was a storage room for my father’s papers, books, and tools.
The furniture was sparse, and all of it handmade, consisting of a couple of small, crude benches and a chair woven of beech strips.
I remember my father sitting upright in that chair after meals, smoking a cigar or chewing betel nut while he told us stories or gave us lectures.
My mother sat on a bench, never in Father’s chair.
We children sat on the floor.
The floor was made of mud, like the walls, but every so often my mother and sisters smeared fresh cow dung over it, using their bare hands.
Manure was considered a germicide, its odor the smell of freshness.
We walked on that floor every day, barefoot.
There were only two beds, each a crude wooden platform topped by a cloth sack stuffed with dried coconut husks.
Those “mattresses” were only a little softer than a pile of rocks.
My oldest brother, Tikiribanda, slept in one bed, which was on the veranda at the front of our hut.
My other brother and I slept near him, on the bare floor.
The other bed, on the back veranda, was my father’s.
Never once did I see my mother lying in that bed with him; she slept with my sisters on the floor.
I never saw my parents kiss or hug or even have a private conversation.
Our parents did, however, share a deep devotion to Buddhism.
Every morning we children woke up to the singsong chant of them reading Pali suttas.
These daily recitations served as our lullaby at night, too.
Before we even learned the alphabet, we could recite Pali devotional stanzas from memory, and we knew what the words kamma and rebirth meant.
Day after day my parents went about their routines without grumbling.
Every morning my father went off to work in the rice paddy, or on our small rubber estate.
My mother stayed home and took care of the house and us children.
When my father came home, she would have a meal ready for him.
Both of my parents knew how to read and write in Sinhalese, which was a rarity in our village and in most of rural Ceylon.
Because my father was literate, and was known as a man of dignity and strict moral principles, he was the most highly respected man in Henepola.
The other villagers often came to him to settle their disputes.
With his own family, though, my father could be a terror.
And he showed his temper in a violent way.
Punishment for us children was swift and painful, and sometimes he even beat my mother.
When that happened, all of us hid.
We were afraid that if we made a sound, his rage would turn on us.
My mother had no formal education, but she was very intelligent.
She taught herself how to read and write, and she knew a lot about herbal medicine.
Her intuition was powerful.
I was very close to my oldest sister, Dingiriamma.
When I was almost two, she gave birth to her second child, a girl who died a couple of weeks later.
Although I had already started to eat solid food, I still loved to drink milk, but our family had no cow and my mother’s milk flow had long since stopped.
So, for almost a year after her baby died, Dingiriamma took me to her breast and fed me as if I were her own child.
She and her husband lived in a village called Gunadaha, three miles away, and a couple of times a week, she would walk to our house and nurse me.
To this day, I still consider her my second mother.
We were perhaps closer to each other than to all of the other five siblings.
My mother and sisters had the job of gathering firewood for cooking fuel.
In an area forested mostly with palm trees and cocoa plants, wood was scarce.
Often, they had to rip dead branches off rubber trees.
Since we had no electricity, we relied on the dim light of coconut oil lamps.
Sometimes, when we didn’t have enough oil for the lamps, my mother made a torch out of nuts from the kekune tree.
She would remove the hard shell from ten or fifteen nuts, and then impale them on a stick.
The natural oil in the nuts would burn for hours.
Although our village didn’t have running water, our family was lucky because about two hundred yards from the house, we had a private well.
We used the water for bathing, drinking, and washing clothes.
My mother and sisters hauled the spring water to the house in large earthen pots, which had round bellies and small mouths.
I remember how water stayed so cool in those pots.
We could fold one into a bucket shape and carry two or three gallons of water in it.
No matter how clean we kept our bodies, our clothes, and our mattresses, we all suffered the agony of bed bugs.
I vividly remember scratching the swollen, red places on my body where bed bugs had bitten me.
We had mosquitoes and flies, too, but those you could combat by burning coconut husks.
Bed bugs, on the other hand, were nearly impossible to get rid of.
They were barely visible, and hid in the coconut husk mattresses.
Even though we often washed those mattresses and dried them in the sun, the bed bugs always came back.
Some people would move their mattresses away from the wall or place little tin cans of oil under each leg of their bed, but the bed bugs were determined.
If they couldn’t climb up the legs of the bed, they crawled up the wall and dropped down from the ceiling like tiny kamikaze pilots.
Leeches were another problem.
Whenever my brother and I went exploring, we’d come home with leeches clinging to our legs or burrowed between our toes.
We would pull them off, but often their minute teeth stayed imbedded in our skin.
A couple of days later, there would be open wounds where the leeches had bitten us.
Sometimes blueflies laid their eggs there.
Those eggs would hatch into maggots, which of course made the wounds worse.
I still have scars on my legs.
My father had inherited several acres of land: a one-acre rubber estate, a half-acre tea plantation, a one-acre rice field, and the cleared acre on which he built our house.
In addition to farming rice, tea, and rubber, my father also enjoyed gardening.
In the clearing around our house, he planted bougainvillea and hibiscus.
Next to the house, he planted a mixed hedge of jasmine and roses, which he neatly trimmed with a large knife.
He also grew numerous cash crops: sweet potatoes, tapioca, beans, eggplant, okra, bitter gourds, cabbage, and coffee.
However, even with that much food growing nearby, there was still never enough to feed us all.
In addition to our property, we had two water buffalo, which my father used to pull a plow across the rice paddy.
Luckily, we did not have to feed the buffalo produce from our fields and gardens; they ate grass or the thorny, discarded shells of jackfruit.
My father traded his crops for dried fish, spices, sugar, salt, kerosene oil, and other supplies we couldn’t grow or make ourselves.
To do his trading, he walked three miles to a town called Galagedara, where there were some shops run by Muslims and Hindu Tamils.
Often he couldn’t find what he wanted; everything seemed to be in short supply.
To help support his seven hungry children, my father also did carpentry work for our neighbors.
Unfortunately, people could rarely afford to pay him.
Maybe it was the constant financial worries that made him so cross.
He was a severe disciplinarian.
He kept a stick hidden on the roof of the house and used it quickly and forcefully to punish us for any slight wrongdoing.
His shout was so frightening that we would tremble when we heard it.
One of our earliest pranks was throwing stones at cows and birds.
One day we saw a dog with puppies.
My brother picked up a handful of stones and told me to climb a nearby tree.
His plan was to harass the dog while we were safely ensconced in the tree.
I told Rambanda the tree was too high to climb, that I was too small.
“Please don’t,” I begged.
“She’ll bite me.”
But he was intent.
He swung himself up into the tree, then started pelting the dog with stones.
I ran as fast as I could, but the dog was faster.
I fell down and she bit me.
When my brother and I got home, we had to explain why I was bleeding.
My father beat both of us for being cruel to the dog.
Rambanda and I always seemed to be hungry.
Edible fruits or nuts we found while playing were great treats.
If they were growing on someone’s property, we’d ask the property owner’s permission.
If they said no, we took the fruits anyway.
One day my brother and I were on our way to our family’s rubber estate.
Halfway there, we passed a small field belonging to a poorer family.
There were about fifty corn plants growing in that field.
One plant near the road had a ripe ear of corn hanging on it.
My brother looked around and saw no one, so he picked the ear and broke it in half.
One piece for him, one for me: delicious!
On our way home, we passed the cornfield again.
This time, for some reason, we decided to be honest.
My brother went to the owner’s house and asked her for an ear of corn.
The woman said there was one just next to the road, and we were welcome to it.
She came out into the field to show us where it was, but when we reached the corn stalks by the road, the woman saw that the ear she intended to give us was gone.
Then she noticed a small footprint in the mud.
She asked my brother to place his foot in the footprint.
He did, and it was a perfect fit.
We were obviously guilty, but the woman didn’t appear angry.
She said, “You boys go home.
I’ll bring you some more corn.”
We started off happily toward home.
When we reached our house, however, the woman was already there.
She had told our father the whole story and he was waiting for us, stick in hand, angrier than I had ever seen him.
This was a doubly bad deed.
Not only had we broken the Buddhist precept against stealing, but we also had stolen from a lower-caste family who had very little.
Father thrashed us until our backs began to bleed.
My mother tried to stop him, but he kept beating us.
Even the woman, the victim of our crime, begged him to stop.
Everyone was crying, but our father would listen to no one.
He beat us until he was too tired to beat us anymore.
This, of course, would be labeled child abuse today.
But seventy years ago in Ceylon, it was standard practice for parents to punish children by thrashing them.
As a devout Buddhist, my father was determined to teach us the difference between right and wrong, and his methods were simply those of his generation and culture.
Truly, I can’t fault him for that.
That was the uniform for young boys and girls.
When I was eleven, I began to wear two pieces of clothing: a regular shirt and a skirtlike sarong.
Throughout my childhood, I never wore shoes or even sandals; they were too expensive.
We children had to be careful with our clothes because we only got new outfits at New Year’s, which Ceylonese celebrated in mid-April.
My siblings and I also had no toys.
We played with sticks, dry palm fronds, coconut shells, and frayed pieces of discarded rope.
Our playground was the sand in front of our house, the rice fields, or the threshing grounds where farmers separated rice from its stalks.
I also loved to climb trees and explore the forest.
One time I was out exploring and discovered an old woodshed in the forest.
I found some rope and slung it over one of the beams in the shed, to make a swing.
It was great fun for about thirty seconds.
As soon as I started swinging, the beam cracked, broke in two, and fell on top of my head.
Everything felt numb for a moment, then warm liquid began to pour down my forehead and over my face.
I stumbled outside and found an areca palm sheath on the ground.
I pressed it to my head, thinking I somehow had to collect all that blood.
My mother, who seemed to have a sixth sense for knowing when I was in trouble, quickly found me.
She took me home, tenderly washed the wound on my head, and applied one of her herbal ointments.
In the evenings, my brothers, sisters, and I would play hide-and-seek until dinnertime, which was usually around 9 P.M.
As soon as dinner was over, we fell asleep, on the bare floor, without a pillow or blanket.
There was no such thing as brushing our teeth or taking a bath before we went to bed.
To lull us to sleep Mother told beautiful stories, some of them folktales and some Jataka tales, which are stories of the Buddha’s previous lives.
As a child, one of my favorite Jataka stories was about Sasa, the generous rabbit who offered to jump into a fire and sacrifice himself so a hungry old man could have something to eat.
I think I liked that story because I used to gaze at the full moon and would see in its craters and valleys what looked like a rabbit.
I dreamed of being generous enough to reach the moon, where I could sit beside that rabbit and look down on the earth.
My parents always told me the Buddha was soft and gentle like moonlight, shining his brilliance on everyone without discrimination.
So when I thought of the moon, I thought of the rabbit in the moon, of Sasa the generous rabbit, and of the Buddha — all three were interwoven in my mind.
It’s ironic that I liked the story of a self-sacrificing rabbit, because I myself was actually very greedy, especially about food.
I was always on guard over my food, lest someone grab my meal away from me.
If someone even looked at my plate, I would get angry and throw it on the ground.
That was completely foolish, of course, because food was too precious to waste.
But I had a flash temper, perhaps like my father, and I didn’t control it any better than he did.
Sometimes my brothers and sisters stared at my food just to set me off.
Once, when that happened, I flew into such a rage I threw my plate of food out the door.
Father gave me a beating, then made me go and pick up the plate, and of course I didn’t get any more food that meal.
One day, my third sister, who was four years older than I, took a wooden stick and drew a pumpkin in the sand.
I took another stick and scratched it out.
She was so upset that she hit me with a broom.
I grabbed a wooden bench and chased her into the house, then I threw the bench at her.
It hit her big toe and ripped the nail completely off.
There was a lot of blood and immediately she started wailing.
When my mother heard her, she rushed in to help and I ran outside.
That was the first time I remember doing something mean to one of my siblings.
I was seven or eight years old.
Luckily, my father was not home when it happened, and neither my mother nor my sister told him exactly what happened.
I guess they feared my father’s wrath as much as I did.
They simply let him believe my sister’s bandaged toe was the result of an accident.
When I was growing up, there were no cars or even bicycles in our village; walking was the only mode of transportation.
To get to a main road, we either had to walk two miles down a steep hill in one direction or three miles along a flat road in the other direction.
When people were seriously ill and unable to walk, they were tied into a chair or onto a board and carried three miles to the nearest hospital, in Galagedara.
In 1933, when I was five, a malaria epidemic swept Ceylon.
My whole family was sick, off and on, for three years.
The British government distributed quinine, as well as free rice and other food staples, because no one was strong enough to work.
However, there was a catch: We had to walk three miles each week to get our allotment.
We took turns making the trip; whoever was least sick would go.
I remember walking those three miles with a terrible fever, just to get the food and medicine.
I recall two other medical emergencies.
When I was about eight or nine I abruptly lost my night vision, probably because of malnutrition.
After dark, it was as if I were blind.
I couldn’t see anything at all, even with the light from a kerosene lamp.
My brothers and sisters teased me about it, saying I was pretending, but my mother was very concerned.
She consulted the village medicine man, who gave her a bitter-tasting potion for me.
It was made from an herb, but he wouldn’t tell her its name.
Many people believed herbal medicines had mystical powers, and their components were often kept secret.
My mother was supposed to grind the herb into a paste and feed it to me every day until my eyesight improved.
The paste tasted wretched, and to make matters worse, I was supposed to take this foul concoction early in the morning, when my stomach was empty.
To get me to take that medicine, my mother used the power of love.
Before anyone else in the house was awake, she would take me onto her lap.
She would hug me, kiss me, and tell me stories in a low whisper.
After a few minutes, I was so relaxed and happy that I would have done anything she asked.
That was the moment she would put the medicine in my mouth and tell me to swallow it quickly.
She always mixed the bitter paste with sugar, though it still tasted awful.
But after several months of that daily ritual, I completely recovered my eyesight.
Now, many years later, I understand the power of metta, or loving-friendliness.
In a way, it helps us swallow the bitterness of life.
It smooths over the rough moments, the disappointments, the hurt.
The Buddha used the power of metta to “conquer” many of his enemies.
He even instructed monks living in the forest to use metta when confronted by poisonous snakes.
And the Metta Sutta is one of the most beautiful of his discourses.
It is a very short sutta, but one that Buddhist monks usually chant at every formal gathering.
It describes a way of thinking and acting that can bring peace to the practitioner and to those around him or her.
The Buddha told his disciples that the practice of metta is a meritorious deed.
Therefore, while cultivating thoughts of loving-friendliness, we are happy, feeling the kind of deep happiness that comes from performing a meritorious deed.
It’s a sense of peace.
Whenever I teach people how to formally practice loving-friendliness, I give them the following phrases to repeat:
May you be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to you.
May no difficulties come to you.
May no problems come to you.
May you always meet with success.
May you also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.
The first person to whom we direct thoughts of metta is ourself: “May I be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to me.
May no difficulties come to me… ”
Not necessarily.
It is easiest to summon up metta for ourselves because, among all beings on earth, we love ourselves best.
So we can quickly generate those warm feelings of loving-friendliness for ourselves.
We can saturate ourselves in it, fill our bodies and minds with it.
Then, as the goodwill spreads through our being, it naturally spills out.
We have surplus to share.
And we do, with the next most logical group of people: those near and dear to us.
We picture them in our mind’s eye and we repeat the phrases, with those cherished ones as the recipients of our metta.
The next group is the largest.
It includes all those beings we encounter every day, but aren’t as close to.
The passing ¬acquaintances — sometimes complete strangers — who move in and out of our lives.
Classmates, coworkers, neighbors, the checkout clerk at the grocery store, the person sitting in the car next to you at a stoplight, a friendly dog with a wagging tail, someone who whizzes by you on a bike trail.
We extend loving-friendliness to all these beings, human and nonhuman, and wish them well.
It consists of your adversaries, those difficult people who pop up in your life to provide what we might politely call “challenges.”
This is where metta practice becomes sticky for many people.
Yes, said the Buddha.
And here’s why: If we wish that person well, and hope that he has success, maybe he will develop spiritually.
That’s the kind of success we’re wishing for him — spiritual success.
And if he evolves spiritually, he probably won’t be our adversary anymore.
There won’t be any need for that.
He’ll be more peaceful; his noble qualities will emerge.
We’ll all be able to coexist more harmoniously.
But the practice of loving-friendliness shouldn’t be confined to formal repetition of the phrases.
We should cultivate metta in our thoughts, words, and deeds, the Buddha said.
Every step, every action, every reflection should be one of metta.
Whatever a person repeats again and again will become his or her own mental state.
If you practice metta constantly, you yourself will be full of metta.
It will become your nature.
And you’ll realize that others have this soft, gentle nature buried within them, too.
My mother understood and lived the words of the Buddha.
She made sure all her children heard stories of the Buddha’s life and learned about his compassion and wisdom.
She herself was a walking example of metta, always treating anyone she met with gentleness and soft words.
In many ways, I considered her almost a holy person.
About a year after my mysterious bout of night blindness, my mother had an accident that changed her life.
One day she climbed a cocoa tree to pick some cocoa fruit, something she did often.
Father would take them to market and sell them for about five cents a pound.
Dried cocoa seeds were a great delicacy because they could be pounded into cocoa powder.
That day, my mother’s routine turned to tragedy.
When she was high in the tree, a branch gave way under her and she fell.
I heard her cry out, and when I ran over, I found her lying on her back on the ground, unconscious.
Two of my sisters came, as well, and when they saw her, they started crying.
Apparently the neighbors heard my sisters crying and they tried their best to help.
When Mother woke up, one of the neighbors offered her a folk tonic: a drink of brandy with an egg yolk stirred into it.
She refused to drink it.
All her life she had followed the Buddhist precepts, which include a dictum against alcohol.
She didn’t want to break the precept, even if the brandy would dull her pain.
Someone ran to alert my father, who was working in the rice paddy.
My father, in turn, ran to fetch the village medicine man.
Several people helped carry my mother to our house; her back was hurting so much she couldn’t walk.
When they returned, he ground the herbs into a paste and rubbed it on my mother’s back.
He left us with a supply of the paste, and told us to reapply it twice a day.
Every Ceylonese village had both a Buddhist monk and a medicine man, and the two worked cooperatively.
Before preparing any of his herbal medicines, the medicine man would chant Buddhist stanzas in front of his home altar.
He didn’t charge anything for his services, but people routinely gave him gifts of vegetables, coconuts, spices, tea, or betel nut.
It was believed that if the medicine man was a good Buddhist, his potions would have more power.
Therefore, his healing power depended on his purity as a Buddhist.
Even after the British set up a system of local government with a chief in charge of each village, the medicine man and head monk still had the greatest authority.
The chief always consulted with the head monk and the medicine man before making decisions about how to punish a criminal or settle a dispute.
Several days after her fall, my mother was no better.
She couldn’t move her legs or stand up; all she could do was moan in pain.
She barely ate or drank anything except for a little rice soup and some orange juice.
It was obvious she needed more medical care, but my parents didn’t trust hospitals.
My mother said she wanted to go to her parents’ house, about thirty miles from our village.
That was a long journey, but the medicine man in her parents’ village was supposed to be powerful, and my mother said she would be more comfortable in her childhood home.
So Father and a few other men eased her onto a board and carried her to the nearest town.
There, my father hired a car and took her to her parents’ house.
During their trip, we children were left alone.
My second oldest sister was eighteen by then, so she did the cooking and looked after us younger ones.
After a few days, my father returned without my mother.
She had remained at her parents’ house to recuperate.
But she never recovered entirely.
When she finally came home several months later, she was hunchbacked and on crutches.
Her right leg wouldn’t bend at all, and she couldn’t even walk the short distance to the temple.
At age seven, I started school.
The nearest one was in Medagama, about a half mile from our house, and was run by Catholic missionary nuns.
I loved it, mainly because of the delicious lunches we were served each day.
Before eating, we had to say Catholic prayers, our heads bowed over the little food trays placed on our desks.
I closed my eyes and mumbled the words, but my mind was on the tantalizing aromas wafting up to my nose.
I attended the Catholic school for about a year before the Buddhist temple in Dehideniya opened a primary school.
All the children of Henepola, perhaps thirty or forty of us, switched schools.
The first year at the Buddhist school was pretty cramped.
The temple’s preaching hall, an open-air structure, served as the only classroom, and it was always noisy because there were so many of us in one room.
A year later, the government granted a small plot of land next to the temple for a separate school building.
The villagers worked together to build a simple rectangular, one-room building, which was about one hundred feet by thirty feet.
It had five-foot-high walls with only bare openings instead of windows or doors, and the roof was made of coconut palm fronds.
This new building had long tables and hard wooden benches.
During our first year in the new school building, we used slates and slender stone slabs for writing our lessons.
By the second year, however, the government provided pencils and paper exercise books, a real luxury!
Every morning when the teacher walked in, we stood next to our benches and bowed, hands folded in front of our chests.
“Good morning, sir,” we chorused, as he greeted us with a similar bow.
Then it was inspection time.
If something wasn’t, we got a thrashing with his long cane.
In fact, if we did anything wrong at all, our backsides met that cane.
And sometimes the teacher used his knuckles to rap our skulls.
It didn’t occur to anyone that this was cruel, or anything other than usual.
Before lessons began, in Pali we all recited the three refuges — ¬refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha — and the five precepts of Buddhism.
Even the youngest children knew these recitations by heart, because everyone had heard their parents chanting them at home every single day of their lives.
The school curriculum included Sinhalese grammar, history, science, arithmetic, and of course, Buddhism.
Every day, on the way to and from school, I walked past a small, swift-flowing creek.
Neither my brother nor I could swim, and my mother was petrified that we would drown in that creek.
Every day she would stand in the doorway of our house and wait for us to come home from school.
She knew what a magnet the creek was for adventurous kids, how my brother and I longed to throw down our schoolbooks, tear off our sarongs, and jump in the cool water.
Once, though, we got away with it.
We jumped in the water and Mother didn’t see us.
Almost immediately, I was trapped in a small whirlpool where the stream flowed under a stand of bamboo.
I flailed my arms and tried to stay afloat, but the eddy was pulling me down with a terrifying force.
Somehow my brother managed to grab hold of me and pull me out.
He saved my life.
That would not be my last experience of near-drowning.
To this day, even though I have traveled all over the world and crossed oceans countless times, I am still uncomfortable around large bodies of water.
One day, when I was perhaps nine years old, I was coming home from school with several other boys during a heavy rainstorm.
We had to cross a rice field, which had narrow dividers between the rows of rice plants, with irrigation ditches bisecting the dividers.
It was like a small river, with a swift current.
All the other boys jumped over the ditch, but I hesitated, holding my schoolbooks against my chest.
Finally, as I was working up my courage to jump, I slipped on the edge of the bank and fell into the water.
My books and slate were immediately carried away by the current as I struggled to keep my head above water.
The harder I tried to swim, the faster I seemed to sink.
My brother, Rambanda, jumped into the water and pulled me out.
I was scared and wet, but all right.
We never told our parents about it.
We knew what would happen if we did.
The Buddhist temple, which was about a quarter-mile from our house, was the center of our village.
Only one monk and his assistant, a layman, lived there.
The compound included a preaching hall, a shrine room, a little mud hut that served as a kitchen, and an outhouse.
In a corner of the courtyard stood a Bodhi tree, to remind us of the tree that Shakyamuni Buddha sat under when he attained enlightenment.
A brick wall surrounded the tree, to keep children from climbing its sacred limbs.
The temple was maintained by a board of directors and a willing force of volunteer labor.
People from the village cheerfully helped with construction, cleaning, cooking, and organizing celebrations.
Buddhists believe that such good works earn merit in this life and the next.
Most people went to the temple nearly every day, even if only for a short visit.
The daily rhythms of the temple also regulated our daily lives.
Every day at 6 A.M., either the monk or his assistant would ring a large, gong-like bell in the temple courtyard.
That was the signal for morning devotions.
It meant the monk had completed his hour-long meditation and now was going to the shrine room to chant devotional prayers.
Everyone in the village could hear that bell.
When it rang, we knew it was time for our individual rituals, too.
We would put fresh flowers on our home altars, light incense, and settle down to chant.
The temple bell would ring again at 11 A.M., when the monk was beginning to eat his main meal of the day.
That bell was our only way of marking time, as no one had clocks or wristwatches.
Every evening, Rambanda and I went to the temple.
We loved it there.
The monk let us play on the temple grounds and often gave us candy or leftover food.
We were not supposed to eat temple food, because it had been offered by villagers for the monk’s consumption.
Our parents had told us that eating temple food would cause bad kamma for us, that we’d be dragged into hell by that kamma.
But the monk was so friendly, and our hunger so strong, that we forgot about hell.
We eagerly ate whatever he gave us: boiled rice, spicy fish, cooked lentils, rice-flour sweets, maybe a ripe mango.
My father built the temple’s preaching hall, a thirty-by-thirty-foot building with a cement floor, brick walls, and a tile roof.
Inside was a square platform about six inches high, with four tall wooden pillars at its corners.
The only thing on the platform was a chair, surrounded by a wooden lattice and covered with a cloth canopy that was draped over the pillars.
On full-moon and new-moon days, laypeople spent the whole day and night at the temple.
Monks from neighboring villages would also come to our temple and take turns sitting on that throne and delivering sermons.
First thing in the morning, a monk would recite one of the Buddha’s discourses in Pali.
Because Pali is similar to Sinhalese, most of the laypeople could understand what he was saying.
The morning recital was short, usually only an hour, because the monks also had to perform a devotional service before their lunch, which was at 11 A.M.
In the afternoon, another monk would explain the meaning of the Pali discourse that had been delivered that morning.
Then the temple visitors were free for several hours to meditate, ask the monks questions, or read Dhamma books.
In the evening, a solemn ceremony unfolded.
After all the laypeople assembled in the preaching hall, a learned monk was carried in by two men folding their arms together to make a seat.
There weren’t many of these highly respected monks.
Some of them could recite the entire Pali canon by memory and knew all the commentaries as well.
They were usually renowned for their storytelling abilities and their sweet chanting voices.
The monk was gently lowered into his chair on the platform, then wrapped in a white cloth up to his neck.
A curtain was drawn in front of him, leaving only his face showing.
Other men came forward with tea for the monk, or a tray full of sugarcane candy and a chewing mixture of betel nuts, areca nuts, lime paste, and tobacco.
A spittoon was placed before him.
First the monk took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, the Triple Gem of Buddhism.
His voice was beautifully nasal, his chant hypnotically singsong as it floated out from behind the curtain:
Then the monk would administer the five precepts to the villagers, a traditional beginning for any Buddhist gathering.
He chanted the phrases in Pali, and the laypeople repeated after him.
After those preliminaries, the sermon would begin around 8 P.M.
Sometimes it lasted all night.
Children fell asleep on the floor beside their parents.
The adults, however, were supposed to stay awake.
To help them, an old man with a long white beard sat in front of the platform.
Every time the monk paused to take a breath, the old man said very loudly, “YES, Venerable Sir!”
Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night and find the whole room asleep, save for the monk and that old man.
It amazed me that anyone managed to stay awake.
Around 5 A.M., the drum-beaters began thumping a beat, and people would begin to stir.
At 6 A.M., the monk would open the curtain and stretch out his legs, which had been folded in the same position all night.
Several men would approach him, carrying a pan of warm coconut oil.
For fifteen minutes, they’d massage his feet and legs with the oil.
Then the monk would descend from the platform and retire to his room to wash before breakfast.
Watching all this as a young boy, I was deeply impressed.
The laypeople’s pious attitude and respect for the monk was inspiring.
I told my parents that I wanted to become a monk: I wanted to deliver sermons and be carried to my chair by reverent people.
Not only that, but I would teach Dhamma in English, I boasted.
My oldest brother had taught me the English alphabet, as well as a few English words.
Nobody else in our village knew any English at all, even though it was the “official” language of Ceylon under British rule.
We villagers were allowed to use Sinhalese, but English was clearly the language of the elite — those with government jobs, those in high society, those wealthy enough to travel.
So I thought if I could learn English, I would be the ultimate educated monk.
My parents listened to my childish dreams, and they laughed.
AS I GREW OLDER, my interest in becoming a monk intensified.
Before I became a bhikkhu, I loved pretending I was a bhikkhu.
I would wrap a piece of white cloth around myself, the way monks wrap their robes around them, and sit down under a tree in the forest.
I imagined that the other trees around me were people, and I preached to the crowd of silent listeners, reciting a few Pali stanzas I’d heard at the temple.
I would also sit and pretend to be deep in “meditations,” though I had no idea what meditation was.
Even then, I believed it was somehow my kamma to become a monk.
This is not to say that it was my “fate” to be a monk, for Buddhism has no such notions.
Rather, because of all the accumulated causes and conditions in my past, however long that may have been, I now wanted to be a Buddhist monk.
Perhaps I had been a monk in a previous life — not a totally successful one, because I obviously hadn’t achieved enlightenment in that life, but not a complete failure, either, because I had the good fortune to have been reborn as a human being, with another chance to better myself spiritually.
But even putting such notions aside, the impulse to ordain and that deep longing to wear the saffron robe flowered in me very early.
By the time I was eleven years old, I had lost interest in the boyhood mischief and pranks Rambanda and I used to enjoy, but I’d also lost interest in school.
I wanted only to enter the two-and-a-half-millennium-old order of Buddhist monks in the ancient Asian tradition.
Stories of young boys in the time of the Buddha who had had similar aspirations to become monks captivated me.
One such story was about a boy called Culapanthaka.
Culapanthaka was born at the side of a road as his mother traveled to her parents’ home.
In ancient India, it was the custom for a pregnant woman to return to her ancestral home to deliver a baby, and often the rigors of the trip induced labor.
Prince Siddhattha Gotama , who would later become the Buddha, was born in a grove of trees near a roadway because his mother, Queen Mahamaya, was on her way to her parents’ house.
Culapanthaka’s mother had two sons, both of them born in this fashion, by the side of a road.
Mahapanthaka often accompanied his grandfather to hear the Bud¬dha preach, and that inspired him eventually to become a monk.
Young Culapanthaka followed in his brother’s footsteps several years later.
Mahapanthaka wanted to teach his brother Dhamma, but found him to be a poor student.
Culapanthaka could not memorize one simple stanza even in several months’ time.
Mahapanthaka was very disappointed and thought it was wrong for his brother to continue as a monk if he could not learn Dhamma.
“You should take off your monk’s robe and go home,” he told his younger brother.
Culapanthaka was devastated.
He loved the monk’s life and loved being a disciple of the Buddha.
He didn’t know what to do, but he knew he didn’t want to leave the robe.
Not long after, Jivaka Komarabhacca, who sometimes served as the Buddha’s physician, requested that Mahapanthaka invite the Buddha and all the monks in the monastery to have a noontime meal at his house.
Mahapanthaka accepted the invitation on the monks’ behalf, adding, “By tomorrow, however, Culapanthaka will no longer be at the monastery.
Overhearing his brother’s decisive tone, Culapanthaka grieved bitterly, and with tears in his eyes, he packed his few belongings and left the monastery.
Here, I’ll teach you something that you can learn easily.”
The Buddha gave him a piece of white cloth and said, “Take this cloth and sit in the sun.
Put the cloth in the palm of your left hand, and rub it with your right palm, saying over and over, ‘Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.’”
Culapanthaka did exactly what the Buddha asked him to.
He sat in the sun, rubbing his right hand in circles over the cloth, repeating the unusual mantra the Buddha had given him as an exercise in mind¬fulness.
After a while he looked down.
The white piece of cloth had turned dark, stained by the oils in his hand.
Even though he had been chanting a mantra about cleaning, he had made the cloth dirty!
All of a sudden, Culapanthaka realized that everything is impermanent.
All that he loved, all that he encountered, all that he resisted, everything without exception was as impermanent as that clean white cloth.
At that moment, clearly realizing the impermanence of all things, Culapanthaka became enlightened.
He went to the monastery, sat under a tree and, using the mysterious psychic powers of a fully awakened one, created hundreds of monks exactly like himself.
Meanwhile, the other monks of the monastery had gone with the Buddha to Jivaka’s house.
The Buddha did not see Culapanthaka and thus declined to eat when the lunch was served.
“What is the matter, Venerable Sir?” asked a nervous Jivaka.
“Is something amiss?”
“Are you sure that all the monks in the monastery have come here?” asked the Buddha.
“Yes, Venerable Sir, I am sure they’ve all come.
Venerable Mahapanthaka confirmed that.”
“Nevertheless,” the Buddha said calmly, “send somebody to the monastery and see if any monk was left behind.”
Jivaka sent a man to the monastery.
The man returned very quickly, pale as a ghost.
“Venerable Sir, the entire monastery is full of monks!” he said.
“Some were meditating, some sewing their robes, some cleaning the compound, some fetching water, some walking, some reciting whole discourses on the Dhamma.”
Then the Buddha asked the man to go back to the monastery and ask for Culapanthaka.
And when he did, all the monks — hundreds of them — said, in one voice, “I am Culapanthaka.”
The man was dumbfounded.
He went back to Jivaka’s house and reported what he had witnessed.
Then the Buddha asked him to go back and catch one of the monks by his robe.
“If you do that,” the Buddha said, “the other monks will disappear.”
That was what the man did.
And he brought the one named Culapanthaka back for lunch.
When they finished eating, the Buddha asked Culapanthaka to deliver a sermon.
His brother, Mahapanthaka, and the rest of the monks were shocked.
Why would the Buddha honor such an inferior person, a no-good monk who couldn’t even memorize so much as a stanza of the teachings?
But Culapanthaka delivered a wonderful Dhamma sermon, taken directly from his own realization of impermanence.
Everyone was astounded by the depth of his intellect.
According to the story, in one of his previous lives he had been a very smart monk, but had laughed at a dull colleague who was trying with difficulty to learn a certain passage by heart.
So in Culapanthaka’s next life, his kamma came to fruition: On the one hand he could not learn one stanza in four months, and on the other hand he was able to attain enlightenment and supernatural powers.
Both were the results of his own previous kamma, good and bad.
A dual-purpose story: both inspiration and warning!
Like Culapanthaka, I was steadfast in pursuit of my goal.
I pestered my parents about becoming a bhikkhu long enough that they gradually began to take my request more seriously, as something more than a passing whim.
I was still too young to ordain fully, but I could live in a temple and train as a novice.
Many young boys did that, and many of those became monks when they were old enough.
It was considered very auspicious for a family if one of its sons entered the order.
When a boy ordained, all his relatives received the benefit of spiritual merit.
Even if a young man had already married when he decided to become a monk, it was no shame for him to leave his wife.
She, too, would acquire merit by her husband’s ordination.
So, with some reluctance, my father finally agreed to let me try temple life.
My father consulted the village astrologer to determine a lucky day for me to leave home.
In those days, astrology dictated the main events of our lives.
People consulted the stars for deciding when to plant a crop, when to marry, when to cremate the dead, when to cut a child’s hair for the first time, when to start an important job, even when to dig the foundation for a building.
Although astrological principles may seem contrary to the Buddha’s teaching of the kammic law of cause and effect, belief in astrology co-existed nonetheless alongside Buddhist practices, and no one thought this was a problem in the least.
On the chosen day, my mother cooked some milk rice for me.
That was a wonderful treat, made only for very special occasions.
When a child reads his alphabet for the first time, his mother makes milk rice.
When a child goes to school for the first time, his mother makes milk rice.
To celebrate a birthday or the new year, people make milk rice.
The first harvest of rice every year is used to make milk rice that is offered to the monks.
And, of course, it was milk rice that the village girl Sujata offered to an emaciated Siddhattha Gotama, after he decided to give up asceticism.
He accepted the refreshment.
It revived him to the point that he was able to meditate strongly beneath the Bodhi tree and attain enlightenment and then teach about the Middle Way.
While I was eating the milk rice my mother had prepared for my home-leaving day, I saw that tears were beginning to roll down her cheeks and my sisters’.
Rambanda also was trying to keep from crying.
As the time to leave approached, my father appeared, dressed in his best white sarong and shirt.
He told me it was time to get going.
I put on a white sarong and shirt, too.
By then my brother was crying openly, and suddenly it became very hard to leave.
Mixed feelings swirled into a knot in my throat.
I was happy at last to be going to a temple, but I felt very sad to leave my family.
The family gathered in front of the house to see me off.
I knelt before my mother and touched my forehead to the sand at her feet.
She stroked my head with both of her hands.
“May the Triple Gem protect you,” she murmured, her voice thick and choked.
“May all the gods protect you.
May you live long in good health.
May no harm come to you.”
And then she started sobbing.
I stood up and she kissed my forehead and gave me a strong hug.
My father and I walked many hours along dusty roads to reach the temple that would be my new home.
We had no appointment, and my father had not told the temple I was coming.
The stars said it was an auspicious day for my home-leaving, and that was that.
Late in the day we reached the town of Kosinna, in Rambukkana district.
The temple was on a coconut estate at the end of a dirt path.
The compound included a preaching hall, monks’ quarters, and a separate shrine room.
In the open center of the compound were several chairs and lots of flowering plants, as well as beds of betel shrubs, which yield the betel leaves that the monks chewed for their mild narcotic effects.
My father presented me to the resident monk, who was a small man about sixty years old.
I would later find out that this man had been married before he ordained, and had lived in a house at the edge of the coconut estate, and that he had a grown son.
My father stayed with me at the temple for about two hours; then he left.
I was very tired and wanted only to sleep.
Already, my home and my childhood seemed distant.
The next morning, the head monk gave me a book of basic Pali, the language the Buddha spoke and the one used in Theravada Buddhist chanting.
He told me I would need to memorize everything in the book to prepare for my ordination, and he outlined what would be expected of me.
I and the three other boys living at the temple were required to walk around the estate collecting fallen coconuts and stacking them in various places.
We also had to sweep, collect firewood for cooking, haul water, wash dishes, and do laundry.
Basically we were unpaid laborers — slaves, of a sort.
Our religious duties included picking flowers to be placed on the altar in the shrine room and attending devotional services every morning and evening.
The other boys cooked our meals every day.
My job was to go to the head monk’s former home and fetch special food prepared for him by his former wife.
Only he was allowed to eat those dishes.
The three other boys who lived at the temple were all older and bigger than I was.
These “temple boys” were not novice monks, as I would eventually be, but they had the opportunity to have a religious education by living at the temple and working in exchange for their room and board.
One of them was in charge of the betel shrubs.
The other managed the kitchen.
The third took care of the many dogs roaming the compound.
Generally, they did jobs that a monk was not allowed to do because of his vows, such as cooking or shopping.
This was to be my new life.
But I lived in that temple for only about three months.
One day I was in the kitchen washing a pot.
Two of the other boys stood nearby having a heated argument.
One boy threw a rock at the other and it hit me on the wrist.
My hand swelled immediately and was very painful.
I wrote my father a letter and told him what had happened.
Several days later, he arrived to take me home.
“I don’t want my boy at any temple where there are violent people,” he said.
He felt it was reasonable that a father might hit his son, but did not think this kind of behavior had any place in a temple.
I went back home with my father.
My mother and sisters were overjoyed to see me again, and it was wonderful to be back with Rambanda.
We all seemed to take up right where we had left off.
I spent most of my time running back and forth between my parents’ house and the house where my oldest sister lived with her husband and daughter.
They told me they would love to have a boy in their house, so why didn’t I come live with them?
It was tempting.
I loved them both very much, and my niece was like a sister to me.
And my situation, at that point, seemed very uncertain.
I was almost twelve and hadn’t been in school for four months.
But the desire to be a monk still burned in my heart.
I missed being in the robes.
So I asked my father to find another temple that would take me.
Several months later, in January 1939, my brother-in-law told my father he had heard of another temple, this one in the village of Malandeniya, looking for a boy to ordain.
It was called Sri Vijayarama, which means “prosperous and victorious.” My father and brother-in-law thought that Malandeniya was about six miles from our house, but they weren’t sure because none of us had ever been there.
I felt happy anticipation of my future as a monk.
At the same time, reflecting on my experience at the previous temple, I was filled with anxiety over going to live in another strange place with strange people.
This time, both my father and brother-in-law would accompany me on the trip.
As we left, my mother told my brother-in-law, “Please take care of my boy.
Since you live close to that temple, bring me reports about my boy.”
Then we set off on foot, as my mother stood by the house.
I kept turning around to look at her, and each time, she was still standing there, farther and farther away, until I could no longer see her — and it was longer still before the tears dried on my cheeks.
There was no road to follow from our village to Malandeniya.
We walked along a footpath that crossed rice paddies, small creeks, and rubber tree plantations.
Every once in a while, we passed through other small villages.
Each time we asked directions to Malandeniya, someone would send us a little farther along the way.
Finally we approached a temple compound that was surrounded by barbed wire.
We later learned that this was to prevent the neighbors’ cattle from coming in and eating the small coconut trees on the grounds.
At the gate, strips of bamboo covered the wire so that it didn’t rip people’s sarongs as they stepped through.
When we walked in, we were greeted first by a pack of barking dogs, then by a few boys, and eventually by the head monk, a man of medium height, with sharp eyes and a very long nose.
He smiled, showing teeth stained dark by betel nuts.
My father, my brother-in-law, and I immediately knelt in the dirt and bowed three times.
The monk motioned us inside the temple and pointed to mats on the floor where we could sit.
The monk’s name was Venerable Kiribatkumbure Sonuttara Maha¬thera.
The title Mahathera, “great elder,” signified that he had been a bhikkhu for at least thirty-eight years.
He was then almost sixty years old and seemed very friendly; he smiled often.
My father introduced me to him and told him that I would like to live at the temple and ordain.
The monk looked me up and down, then nodded.
It was that simple.
I had been accepted.
My father and brother-in-law stayed about an hour, chatting with the monk, and then left.
The moment they disappeared from sight, I felt a great wave of loneliness wash over me.
I longed to run after them and tell them I had changed my mind, that I wanted to go home.
I started to cry, and I couldn’t stop for hours.
Venerable Sonuttara consoled me, saying that at the monastery I would have a very good home and I would learn Dhamma from very good teachers.
Then he gave me a worn mat and a dirty pillow to spread on the concrete floor for my bed.
The shrine room contained a wooden platform raised on pillars four feet high.
Its centerpiece was a very old, very ugly Buddha statue made of clay.
Evidently whoever sculpted it had not been schooled in the special qualities of the Buddha that are supposed to be depicted in statues of him.
On one side of the scowling Buddha was a picture of blue-skinned Vishnu, one of the chief Hindu deities.
On the other side was a portrait of Huniyam Devata, a god revered even today by some Sinhalese for his viciousness.
Some people say prayers in front of this deity to invoke its power against their enemies.
Vishnu and Huniyam were strange choices for the altar of a Buddhist temple, and the cumulative effect of these three statues was unsettling indeed.
In a separate building, about twenty feet from the shrine room, were three rooms, all of them dirty and dingy: the head monk’s sleeping quarters, a guest room for visiting monks, and a storeroom.
The kitchen was reached by way of an open-air corridor.
There was a small area for eating, also very dirty, and a wood cookstove with three stones on top, where pots could be placed over the fire.
Behind the kitchen was an outhouse exclusively for the use of the head monk.
We boys were told to relieve ourselves in an open area at the back of the temple compound.
And whenever we did so, the neighbors’ pigs would come and clean up after us.
Just as in the first temple, I had many duties assigned to me.
I was to split firewood for cooking, bring water from the well, sweep the grounds, pick flowers for the altar, cook, wash dishes, and feed the dozen dogs and cats that roamed the temple compound.
Between chores I was supposed to be memorizing Sanskrit stanzas from books called Sataka, which literally means “one hundred” but generally refers to “one hundred verses composed in praise of the Buddha.” When we memorized all of one book, we moved on to another.
One of the Sataka books explains the hundred and eight names of the Buddha, another presents the nine admirable qualities of the Buddha, and so on.
The purpose of forcing young boys to memorize those stanzas was threefold: to teach us correct Sanskrit pronunciation; to introduce us to the qualities of the Buddha; and most importantly, I think, to arouse faith and devotion in our young minds.
Each evening, as we recited our day’s memorizations, Venerable Sonuttara would turn the kerosene lamp very low so that I couldn’t cheat by reading my texts.
If I made mistakes or hadn’t memorized enough verses, he would get angry and slap me.
His slaps were more like “teaching aids,” not quite the same as the violence that made me want to leave the first temple.
Usually, though, I did well at the recitations.
I seemed to be a quick learner, and my teacher was pleased.
Within three months, he announced that I had progressed well and was ready for novice ordination.
Venerable Sonuttara consulted an almanac to choose an auspicious day and time for the ceremony.
Then he sent word to my parents and invited twenty monks from other temples in the district.
The oldest monk in the district, Venerable Alagoda Sumanatissa Nayaka Mahathera, would act as preceptor and administer my vows.
The day before the ceremony, the temple was a flurry of activity as guests arrived and villagers from Malandeniya prepared food for the visiting monks.
Many of my relatives came for the big day, including my father, brother-in-law, and Rambanda, my dear brother.
My mother could not travel that far because of her back injury.
She was heartbroken she couldn’t be there, my father told me, and I was very sad, too.
At ten o’clock in the morning, everyone gathered on a ten-by-forty-foot porch of the monks’ residence.
Normally an ordination ceremony would have been held in the shrine room, but because so many guests were there, my teacher decided the ceremony should be in the bigger space.
I wore a clean white shirt and sarong.
My father walked with me toward the assembled monks, who were sitting on the floor next to a makeshift altar, facing the crowd.
I knelt before the senior monk, Venerable Sumanatissa, and bowed three times.
He told me to seek permission from my father to enter the homeless life of a mendicant.
So I knelt in front of my father and repeated the ritual of three bows, each time touching my forehead to the floor at his feet to express respect.
I remember my father’s solemn face looking down at me.
It is a traditional assignment given to all novices, reflecting the Buddha’s First Foundation of Mindfulness, the physical form.
In one of his key discourses, the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, the Discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Buddha laid out four subjects toward which we should direct attention: our body, our feelings and emotions, our consciousness itself, and the mental objects of consciousness.
If we really look at those four things with total, undivided, and clear attention, we begin to see that they’re all in flux all the time.
They move and flow, changing from one moment to the next, leaving no possibility to cling to any one moment’s experience.
Contemplating those four constantly fluctuating objects, we see the impermanence of everything manifest in our own being.
Moreover, we see that there’s no difference between ourselves and others.
We are, each and every one of us, a conglomeration of body, feelings, consciousness, and mental objects.
Understanding this, we become more magnanimous with others.
Jealousy and separateness fade, and are replaced by growing compassion and loving-friendliness.
But not for a twelve-year-old boy in the midst of his novice ¬ordination — all of that, of course, is still a distant goal on the day a novice monk receives his first subject of meditation.
The older bhikkhus might equally well instruct a novice to work with any of the other four foundations of mindfulness, but they always choose the body because it is very easy, even for the beginner, to perceive.
The body is, so to speak, right there, in all its lust-producing, pain-creating, pride-swelling physicality.
And as I knelt before my preceptor, I had only the dimmest idea of what I would later learn about that first foundation of mindfulness.
The senior monk dropped the locks of my hair into my open palm.
That was a signal for a junior monk to come forward and lead me out to have the rest of my head shaved.
The head-shaving ritual, symbolic of a monk’s giving up material and worldly attachments, is always done in private, away from the audience of laypeople.
Once my head was bare, I was sent to take a bath in the temple well, behind the kitchen.
Then I dressed in white clothes again.
When I reentered the hall, I was carrying a folded bundle on top of my head — my monk’s robes.
I knelt before my preceptor.
Chanting in Pali, I asked the Venerable to receive the set of robes I had, and to ordain me as a novice monk so that I would be able to end all suffering and attain nibbana .
Again, three bows.
I go to the Buddha for refuge.
I go to the Dhamma for refuge.
I go to the Sangha for refuge.
I undertake the precept to abstain from killing.
I undertake the precept to abstain from stealing.
I undertake the precept to abstain from sexual activities.
I undertake the precept to abstain from lying.
I undertake the precept to abstain from taking intoxicating drinks and drugs, which cause infatuation and heedlessness.
I undertake the precept to abstain from eating after noon.
I undertake the precept to abstain from dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, and visiting theatrical shows.
I undertake the precept to abstain from wearing garlands, perfumes, unguents, cosmetics, and beautifying the body.
I undertake the precept to abstain from using luxurious chairs and beds.
I undertake the precept to abstain from accepting gold and silver.
After reciting these things, I made the formal request of my preceptor that he share the merits I had earned by this act of ordaining: “Venerable Sir, please rejoice in all the merits I have acquired and allow me to rejoice in all the merits that you have acquired.”
Then I made three more bows to him and bowed to all the other monks as well.
Finally, Venerable Sumanatissa announced my new name: Gunaratana, “Jewel of Virtue.”
Now I was a novice.
There were towels, bars of soap, an umbrella — practical items useful to me in my new, simplified life.
The day concluded with a sumptuous meal.
I ate with the other monks, sitting on the floor.
It was delicious.
That day was truly a high point in my life.
Everything was perfect, except for one thing: My beloved mother was not there.
I missed her very much.
Two weeks later, I went to see her.
She was overjoyed to see her youngest son, now with a shaved head, wearing the burnt-orange robes of an ordained bhikkhu.
She spread a clean towel at my feet and, sinking painfully to her knees, prostrated before me.
Three times her forehead touched the towel.
It was a reversal of the day I left home, when I had bowed to her.
Now she was paying her respects to me.
It was a powerful and moving moment for both of us.
“My dear little monk,” said my mother, tears in her eyes, “you should never disrobe.
The monk’s life is the best for you.
It is the life of freedom.
Never think of disrobing.”
From that day onward, whenever I visited home, Mother repeated this ritual and this request of me, always saying, “Never disrobe, my son.”
After my ordination, life at the temple changed, yet it didn’t.
There were still religious texts to memorize, chores to perform, punishments to endure.
Meals were certainly different, though.
Now, according to the precepts, I could not eat solid food after midday.
Basically, we had one large meal a day.
It was collected by going on alms round in the village.
As the resident novice, that was my job.
Every day, after my morning chores, I left the temple at about 9:30 A.M.
A large metal bowl, about the size of a soup tureen, hung from a wide cloth band around my neck, its mouth covered by a cotton cloth.
My duty was to collect food to feed both the head monk and myself from each of the sixty or so houses in the village.
Villagers stood in front of their huts, pots of rice or dahl or vegetables or sweet cakes in hand.
As I walked slowly by, maintaining silence and avoiding eye contact, they would place a spoonful of their offering in my bowl.
The alms round is still practiced today in villages all over Asia.
It’s a beautiful sight — long lines of monks walking silently, barefoot, and stopping in front of laypeople’s homes.
The devout villagers bow as they place food in the alms bowls.
Not a word is exchanged.
This practice is an ancient tradition bringing to life the interdependent relationship of monastics and laypeople.
The bhikkhus, who are not allowed by their vows to cook food, receive sustenance from the laypeople.
The laypeople, by offering food to the bhikkhus, receive spiritual merit and support the continuation of the Buddha’s way.
But for me, alms round was always stressful.
I had to visit all sixty homes and return to the temple precisely at 11 A.M.
If I was just five minutes late, my teacher would refuse to eat.
Monastic rules specified that our meal must be completed before noon, and my teacher didn’t want to eat hurriedly.
So I rushed through the village, not daring to miss even one house, because that would deprive its occupants of the merit of offering alms food, and then they would complain to my teacher and I’d receive a reprimand.
There were many dogs in that village, and they were hungry.
When they saw a small boy carrying a bowl of steaming, fragrant food, they became aggressive.
I tried to fend them off with the umbrella I carried to protect me against the blazing sun.
But I was never very successful.
Sometimes I tried to run away from the dogs, but with a heavy bowl hanging around my neck, that wasn’t easy.
Invariably I would fall, spilling food in the dust.
The dogs would rush me, snarling and snapping.
Many times I returned to the temple with bleeding legs and a half-empty alms bowl.
Some of the villagers seemed to feel sorry for me.
This outcome was not at all something I would have wished for, but it was nonetheless what happened.
Every day after lunch, I helped the two temple boys clean the kitchen, then I left for a two-mile walk to a temple in the next village, where the head monk would drill me in Pali lessons.
I was able to memorize the verses easily, so this monk liked me very much.
Then, after my lessons, I would rush back to my temple for evening chores and devotions, a ritual of reciting the qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
After that service, we had tea and I studied some more.
We were usually in bed by 9:30 P.M.
The wake-up gong sounded at four o’clock the next morning.
Like my father, Venerable Sonuttara had a temper.
He used abusive language to insult me and the temple boys.
If we broke any rules or strayed from the daily schedule in the slightest, he didn’t hesitate to hit us with whatever he could lay his hands on: rocks, sticks, bricks, a broom, even a knife.
So I tried hard to follow the rules.
As soon as I got up at 4:00 every morning, I would begin to cook breakfast and heat water.
By 5:00, my teacher expected the water, so he could wash his face.
Then I had to pick fresh flowers and arrange them on the altar for morning devotions at 5:30.
Breakfast was to be ready precisely at 6:00.
Venerable Sonuttara wanted the dogs’ plates placed next to where he sat, so he could feed them with his own hands.
We could not eat until he finished, then we had to gulp our food in order to get to our next chores quickly.
After I was ordained a novice, I was allowed to eat near my teacher, but he sat on a chair and put his plate on a table.
I was nearby, sitting on the floor, with my plate on a low bench in front of me.
When I returned from alms round at 11:00, we went through a similar ritual of serving lunch and gobbling our own meals.
At 1 P.M. our teacher expected his tea on a special table.
Then I went to the other temple for my Pali lessons, returning no later than three in the afternoon.
By 5:30, the flowers and garden were to be watered and then I had time for a quick bath before evening devotional chanting at 6:00.
At 6:30, I was expected to serve the Venerable his tea.
At 7:00 I recited my memorized verses for him.
Afterward, I prepared his betel chewing mixture, to be served at 7:30.
Then there was final cleanup and bed.
On full-moon and new-moon days, we enjoyed a break from the routine.
Instead of manual laborers, we were hosts to the villagers who would come to spend that special day at the temple.
Most of them were elderly and could not read or write.
In most temples, monks would read Jataka tales to the laypeople and explain their significance.
Sometimes in the Jataka tales, the Buddha is some kind of animal; always he is a bodhisattva, or one who is in the preparatory phases of becoming a Buddha.
Because I had a fourth-grade education, I was something of a hero to the uneducated villagers who came to our temple.
They loved to listen to me recite the tales in my girlish, prepubescent voice.
One day I remember telling a story from the human life of the Buddha.
I said that after leaving his father’s palace and cutting off his hair, Prince Siddhattha became an ascetic.
He wrapped a length of yellow cloth around himself and collected food in an alms bowl.
One of the villagers listening, an old man who reminded me of my grandfather, said, “Little monk, I think you are wrong.
I think the yellow robe and alms bowl were not introduced to the world until Siddhattha became the Buddha and began his order of monks.”
I answered him: “Sir, the Sanskrit word for bowl is patra, which literally means any kind of container open at the top.
Certainly such items were in use prior to the Buddha’s coming.
They were commonly used by mendicants.
And the Sanskrit word for yellow cloth is kashaya vastra, which refers to any piece of yellow cloth.
Why couldn’t Siddhattha wrap himself in a length of yellow cloth?”
As I recall, my answer pleased the old man very much.
But not everything that took place at the temple was so lofty.
One day the temple boys, who were older than I was, invited me to smoke tobacco with them.
I did, and thus an addiction was born.
We could not afford to buy cigarettes, so we stole tobacco from the head monk’s room, where he kept a supply of it to mix with betel and areca nuts, for chewing.
We’d wrap the tobacco in scraps of newspaper and smoke secretly.
Every once in a while our teacher would discover us smoking and beat us for it.
But that didn’t deter us; we just became more and more careful about not getting caught.
One day after returning from alms round, I lit a small roll of tobacco in the kitchen and began to smoke it.
My teacher appeared, carrying a bucket, on his way to bathe in the well.
He stopped and looked directly at me: I was caught red-handed.
“I’m not going to beat you this time,” he said.
I swallowed hard.
My teacher’s anger was intimidating.
I knew there was only one answer to that question.
“If you see me smoking again, you should beat me as much as you wish,” I said.
But I didn’t stop smoking; I was thoroughly addicted.
A couple of weeks later I was caught in the act again.
Venerable Sonuttara beat me with his bare hands.
After that, he locked up his tobacco so we couldn’t get at it.
Again, we were undeterred and simply became more resourceful: We sold coconuts, towels, handkerchiefs, and rice, whatever we had on hand — usually gifts from laypeople — to buy our tobacco.
As I got nearer to my teenage years I felt stirrings of independence.
I was no longer so afraid of Venerable Sonuttara’s unpredictable rage.
His extreme punishments seemed unfair and cruel and I began to resent him.
I also began to feel that my education was lacking.
I was thirteen years old and I had only completed the fourth grade — an accomplishment in those days, but still not enough for me.
Neither my teacher nor the monk in the neighboring temple who taught me Pali had any formal education.
I wanted to learn more, a desire that would stay with me for my entire life.
The temple began to feel like a prison.
This was not the luminous religious life I had dreamed of.
One day, after lunch, Venerable Sonuttara went to take a nap.
One of the other boys decided he wanted an orange from the tree outside our teacher’s room.
He started throwing rocks into the tree to knock down an orange.
The noise woke our teacher.
He came out of his room, furious, and demanded to know who had been making such a racket.
One of the other boys said it was me, that I was throwing rocks.
And now suddenly I was furious, too.
I asked the boy, in very unpleasant language, why he was lying to our teacher.
Venerable Sonuttara turned on me.
He said I was disrespectful.
He said he didn’t care who had been throwing rocks and that because I was being disrespectful, I was the one to be punished.
He seized a broomstick and hit me over and over until I fell to the floor.
I could hardly breathe.
That was the last straw for me.
I started out the door just as my teacher and the other boys headed toward the back of the compound to dig a new latrine.
I watched them go, then I quietly went back inside and threw down my books.
I went into the room where the temple boys kept their clothes and grabbed a white shirt and a sarong.
Without a pang of regret, I took off my robes and put on the shirt and sarong.
Exhilaration rising inside me, I slipped out the front door of the temple, through the barbed-wire gate, and onto the hard-packed road.
I was no longer a novice monk.
I was free.
WHEN I DISROBED and left the temple, there was no question in my mind where I was headed: home.
First, though, I stopped at my sister’s house.
My brother-in-law seemed only mildly surprised to see me.
He had heard of my struggles and, smiling, he said, “It’s good that you left that place.
Stay here awhile, and I’ll find you another temple.” But I was afraid that if I stayed there, Venerable Sonuttara would come looking for me.
So I ran home to my parents’ house.
My mother was shocked to see me.
She asked why I had left the temple, so I told her what had happened.
She didn’t say much, just started to cry.
In the evening my father came home from working in the rice paddy.
I told him about the abuse I had endured at the temple.
I could see from the expression on his face that he didn’t believe me, but he stayed calm.
My brother and sisters all seemed glad to see me, but no one had much to say.
They simply accepted my being there.
We all seemed to know it couldn’t last, though.
It was taboo for a monk to disrobe.
It brought bad luck, even disgrace, to the whole family.
The next afternoon my teacher arrived at the house.
My parents, out of respect for the monk, didn’t ask him to explain why I had run away from him.
They pretended not to know anything about what had happened.
After a few minutes of casual conversation, Venerable Sonuttara asked me to return to the temple with him.
I looked at my parents, silently pleading for their help, hoping they would rise to my defense and say they wanted me to stay with them.
For a minute or two, no one said anything.
There was complete silence.
My parents seemed unable to look at me.
Then my teacher repeated his request.
My father nodded his head and said quietly, “Yes, you must go with him.”
My heart sank.
I knew that if I stayed, my father would simply force me to return to the temple the next day, or the day after that.
And I didn’t want to bring disgrace on my family.
So I left with Venerable Sonuttara.
As soon as we got back to the temple, he ordained me again, in a ceremony much less elaborate than the first one.
For the second time in my life, I put on orange robes.
I could only hope it would go better this time.
My teacher, as a member of the monks’ council, a governing body of our sect, had to spend the month between the full moon of June and the full moon of July in Kandy.
During that month, the council held higher ordination ceremonies for novice monks, sometimes conferring full monkhood on as many as thirty young men a day.
During my teacher’s absence I was to serve as head of the temple, even though I was barely thirteen years old and still a novice.
One day, while my teacher was gone and I was in charge, a man came to the temple asking for oranges.
We had two orange trees on the premises, so whenever villagers needed oranges they came to us.
He gave me a little less than one rupee, the equivalent of about twenty-five cents.
One of the temple boys had gone to Kandy with Venerable Sonuttara, so only the other boy, named Hinnimahattaya, was there with me.
So as soon as the villager left with his sack of oranges, Hinnimahattaya asked me for his share of the proceeds.
“He only gave me twenty-five cents,” I told Hinnimahattaya, “and out of that we have to buy sugar, tea, and some kerosene for the lamps for tonight.”
Another time, we had run out of matches to light the kerosene lamps.
I asked Hinnimahattaya to run to a neighbor’s house and bring back a burning stick.
That was very common in those days, to “borrow” fire from your neighbor.
But Hinnimahattaya refused to go.
So I threatened him: If he wouldn’t go get the burning stick, I wouldn’t give him half of my next cigarette.
But Hinnimahattaya was unpersuaded.
He was willing to give up his half of a smoke in return for not running the errand.
So I went myself, and when I came back with the burning stick, I used it to light a cigarette.
Eagerly Hinnimahattaya watched me.
As soon as half of the cigarette was gone, he asked me for the second half.
“Forget it,” I said.
“A deal is a deal.
I ran the errand, and so you don’t get the cigarette.”
Hinnimahattaya started to curse me.
Enraged, I pushed him up against the wall, held him there, and used the cigarette to burn both corners of his mouth.
It also happened that, during the Venerable’s trip to Kandy, several teenage boys from the village came to the temple and stayed with us.
We played lots of games.
Of course, as a novice monk I wasn’t supposed to be entertaining myself with games, but who cares when the teacher is not around?
One of our favorite games was called panca ganahava, which means “play with five.”
It involved tossing small seashells onto the floor and earning points based on whether the shells landed right-side up or not.
One day our next-door neighbor came over and said that he wanted to teach us a card game.
He showed us a game and got us interested.
He made sure we won several games in a row, then he said, “If you have money, you can bet on this game.
Today is your lucky day.
You seem to be winning.”
I told him I only had one rupee.
He said, “That’s good.
Let’s play for money.”
He encouraged me to play again.
Of course, that time I lost.
The neighbor pocketed the three rupees and left, smiling.
That was the end of my short gambling career and one lesson I learned in just a single try.
On the afternoon my teacher returned from Kandy, the very first thing he did was examine the bowl we used for offering food to the Buddha statue in the shrine room.
Our instructions had been to empty it each day before noon.
That day, the Venerable found it still full at one o’clock.
I was in the kitchen at the time, preparing tea for him.
He called me and I came out of the kitchen and started down the steps into the main building.
The bowl hit me square in the forehead, hard, and I fell to the ground, bleeding.
I still have a scar on my forehead, to this day.
Our teacher also noticed the burn marks around Hinnimahattaya’s mouth.
I had warned Hinnimahattaya not to tell our teacher about the incident with the cigarette.
If he did, we would both be in trouble for smoking.
Fortunately, Hinnimahattaya said nothing.
I told Venerable Sonuttara that the temple boy had cursed me, so I burned his mouth as punishment.
Curiously, he seemed to accept that story and said nothing more about it.
That was one of the rare times when I got away with something, though.
My teacher’s temper was uncontrollable and the beatings continued, often for the slightest infraction of the rules.
He was the dictator, and we had to accept his every command without question or discussion.
Yet for all that, Venerable Sonuttara did have a kind streak.
He had a real soft spot for animals; that’s why he fed all the stray dogs and cats in the area.
And if sick people came to the temple seeking help, he gave them free herbal medicines.
Occasionally one of the temple boys would run away, taking something of value with him, such as a brass oil lamp or even one of the Buddha statues.
“Let him go,” my teacher would say.
“He is poor.
He can sell those things and get a little money.
We can replace whatever he stole.”
In reflecting now upon my teacher’s behavior, I think that Venerable Sonuttara really did want to see me become a good monk and not be led astray by my natural adolescent urges for independence.
And he “encouraged” good behavior by using the normal form of punishment in those days: physical beatings.
Of course, I couldn’t see it that way until later, when I was an adult.
At the time I lived in his temple as a novice, I was miserable.
I chafed continually under his dominance.
At one point, I began to talk to one of the temple boys about leaving.
He was very unhappy, too.
Both of us were saving up money and hoarding candles, and we planned to run away some night.
One day we agreed to escape that night.
We both worked harder than usual that day, in order to please our teacher so that he wouldn’t suspect anything.
That night, after everyone in the temple went to bed, I removed my robes and put on a sarong and shirt.
My accomplice and I sneaked out the back door.
First we had to go through a cemetery, which unnerved both of us.
Then we found ourselves on a wooden bridge over a small creek.
We had heard the local stories that this was a place where wicked demons and goblins grabbed people.
The legend also said that the first sign of their appearance would be a big black dog.
Normally, if people had to pass over that bridge they would go in a large group, everyone talking loudly and carrying bright torches to scare away the demons.
But because we were running away, we had to be quiet and we couldn’t even light the candles we had brought with us, for fear someone would see us.
We crossed the bridge at exactly midnight.
We were trembling, dry-mouthed.
Our hair stood on end.
We didn’t utter one word to each other, just walked slowly in the pitch dark.
Suddenly, a big black dog appeared in front of us, and my heart began pounding even harder.
Then we were both slapped so hard in the face we nearly fell off the bridge and into the water.
It turned out that the big black dog was our temple dog and the slaps came from our teacher, who had heard us sneaking out the back door and followed us to the bridge.
On his orders, we followed him back to the temple, where I was immediately ordained a third time, in the middle of the night.
None of the other temple boys ever heard about that incident, nor did the villagers.
The next day, back in my bhikkhu’s robes, I took the alms bowl and went into the village to collect alms as usual.
When I was fifteen or so, I became interested in a girl from the village who was about my age.
Every day she would stand in front of her house as I came by with the alms bowl.
She was near my height, with long black hair.
She had a round face like mine, with skin lighter than the normal Sinhalese complexion, and a perfect set of teeth that showed whenever she smiled.
I thought she was beautiful.
One day, as she ladled rice into my bowl, we had a very brief, whispered ¬conversation — very much against the monastic rules.
That evening, when I went to our well to take a bath, I deliberately banged the bucket against the sides of the well to make a noise loud enough for her to hear at her house.
That was the signal we had agreed on.
Within moments she ran to the well, carrying a pot as if she needed to fill it with water.
I was thrilled to see her coming.
For about ten days, that was our routine.
I would bang the bucket in the well; she would grab a pot in her house and, if it was full of water, pour it out so that she had an excuse to come to the well.
Even though we were too shy to share our budding feelings for each other, we had long, lovely conversations, and each time, they got longer and longer.
I told her that temple life was like a prison.
We gossiped about other people in the village.
She told me about her life at home.
Eventually my teacher began to wonder why I was taking so long at my bath, and one day he came to check on me and caught us there, talking and laughing.
Of course he was upset.
Monks of any age are not supposed to have close contact with females.
He ordered the girl not to come to the well when I was there.
Back at the temple, he reprimanded me in very strong language and ordered me to take my baths later at night, at a time he thought would be too late for her to come to the well.
Actually, that suited me fine because I knew we would have even more privacy to talk after dark, when no one would see us together.
So we continued our clandestine meetings.
Inevitably, my teacher caught us again, and this time his rebuke was even harsher.
He told the girl never to come to the well again.
He said that he was going to report her behavior to her parents.
She cried and begged him not to tell her parents.
She promised not to go to the well anymore, and she didn’t.
I never saw her again.
When I look back on that incident now, after years of Dhamma study and practice, I see it as evidence that boys perhaps should not be ordained so young, as was customary in my childhood.
Then, when they have grown into adults, they can make a mature decision about whether to be ordained.
Joining the Sangha is a serious commitment, and I don’t think a very young person is prepared to make an informed choice about it.
And it would be a rare boy who was emotionally ready to cope with the rigors and restrictions of monastic life.
The traditional thinking in my country was that boys, with their vigorous young minds, could memorize sacred texts more easily than adults.
Their personalities could be shaped and molded early into the peaceful demeanor of a contemplative monk.
But now I’m not so sure that’s true.
I have seen plenty of men who became monks in middle or old age, after being married and having raised children, and they make fine bhikkhus.
And I’ve seen too many monks, on the other hand, who were ordained before puberty, continue to behave like children.
After Venerable Sonuttara cut off my budding romance with the girl at the well, my dissatisfaction with temple life deepened.
I was a teenager, with a mind of my own and a desire for a more formal education than this teacher could offer me.
My parents would be heartbroken if I disrobed again.
I couldn’t bring them into this shameful plan.
About that time, a father and son came to live at the temple.
The son’s name was Gunawardhena, and he and I became very good friends.
He kept telling me that he knew another place that was better than this temple, so we hatched a plan to run away together.
This time, I intended to do it right.
I would run away so that no one would ever find me.
On the chosen day I had the village barber shave my head as usual.
The whole day I was in a fever of anticipation; so was Gunawardhena.
At eleven o’clock that night, I went to the outhouse, and when I came back I left the front door slightly open.
At about twelve-thirty, we heard our teacher snoring.
We picked up several candles and walked to the kitchen, where I slipped off my robes and, yet again, pulled on a sarong and shirt.
Leaving the temple grounds, we headed in the direction opposite the one I had used in my last getaway.
As fast as we could, we ran through rice fields to the main road two miles away.
All around us were the sounds of nocturnal birds, frogs and crickets, and dogs barking in the distance.
Once we reached the road we slowed down to a walk.
Soon we saw two people holding lanterns coming toward us.
It was 1942, during the Second World War, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew had been imposed over all of Ceylon.
Nervously, Gunawardhena spoke to me, using not my ordained name but my lay name.
“Ukkubanda, those are policemen.
They’re going to ask us all kinds of questions.
What shall we tell them?”
In a flash I made up an entirely fictitious story: “Tell them my mother died yesterday, and that somebody came to the temple to give us the message.
We missed the bus to go to her funeral, so now we’re walking along the road, and are hoping to catch another bus in the morning.”
The policemen reached us and eyed me suspiciously.
I had a handkerchief tied around my shaved head, and another tied around my neck.
Because I had no belt, I was wearing another handkerchief around my waist to hold up my sarong.
The bundle of candles in my hand, too, was wrapped in a handkerchief.
“Look at this rascal,” one of the policemen said.
“He has ¬handkerchiefs all over him.”
Both of us told the same story, so the policemen let us go, not even mentioning the curfew.
All they said was to be sure to use a candle as we walked.
Within two hours we arrived at Kurunegala, about eleven miles from the temple.
Now we felt safer and were pretty sure Venerable Sonuttara wouldn’t follow us this far.
Just as it was starting to get light, we came upon a roadside shelter, one of many typical structures known as pilgrims’ rest houses.
The hut had low walls, a straw roof, and a dirt floor upon which people rolled out straw mats to lie down on.
Most of the time, these primitive, open-air huts were occupied by travelers resting in the shade and beggars cooking whatever food they had scrounged.
Gunawardhena and I were lucky.
Gratefully, we sank to the ground and were asleep almost immediately.
Several hours later, we woke up and washed our faces with cold water from a well.
We started walking again, not knowing exactly where we were going.
We just walked.
The scenery changed constantly.
We passed coconut groves, rubber and tea estates, terraced rice paddies, banana plantations, and small vegetable gardens outside one-room huts.
There seemed to be stray dogs everywhere, many of which had completely lost their fur, and more with numerous wounds from bites of other dogs or beatings by humans.
Often we saw wild monkeys swinging in the trees or running on the ground.
In the distance, every so often, we could hear elephants trumpeting.
There were occasional cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and rickshaws, all honking their horns to warn pedestrians and people sitting in the road.
But most of the traffic was human.
We passed men, women, and children simply walking or herding cows and chickens.
Some rode in primitive wooden carts pulled by oxen.
Along the roadsides were small mud huts that functioned as shops.
People sat in front of them, chewing betel nuts and drinking tea and gossiping.
Travelers could stop and buy tea, small loaves of bread, areca nuts, dried fish, ropes made of coconut fiber, and occasionally staples such as sugar, salt, rice, lentils, and kerosene.
Gunawardhena and I had a little money we had stolen from Venerable Sonuttara’s room before leaving the temple, so we bought a couple of loaves of bread.
On somebody’s land next to the road we saw a heap of coconuts.
We stole one and broke it open by smashing it against the ground.
The flesh of that coconut, and the bread, was our first meal on our journey.
We walked twenty-five miles that day.
Late in the evening we arrived at a town called Dambulla.
We were exhausted.
The next morning we woke to find ourselves covered with ticks and sand flies.
We went to a nearby well, and there, we broke sticks from a bush and started to brush our teeth with their fibrous ends.
A monk approached us, eyeing me carefully.
I tried to ignore him.
“No,” I lied easily.
“I’ve been sick.
I just got out of the hospital yesterday.”
“You don’t look like you’ve been sick,” he said.
“I think you’re a monk.
Come with me.
I’ll ordain you again, at my temple.”
I considered his offer.
I still had a desire to be a monk, deep inside me.
I had only disrobed because Venerable Sonuttara had been so cruel.
This monk seemed kinder.
But of course, I couldn’t go without consulting my friend.
I turned to Gunawardhena.
“I really don’t want to disrobe.
Here is a chance for me to be a monk again.”
They have no heart.
They only think about their rules and regulations.
Don’t be a fool, let’s go.”
The monk sweetened his offer.
He said that he knew some British officers at a nearby military airport.
He could get Gunawardhena a job there, he promised.
We could both live at the temple, and I could be a monk while Gunawardhena worked at the airport.
Gunawardhena would hear none of it, and I didn’t want to abandon my friend.
So we left the monk and started walking again.
The next day we ran into a man who said that he worked for a civilian contractor.
“If you want to work, come with me,” the man told us.
“We have plenty of jobs available.”
We agreed.
Our job turned out to be hard manual labor.
We were given two shovels and two bamboo baskets and told to collect sand from a creek bed, then pile it in large heaps for collection.
Our pay was 1.2 rupees a day, the equivalent of about fifty cents.
Out of that salary, the boss deducted about twenty-five cents for our meals.
Breakfast was a cup of tea with sugar, and dinner was rice with lentils.
We slept in hammocks made by tying a gunny sack between two trees.
The jungle was alive with mosquitoes.
They bit us night and day, and sure enough, before long, Gunawardhena came down with malaria.
He had a high fever and could not work.
I asked our boss for two days off, so I could take care of my friend.
He refused.
“I’ve worked for you for months, seven days a week, twelve hours a day,” I said.
“All I want is a couple of days’ break.”
Again, he refused.
Either I had to keep working, or both Gunawardhena and I had to leave the work camp.
“All right,” I said.
“Give us the rest of our salary.”
The boss paid us, and we left.
Thus began our life as beggars.
By day we wandered along dusty roads.
By night we shared other beggars’ meager meals in the roadside huts, telling jokes, singing, and dancing to pass the time.
For several weeks we didn’t bathe.
Our clothes were filthy and we smelled bad.
Every morning the other beggars would leave for “work” and ask us which area we planned to beg in that day.
“We don’t know,” was always our answer.
The truth was, we didn’t beg at all.
We just ate whatever food other people were willing to share with us.
We were lazy beggars.
Gradually Gunawardhena recovered from malaria and regained his strength.
Looking closely at my leg, I found a red blotch on the thigh about four inches above my knee.
One of the beggars sharing our shelter peered at the wound and declared it a snakebite.
The pain was excruciating, and I could barely lift my leg.
Gunawardhena and I stayed behind when the other beggars left.
After about two hours, I struggled to my feet and limped out of the hut.
We had barely walked ten yards when we ran into a man about twenty-five years old.
Neither of us had ever seen him before.
For some reason I couldn’t understand, he and Gunawardhena struck up an instant friendship.
They started joking and laughing like old buddies.
Probably Gunawardhena was feeling weighed down by me and my lame leg; he was relieved to run into someone who was more fun.
The three of us walked together, with me lagging behind.
Within five minutes, Gunawardhena turned to me.
We’ll wait for you in Lovamahapaya.”
I was immediately struck with fear.
Lovamahapaya was a six- or seven-hour walk.
“No, don’t leave me alone,” I begged.
“I can’t walk by myself.
I need your help.
Please stay with me.”
Then the incomprehensible happened: Gunawardhena ignored me and simply walked away with his new friend.
I sat down and started crying.
My leg was throbbing.
I couldn’t believe what was happening.
How ungrateful Gunawardhena was.
We had planned our adventure together, weeks ahead of time, and I had given up the monkhood to run away with him.
When he got sick in the jungle, I had given up the construction job.
All these months, we had been traveling friends.
We had depended on each other.
And now, when I needed him most, he had abandoned me.
I had no companion, no home, no money, no food.
I was at rock bottom, and I was utterly alone.
What in the world was I going to do?
FOR AN HOUR after Gunawardhena had abruptly left me by the roadside, I just sat there, alone and confused.
What had started out as the great adventure of running away from our temple had turned into a frightening ordeal.
I had a leg badly swollen from snakebite, I was hungry, and my traveling companion was gone forever, for all I knew.
Eventually, though, something inside me commanded me to get up.
“Keep moving,” the voice seemed to say.
So I got to my feet and started limping along the deserted road.
I walked for several hours until finally I came upon a girl sitting in the shade of a tree.
She was selling fruits, nuts, bread, tea, and vegetables.
I sat down on a rough bench.
I explained that a snake had bitten my leg the night before.
The girl asked me more questions: what my name was, where I came from, and why I was traveling alone.
I told her my whole story.
She gave me a piece of bread with lentil curry, and a good cup of hot tea.
Gratefully, I accepted the meal.
She went inside her tiny hut and came out with a piece of lemon.
She rubbed the lemon on the wound in my thigh, then massaged some oil into it.
She asked me to stay there until her father came home from work, but I said that I needed to get to Lovamahapaya to meet my friend.
I was hoping Gunawardhena might indeed be waiting for me there.
I started down the road again, still limping.
Pretty soon I arrived in the town of Anuradhapura.
One of the first places I saw was a restaurant called the Siyasiri Hotel .
The manager greeted me, then asked why I was limping.
I told him about the snakebite.
He asked why I was alone.
I told him how I couldn’t keep up with my traveling friend, so he had gone on ahead to Lovamahapaya.
“Everybody who passes through here comes to this hotel,” the manager said.
“Stay here.
If they come through this town, when they arrive you’ll see them.”
I agreed, and sat down to wait.
By 11 P.M., my head was nodding.
The manager could see I was very tired.
“You should stay overnight,” he said.
He gave me a straw mat to sleep on.
And that was the last thing I knew until eight o’clock the next morning.
As soon as I woke up, I asked the manager if Gunawardhena had arrived.
“No,” he said, shaking his head.
“Nobody came looking for you.
But you stay here, I can give you a little job.”
I didn’t know what else to do, or where else to go, so I accepted his offer.
And thus I became a waiter at the Siyasiri Hotel in Anuradhapura.
It was a pleasant enough job.
Several other young people worked at the restaurant, and we all got along well.
I waited on customers, cleaned tables, and washed dishes.
One day, several weeks later, I came down with a malarial fever and felt too sick to work.
While resting, I wrote my mother a letter to let her know where I was.
I felt guilty, knowing that she probably had heard the news of my running away from the temple, and that she must be worried sick about me.
A few days later, when I was back at work, I went to the nearby well to draw water for the restaurant.
Another boy was there, too.
I borrowed his bucket and used it to draw some water and pour it in my bucket.
As I handed his bucket back to him, the boy dropped it into the well, rope and all.
He started to cry, knowing how much trouble he would be in for losing the bucket.
But I had customers in the restaurant waiting for fresh water for their tea.
I had to hurry.
I told the boy that I would take my bucket of water to the restaurant, then I would come right back and help him fish his bucket out of the well.
But when I walked into the restaurant carrying a full bucket of water, my eldest brother, Tikiribanda, was standing at the entrance.
As soon as he caught sight of me, he demanded that I come home with him.
Mother was crying nonstop, he said, ever since she had heard the news of my escape from the temple.
My brother was almost as intimidating as my father.
I dared not disobey his command.
I forgot all about the poor boy waiting at the well for me to come and help him retrieve his bucket.
I forgot about the kind restaurant manager who had given me a chance to start a new life.
“I have opened a small shop,” my brother told me.
“You can come and help me run it.”
Later I found out that the day after Gunawardhena and I left the temple, Venerable Sonuttara had reported our disappearance to the police.
My father went to the temple and demanded my teacher find me and return me home.
By then, Father realized that Venerable Sonuttara was an angry, cruel man, and that my problems at the temple were not just due to my misbehavior.
My father knew that my stories of being abused at the hands of my teacher were not lies, but by then, of course, it was too late.
I had left the temple, and that time, I didn’t run home.
Meanwhile, police officers were combing the countryside for me.
My parents, especially my mother, were overjoyed to see me alive and well, but it was uncomfortable being in their house again.
All the neighbors called me “ex-monk,” which was a great insult.
My father didn’t want to have an “unlucky” son around; he asked me to reordain.
To keep away from Father so that we didn’t have to talk much, I kept busy at a series of small jobs.
One of them was digging flood-control ditches on a rubber estate near our house.
This estate was run by a large company.
They paid a meager salary, and the work was backbreaking.
I would fill bucket after bucket with soil, and then women carried the buckets to a dumping ground.
One time, one of those women saw the deep blisters on my hands from the shovel, and she offered to trade jobs with me.
So for a while, she dug the soil and I carried the full buckets.
After that job, I picked tea leaves.
That also was monotonous, hard labor.
I would have preferred to work at my brother’s shop, of course, but he had closed it only a couple of months after opening.
People in the village were too poor to support his shop.
Most of them couldn’t afford to buy even the simplest staples.
I spent much of my free time at my sister’s house, the same sister who had nursed me when I was young, the woman I called my second mother.
They were very kind to me and I felt more at home with them than with my own parents.
So a few weeks after I had returned home, I moved from my parents’ house to my sister’s house.
That was a more peaceful arrangement, but I still wasn’t really comfortable with the life of a householder.
My original desire to be a monk still burned within me, despite everything that had happened.
I began to think more and more about my teacher and the temple I had left five months before.
I felt regret for having run away.
My mind had softened toward Venerable Sonuttara, and I remembered his good qualities.
I thought that I should at least apologize to him.
One day, when my sister had gone to visit her dead husband’s relatives, I decided I would secretly go to see my teacher.
It was anovernight visit because of the distance, but I figured I could be back before my sister returned.
I knew she wouldn’t approve of this visit.
She wanted me to live at her house permanently and give up my dreams of being a monk.
As I was preparing to leave, my niece cried and asked me not to go.
I told her not to worry and that I’d be back the next day.
She continued to cry as I walked off in the direction of the temple.
When Venerable Sonuttara saw me he was relieved.
Even though he wasn’t always the kindest teacher, he wanted to keep me in monks’ robes as much as I wanted to be in them.
I apologized for running away, and he asked me if I was ready to ordain again.
“Yes,” I answered, certain of my decision.
“But I don’t want to live in the temple as a novice.
I want to go to monks’ school.”
He agreed immediately.
Two days later, after a simple ceremony, I was wearing the orange robes again.
This time, I would never take them off.
Because Venerable Siyambalangamuwe and my teacher were friends, he readily accepted my application, and in April 1944, a month after my most recent ordination, I began my formal monastic education.
I attended school at Vidyasekhara Pirivena .
About twenty young bhikkhus and three teachers lived there.
We studied Ceylonese history and important Dhamma texts such as the Anguttara Nikaya and the Majjhima Nikaya .
We also were taught a whole host of languages: Sinhalese, Tamil, Hindi, English, Pali, and Sanskrit.
I was very happy at my new school, living among other teenage monks and spending my days studying.
But I hadn’t been there long before Venerable Siyambalangamuwe came to me with a request.
He said there was a temple in the village of Napagoda, and the head monk had disrobed, leaving the temple with no one in charge.
He asked if I would go there and run the temple.
I thought this would be a temporary arrangement, that I’d live there for a few weeks and then return to the monks’ school, so I agreed.
As it turned out, I lived in that temple for eight months.
There were no Dhamma or Pali studies there, just the usual monastic chores, the weary round of endless labor.
One day there was nothing to eat.
So I asked the temple boy, a youngster about my own age, to go buy some bread at a shop in the village.
I asked him again.
He refused once more.
“I’ll ask somebody else to buy me some food, then, and I won’t share it with you,” I told him.
His response was to curse at me.
I kicked him several times.
Later that day, another monk who had been living with us for a time returned to the temple.
He happened to be the older brother of the temple boy.
He asked me what had happened, why the temple boy was no longer there.
When he heard my story, he got very upset.
“Well, since you chased off the only boy who was here to help us, it’s now your job to climb a coconut tree and get me a coconut.”
I refused.
“Monks don’t climb trees,” I pointed out.
“It’s against our rules.
And besides, my teacher didn’t send me here to climb trees and pick coconuts.”
After seven months of such frustration and petty disputes, my desire to learn made me so restless that I wrote to my teacher.
“Please send me back to the monks’ school,” I begged.
I was jubilant when, soon, I received a postcard from Venerable Siyambalangamuwe that said, “Yes, you can come back to school.”
I immediately hired an ox cart to take me to the train station in Veyangoda, four miles away.
I couldn’t wait to get back to Gampaha and reenroll in school.
When I got to the train station, I saw that the train to Gampaha didn’t leave for five hours, so I went to visit a temple nearby.
In that temple there was a young novice, maybe eight or nine years old, who took a liking to me.
He invited me to go swimming with him in the river next to the train station and I hesitantly agreed.
Although nearly seventeen years old, I had never learned to swim, but I was too proud to tell that to the young monk.
Little did I know that this single prideful act would soon threaten my life.
Pride, in the Buddha’s teaching, is one of the last of the five fetters that falls away when a person attains enlightenment.
It’s one of the twenty-seven mental impurities that the Buddha warned can trip us up.
To overcome infatuation with ourselves, he recommended a series of reflections a person should use:
I am of the nature to decay; I have not gone beyond decay.
I am of the nature to be diseased; I have not gone beyond disease.
I am of the nature to die; I have not gone beyond death.
All that is mine, dear and delightful, will change and vanish.
I am the owner of my kamma, heir to my kamma, born of my kamma, related to my kamma, I abide by my kamma.
Whatever kamma I shall create, whether good or evil, of that I shall be the heir.
At the river, the novice took off his outer robe and jumped into the water.
He swam like a fish.
I stood on the bank, admiring his easy, elegant strokes.
It didn’t look so difficult, but the last thing I wanted to do was jump into the muddy, fetid water.
The young boy saw me hesitating on the bank and urged me to join him.
Reluctantly I took off my outer robe and tied a knot in the folds of my inner robe so that it wouldn’t come off.
Then I held my breath, and jumped.
Within seconds I was in trouble.
My feet reached for the bottom, but all I felt was soft mud.
There was nothing solid to stand on.
I felt like I was sinking, and I started to struggle.
Panic rose inside me like an electric current.
My arms and legs flailed, and as I gasped for air, I swallowed the foul river water.
The little monk saw what was happening and tried to help.
I grabbed at his robe frantically, and in a moment it came loose.
Three times I went under, clutching that robe as if it would save me.
Three times I struggled back up, searching for help.
The last time, all I could see was the color red filling my entire field of vision.
I was losing consciousness.
WHEN I AWOKE, I was lying on the ground next to the river with a man kneeling over me.
I started coughing up river water as a large crowd stood around me and stared.
Later I was told that the young monk who had been swimming with me wouldn’t get out of the river because I had torn off his robe in my panic to stay afloat.
Naked, he had stood in waist-deep water at the edge of the river and screamed for help.
Apparently, a man came out of a tea shop next to the train station and asked what was the matter.
The young monk pointed to a spot in the river and said that I had drowned.
“He must be dead by now,” the monk had shouted.
He dragged me up onto the riverbank and started giving me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as a crowd gathered.
Eventually I sat up, coughing and sputtering.
I was a little shaken, but otherwise all right.
The young monk fetched his teacher, and together they walked me back to their temple, which was just fifty yards away.
They gave me a cup of hot coffee with lots of sugar, and a set of dry robes.
It was not long before I started feeling like myself again.
The head monk was very kind.
He asked me my name and where I was going.
When I told him, he sent an attendant to the train station to buy me a ticket to Gampaha.
After a few hours’ rest, I was on my way again.
Ironically, when I arrived at the monks’ school in Gampaha, the first person I talked to asked me why I sounded like a drowned person.
“I just have a cold,” I replied.
I was too embarrassed to tell the truth.
But the next day, there was my picture on the front page of Ceylon’s leading newspaper, along with a story about the teenage monk who nearly drowned in the river at the Veyangoda train station.
My fellow students at the monks’ school teased me about that for years.
Although tuition at the monks’ school was free, boarders were re¬quired to donate about five rupees a month.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have any money to pay the fee, so I was given an abandoned shed to sleep in.
I scavenged some gunnysacks, bamboo sticks, and ropes with which I fashioned a crude door and window shade.
For light, I had one earthen lamp that burned coconut oil.
This was my first kuti, the one-room hut that some monks live in, and I was delighted to have it.
I did most of my studying in my kuti.
Very quickly I became known as the smartest student in the school.
I discovered I had a photographic memory, clearly a gift of good kamma.
In ten minutes, I could read a long book and retain everything in it.
I don’t know how this worked; I just know that each page stuck in my mind like a picture.
I was very proud of my gift and asked my friends to challenge me by posing questions from books.
I could answer them with the page number, and even the punctuation, of the sentence in question.
Perhaps because of this, the principal of the school liked me and selected me to be his assistant.
I was also named treasurer, which meant that I organized and stored all the donations that came into the school — things such as robes, medicine, and toiletries.
Then I would dole them out to the student-monks as needed.
I filed report after report, detailing the wrongdoings of other monks.
I knew that I should be more concerned with my own behavior than with finding faults in others, but I wanted so much to maintain the approval of the principal.
It’s too bad that I didn’t take to heart the words of the Buddha, in the Dhammapada:
Easily seen is the fault of others, but one’s own is difficult to see.
Like chaff, one winnows another’s faults but hides one’s own, even as a crafty fowler hides behind sham branches.
He who seeks another’s faults, who is ever censorious, his cankers grow.
He is far from destruction of the cankers.
On full-moon days I gave half-hour Dhamma talks at the school.
Usually they were based on books I had read, but one time I decided that this might be boring for my audience.
So I decided to “wing it.
” All I did was memorize a three-page sutta, one of the Buddha’s sermons called Visakhuposatha Sutta.
Then I repeated it to my audience.
The experimental sermon was a disaster.
I was finished reciting within ten minutes, then I simply babbled on for five more minutes — about what, I can’t even remember.
From then on, I carefully prepared for each of my Dhamma talks.
I would choose a stanza from the Dhammapada and explain it using stories from the commentary.
The Dhammapada contains 423 stanzas, most of which teach about ethics and morality.
There are also hundreds of stories elsewhere in the Buddhist canon that illustrate the topics mentioned in the Dhammapada.
I enjoyed telling those stories, offering listeners a grounding in Buddhist morality.
It wasn’t until much later in my career as a monk that I again felt confident enough to give sermons without preparation.
At the monks’ school, at age seventeen, I was finally able to give up smoking.
It was a habit I had had for several years, but unfortunately, I only exchanged one addiction for another.
My new habit was chewing betel nut.
In time I became the comedian of the school.
Every night, I would hold court for an hour or so, telling jokes to the other students.
I enjoyed making them laugh.
One of my jokes was about a supporter of a temple who became angry that the monks there never shared any of his offerings with the Buddha image.
So he wrapped a rope around the neck of the Buddha statue and hung it from one of the rafters.
When the monks discovered what he had done and demanded to know why, he called it a suicide.
“The Buddha statue said it couldn’t continue living in such a place,” he told them.
Amazingly, the principal did not object to such irreverent comedy.
Usually, after my performance was finished, we went to his room and enjoyed a chew together.
He was a wise man when it came to dealing with teenage monks.
He was strict, but also very gentle.
He knew how to motivate us without forcing us, which might have destroyed our interest in learning.
He encouraged us to be disciplined monks.
“Laypeople will look up to you,” he would say.
“They know you have sacrificed sensual pleasure to devote your lives to the practice of Dhamma, so you must earn that respect.”
I almost never had any money, but it didn’t matter.
My humble housing was free, I collected my food on alms round, and instead of buying textbooks, I borrowed them from friends and copied the material by hand.
I simply trusted that I would have whatever I needed to finish my education.
I had a lot of confidence in myself and also in the Triple Gem — the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
I felt like the Buddha was alive and walking with me through life, providing me with whatever I needed.
I was certain the Dhamma would protect me because I was ardently struggling to learn the Buddha’s teachings.
And I thought that because I was a member of the Sangha, I would not have any problem getting whatever requisites I’d need.
Even today, so many decades later, it feels as though the Triple Gem continues to provide for me.
All satisfaction of my material needs seems to manifest eventually, without any struggle.
One day an older monk asked me to shave his head.
That was a common practice in the monastery, but I had never shaved anyone’s head, not even my own.
Both monks and nuns do it.
If monks and nuns don’t have to spend time washing, combing, and fixing their hair, they’re free to spend more time on spiritual pursuits.
The Vinaya, or monastic code of conduct, says that monks and nuns can keep their hair as long as two inches.
Some shave their heads only once a month, usually right before the full-moon day.
Others shave once a week, or even every day.
The ritual is so important that a straight razor is one of eight items included in a bundle of possessions that a monastic receives at his or her ordination.
When the older monk insisted that I shave his head, I bowed and agreed, as tradition demanded.
I wet his head, slathered soap on it, and took hold of the razor.
I was so scared I started to shake.
While I watched in shame and panic, that monk shaved the rest of the unfortunate fellow’s head.
We of course had no Band-Aids in those days, so the wounded monk went on alms round with a large dab of herbal salve on his head.
Because of my photographic memory, I sped through my studies.
Sinhalese, Pali, and Sanskrit were mandatory subjects.
Tamil, Hindi, and English were optional.
Without much effort, I mastered them all.
As a reward, I was finally allowed to live in the dormitory with the other students despite my continued inability to pay the lodging fee.
I was assigned to a room with another novice monk.
Unfortunately, my roommate was jealous of me.
One day I went to pull out a thin English textbook I had borrowed from someone and found it ripped in two.
I was worried about how I would pay for replacing the book and started to cry.
A monk in the next room heard me sniffling and offered to help by buying another book.
A couple of days later, my roommate confessed that he had torn up the book because he was jealous of my popularity and of how well I did in school.
We cleared the air between us that evening and eventually became good friends.
Eventually, the date of my higher ordination was set.
It would take place June 25, 1947.
I was very excited and happy.
Finally I would become a full bhikkhu, my goal at long last coming true.
Before a solemn assemblage of senior monks, I would pledge a new and deeper commitment.
Instead of being a novice monk following ten precepts, I would now agree to follow 227 precepts — the code of conduct that governs full-fledged Theravada Buddhist monks.
I could hardly wait.
Sadly, right from the beginning, there was a shadow over the proceedings.
The problem was not my eligibility to become a monk, but rather the politics of the Buddhist Sangha in Ceylon.
Those politics threatened to derail the dream I had held all my life.
IN SRI LANKA, there are three major sects of Theravada Buddhism.
The oldest and largest, to which I belong, is Siyam Nikaya.
This sect has more monks and temples than the other sects.
It also has the most ancient temples in the country.
Its name, Siyam, dates back to a time when the Sangha, or order of monks, had dwindled to its lowest numbers due to British rule in Ceylon, and because of Dutch and Portuguese missionaries.
There were many novices, but not a single bhikkhu left who had received higher ordination and was observing the 227 precepts — and thus could ordain others.
A novice Ceylonese monk traveled to Siam, as Thailand was then called , to receive higher ordination as a full bhikkhu.
Then he returned to Ceylon and reestablished the order of monks in 1753.
Only the highest caste members of society in Ceylon, called Goyigama, were allowed full ordination into the Siyam Nikaya order.
My family, though poor, belonged to this caste.
In Ceylon, caste was not based on wealth but on family lineage.
Years later, a group of non-Goyigama novice monks traveled to Amarapura, in Burma, and received full ordination there.
That group returned to Ceylon and founded the Amarapura Nikaya sect in 1800.
A third sect, founded in 1810 by monks who went to the Ramanna district of Burma, became the Ramanna Nikaya sect.
Originally there was a great deal of rivalry between the sects.
Each one thought the others were not strict enough in their interpretation of the Vinaya, or code of conduct for sangha members.
Siyam Nikaya monks, for example, shaved their eyebrows as well as their heads.
Members of the other sects did not.
On the other hand, when leaving their temples, Siyam Nikaya monks were allowed to leave one shoulder bare when they draped their robes around them.
Monks of the other sects covered both shoulders.
My teacher, Venerable Sonuttara, belonged to the Siyam Nikaya sect.
His teacher was a disciple of the sect’s supreme patriarch, Most Venerable Pahamune Sumangala.
In 1911, when he was twenty-five years old, my teacher was sent to open a temple in Malandeniya village.
Immediately there was trouble with the head monk at the temple in the next village, Kebilitigoda.
The temple in Kebilitigoda had already existed for ten years before my teacher arrived in Malandeniya.
Even so, the head monk became jealous of my teacher, so he made a legal claim to the new temple’s property.
As a result, my teacher had to pay tribute to the monk in Kebilitigoda and visit every day to pay respects.
As it turns out, that monk in Kebilitigoda was Venerable Sumanatissa, who had given me novice vows when I was thirteen.
He could have “claimed” me then as his student, but he didn’t.
Over the years, animosity festered between the two temples.
And when time came for my higher ordination in 1947, I ran headlong into the dispute.
According to tradition, when a novice monk is about to receive higher ordination, an announcement of the ceremony is sent to friends, relatives, temple attendees, and all other temples where that novice has lived.
It is printed on cheap paper and is mailed or delivered by hand.
The principal of the monks’ school wrote my announcement, and according to tradition, I took it to my teacher to have him sign it.
For some reason, Venerable Sonuttara was reluctant to sign his name as head of the temple in Malandeniya.
“But you started this temple in 1911,” I said to him.
“You built it and you have always been the only monk living here.
Who else could be head of the temple?”
Venerable Sonuttara said nothing and finally signed the paper.
I made copies and hand-delivered the first one to Venerable Sumanatissa, my original preceptor, at the temple in the neighboring village.
As soon as he saw my teacher’s signature as head monk of the other temple, he became enraged.
“Venerable Sonuttara is not head monk at that temple,” he thundered.
He immediately went to the Siyam Nikaya headquarters in Kandy and requested that my ordination be canceled.
My teacher and I were dismayed, but we continued to get ready for the ceremony, hoping the dispute would somehow be resolved.
On the night before my ordination, as was custom, the people of Malandeniya had arranged a large procession and reception at the temple in my honor.
Even though Venerable Sumanatissa was threatening to stop the procession, it went ahead without a problem.
The next day, June 25, we went to Kandy.
The ordination ritual would take place in the sima, a consecrated building on the grounds of the Siyam Nikaya headquarters.
On that day, twenty-six novices, including me, were scheduled to receive higher ordination.
Our relatives, friends, and well-wishers had already gathered in the sima.
As I had feared, Venerable Sumanatissa wasn’t going to let this pass.
He entered a formal complaint against my ordination because he, not my teacher, was the head of the temple in Malandeniya.
Therefore, my teacher had no right to sign his name in the ordination register as “head monk.
” Venerable Sumanatissa insisted my teacher sign his name only as “resident monk.”
My teacher, Venerable Sonuttara, was an uneducated man and was not clever with words.
He was afraid to oppose any monk who was his senior.
But most of all, he didn’t want this dispute to ruin my chances of being ordained.
I was angry at Venerable Sumanatissa, both for being harsh with my teacher and for trying to spoil the most important day of my life.
I found the politics of the whole thing appalling, but there was nothing I could do about it.
Without a word of argument, my teacher signed the register as Venerable Sumanatissa demanded, with the words “resident monk” beside his name.
A few hours before the ceremony, two senior monks dressed me all in white, with a crown-like headdress.
If a candidate has wealthy relatives or supporters, he might ride on an elephant, the symbol of majesty and status.
He might also have hundreds of people following, beating drums, blowing conchs and flutes, and dancing.
Because my family was not wealthy, my ceremony was more humble.
While I was being dressed, my relatives and teachers had prepared trays of gifts for members of the ordination committee.
Each tray contained betel and areca nuts for chewing, tobacco for smoking, a towel, a bar of soap, toothpaste, a toothbrush made from a small twig, and a box of cookies.
There were twenty dignitaries in attendance: the supreme patriarch of the Siyam Nikaya sect; his two assistants, who were also very senior and respected; a secretary monk, who maintained all records for the sect; and sixteen others.
Following a strict hierarchy, I was to go to each monk at his kuti, in turn, and present him with a gift tray.
This ritual took about an hour.
Even though it might seem redundant, every candidate for higher ordination is reordained as a novice and dressed in a new, bright yellow robe in the last hours before he becomes a bhikkhu.
This reminds the aspirant, once again, of Siddhattha’s renunciation of his princely life, wrapping himself in a yellow cloth when he took up the life of a mendicant.
It also serves to “wipe clean the slate,” in case the aspiring monk had broken any precepts during his novicehood and had failed to confess them to his teacher.
At 6 P.M. the ceremony began.
A rope divided the sima in half — one side for monks, the other for laypeople.
The laypeople’s side was packed with hundreds of noisy guests.
Children played with one another, babies cried, and adults chatted and laughed.
At the far end of the assembly hall was a large Buddha statue.
It sat on a dark wooden altar with peeling paint that was crowded with devotional candles and small earthen lamps, smoking incense burners, vases of flowers, and small cups filled with fruit juice, tea, or water.
A flat tray held the traditional betel chewing mixture.
A pair of large brass oil lamps flanked the altar, casting a sputtering light against the serene face of the Buddha.
At the right of the statue sat the supreme patriarch, flanked by his two assistants.
The remaining monks on the ordination committee sat on the wooden floor, in lines facing each other.
We novices were asked to sit on the floor according to our ages.
At six months shy of twenty, I was the youngest.
Twenty is the minimum age at which a novice may take higher ordination, but because I had completed all other requirements, I was allowed to ordain six months early.
The first order of business was an oral examination in which a senior monk would ask the novices, one by one, to recite stanzas and answer questions.
The examiner that evening was the second-ranking monk, a man known to be very strict.
His method was to recite the first line of a stanza from the Buddhist texts, then ask the candidate to finish it.
Most of the other novices had memorized the minimum number of stanzas required.
I, with my photographic memory and eagerness to excel, had memorized many more.
Even so, I was nervous in front of the large crowd.
Finally, after twenty-five other novices, my turn came.
The examiner had been at work for an hour and a half and he looked exhausted.
He asked me to recite a stanza from the Dhammapada.
I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and recited eight stanzas without stopping.
“That is enough,” the examiner said.
“You have studied well.”
Next, each of the novices had to be formally accepted as candidates for ordination.
Like the others before me, I got up and stood in front of one of the committee monks.
Methodically, he questioned me: my name; my gender; my parents’ names; my teacher’s name; whether I had any contagious diseases; whether I was a soldier or a free man; and even a question about whether I was human or demon.
While mostly a formality, these questions were intended to confirm that I was not a criminal trying to escape the law by hiding in the robe.
The question about contagious diseases was to make sure that I had no illness that might sweep through the community of monks.
The other questions, more quaint, were traditional queries dating back to the time of the Buddha.
After I answered all his questions, this monk announced to the supreme patriarch that I was a suitable candidate for ordination.
I knelt before the patriarch and bowed, touching my head to the floor in front of him three times.
Again I answered the series of questions, this time with the patriarch listening.
Then I was told to sit with my fellow novices.
Two monks lectured us on the importance of the 227 disciplinary rules we would have to follow after our ordination, emphasizing the four main rules: not to have sexual intercourse; not to take anything not explicitly given to us; not to kill; and not to boast of supernatural attainments.
There was also a reminder about cultivating nonattachment to the four requisites provided by laypeople: robes, food, lodging, and medicine.
All this advice came from the original words of the Buddha to his disciples.
Finally, with our new alms bowls hanging from cords around our necks, we bowed before each of the committee members, starting with the patriarch.
Then we sat down in long rows, and all the laypeople filed by to present us with gifts.
It emphasizes the interdependent relationship between the monastic Sangha and laypeople.
Many people cried as they bowed and laid their gifts before us.
This presentation of offerings is one of the most beautiful aspects of Buddhism and is sometimes misunderstood by outside observers who conclude that bhikkhus are lazy beggars, supported by a gullible populace.
In fact, it is quite the opposite: The givers receive as much, if not more, than the recipients because they are practicing dana, or generosity.
Anyone who gives gifts is practicing generosity.
The Buddha found this practice to be a good method for removing greed and attachment.
In many of his discourses, he urged Buddhists to practice dana whenever and wherever possible:
Just as a pot filled with water,
If overturned by anyone,
Pours out all its water
And does not hold any back.
Even so, when you see those in need,
Whether low, middle, or high,
Then give like the overturned pot,
Holding nothing back.
In another sermon, the Buddha taught that there are three ways of making merit.
Those three ways are virtuous behavior, meditation, and generosity.
The expression of generosity between laypeople and monastics is very much a reciprocal arrangement.
The laypeople offer requisites that allow the bhikkhus to walk their spiritual path without having to worry about mundane necessities.
In return, the monastics offer blessings, as well as teachings — the gift of the Dhamma.
During my ordination, as the gifts slowly piled up on the floor before me, I sat there and thought of my mother.
But because of her back injury, she couldn’t walk the nine miles from our village, and there was no other way for her to make the trip.
If she had been there that day in Kandy, she would have surely shed tears of joy, seeing her youngest son at last become a fully ordained monk.
Editor's Introduction
In the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive’s first book, Lama Yeshe’s Becoming Your Own Therapist , I mentioned the unique qualities of Lama Yeshe’s teachings.
Make Your Mind an Ocean again makes evident just how special Lama’s teachings were.
I had the great honor of accompanying the Lamas on this tour and was present at all these discourses.
Most of the people who attended were new to Buddhism and had never seen a Tibetan lama before, a situation quite different from what we find today.
As ever, Lama’s timeless wisdom shines through, and his teachings are as relevant today as they were back then.
The latter started a bit late, so there was no time to finish with the usual question and answer session that Lama liked so much.
But of greatest interest, perhaps, is “A Buddhist Approach to Mental Illness.”
Here Lama met with a group of psychiatrists at Prince Henry’s Hospital, which was at that time a teaching hospital connected with Monash University Medical School.
Prior to that it had been affiliated with Melbourne University, and Prince Henry’s was where I studied my clinical medicine and worked for several years after graduation.
The hospital was demolished a few years ago;
the last time I drove by it was but a hole in the ground, a symbol of how much has changed since those halcyon days.
Anyway, these doctors were delighted to meet and question Lama, and this historic exchange underscores the difference between Western and Buddhist concepts of mental health.
I would like to thank Rand Engel, Victoria Fremont, Christina Russo and Wendy Cook for their excellent editorial input, and Garrett Brown and Jennifer Martin for their help with the design and production of this booklet.
The way we live, the way we think—everything is dedicated to material pleasure .
We consider sense objects to be of utmost importance and materialistically devote ourselves to whatever makes us happy, famous or popular.
As a result, we are always up and down .
It is not our body that goes up and down, it’s our mind—this mind whose way of functioning we do not understand .
Therefore, sometimes we have to examine ourselves—not just our body, but our mind.
After all, it is our mind that is always telling us what to do.
We have to know our own psychology, or, in religious terminology, perhaps, our inner nature.
Anyway, no matter what we call it, we have to know our own mind.
Don’t think that examining and knowing the nature of your mind is just an Eastern trip.
That’s a wrong conception.
It’s your trip.
You think you are an independent person, free to travel the world, enjoying everything.
I’m not saying that you are under the control of someone else.
It’s your own uncontrolled mind, your own attachment, that oppresses you.
If you discover how you oppress yourself, your uncontrolled mind will disappear.
Knowing your own mind is the solution to all your problems.
One day the world looks so beautiful; the next day it looks terrible.
It’s your mind that causes these appearances.
This is not religious dogma; your up and down is not religious dogma.
I’m not talking about religion; I’m talking about the way you lead your daily life, which is what sends you up and down.
I hope you understand that.
Similarly, one person thinks that the world is beautiful and people are wonderful and kind, while another thinks that everything and everyone are horrible.
You think, “Today is like this, tomorrow is like that; this man is like this; that woman is like that”.
Do not expect material objects to satisfy you or to make your life perfect; it’s impossible.
Satisfaction comes from the mind.
If you don’t know your own psychology, you might ignore what’s going on in your mind until it breaks down and you go completely crazy.
People go mad through lack of inner wisdom, through their inability to examine their own mind.
They cannot explain themselves to themselves; they don’t know how to talk to themselves.
Thus they are constantly preoccupied with all these external objects, while within, their mind is running down until it finally cracks.
They are ignorant of their internal world, and their minds are totally unified with ignorance instead of being awake and engaged in self-analysis.
Examine your own mental attitudes.
Become your own therapist.
You are intelligent; you know that material objects alone cannot bring you satisfaction, but you don’t have to embark on some emotional, religious trip to examine your own mind.
Some people think that they do; that this kind of self-analysis is something spiritual or religious.
It’s not necessary to classify yourself as a follower of this or that religion or philosophy, to put yourself into some religious category.
But if you want to be happy, you have to check the way you lead your life.
Your mind is your religion.
When you check your mind, do not rationalize or push.
Do not be upset when problems arise.
Just be aware of them and where they come from; know their root.
Introduce the problem to yourself:
When you check thoroughly, the problem will automatically disappear
You can’t reject your mind.
You can say, “I reject Eastern things”—I agree.
Therefore, treat yourself wisely and try to discover the true source of satisfaction.
When you were a child you loved and craved ice-cream, chocolate and cake, and thought, “When I grow up, I’ll have all the ice-cream, chocolate and cake I want; then I’ll be happy”
Now you have as much ice-cream, chocolate and cake as you want, but you’re bored.
You decide that since this doesn’t make you happy you’ll get a car, a house, television, a husband or wife—then you’ll be happy.
Now you have everything, but your car is a problem, your house is a problem, your husband or wife is a problem, your children are a problem.
Examine your life from childhood to the present.
You know your way around the city, how to get home, where to buy chocolate, but still you are lost—you can’t find your goal.
You don’t have to believe in anything.
It is sufficient to know the nature of all that; that alone can bring you happiness and peace.
Thus, your life can change completely; everything turns upside down.
What you once interpreted as horrible can become beautiful.
If I told you that all you were living for was chocolate and ice-cream, you’d think I was crazy.
But look deeper into your life’s purpose.
I’m not exaggerating—check for yourself, then you’ll see
Through thorough examination you can realize that dedicating your entire life to seeking happiness through chocolate and ice-cream completely nullifies the significance of your having been born human.
Birds and dogs have similar aims.
Shouldn’t your goals in life be higher than those of dogs and chickens?.
I’m not trying to decide your life for you, but you check up.
It’s better to have an integrated life than to live in mental disorder.
An disorderly life is not worthwhile, beneficial to neither yourself nor others.
I’m an educated person."
But education also comes from the mind.
Without the mind there’s no philosophy, no doctrine, no university subjects.
All these things are mind-made.
Observe what feelings—comfortable or uncomfortable—arise.
It’s very simple.
When you check your own mind properly, you stop blaming others for your problems.
You recognize that your mistaken actions come from your own defiled, deluded mind.
When you are preoccupied with external, material objects, you blame them and other people for your problems.
Projecting that deluded view onto external phenomena makes you miserable.
When you begin to realize your wrong-conception view, you begin to realize the nature of your own mind and to put an end to your problems forever.
Whenever you are going to do anything, you first check it out and then make your decision.
You already do this;
I’m not suggesting anything new
The difference is that you don’t do it enough.
You have to do more checking.
This doesn’t mean sitting alone in some corner contemplating your navel—you can be checking your mind all the time, even while talking or working with other people.
Realize that the nature of your mind is different from that of the flesh and bone of your physical body.
Your mind is like a mirror, reflecting everything without discrimination.
If you have understanding-wisdom, you can control the kind of reflection that you allow into the mirror of your mind.
If you totally ignore what is happening in your mind, it will reflect whatever garbage it encounters—things that make you psychologically sick.
Your checking-wisdom should distinguish between reflections that are beneficial and those that bring psychological problems.
Eventually, when you realize the true nature of subject and object, all your problems will vanish.
Some people think they are religious, but what is religious?
Just the idea that you are religious—”I am Buddhist, Jewish, whatever”—does not help at all
It does not help you; it does not help others.
In order to really help others, you need to gain knowledge-wisdom.
The greatest problems of humanity are psychological, not material.
From birth to death, people are continuously under the control of their mental sufferings.
Some people never keep watch on their minds when things are going well, but when something goes wrong—an accident or some other terrible experience—they immediately say, “God, please help me.”
In happiness or sorrow, a serious practitioner maintains constant awareness of God and one’s own nature.
You’re not being realistic or even remotely religious if, when you are having a good time, surrounded by chocolate and preoccupied by worldly sense pleasures, you forget yourself, and turn to God only when something awful happens.
No matter which of the many world religions we consider, their interpretation of God or Buddha and so forth is simply words and mind; these two alone.
Therefore, words don’t matter so much.
What you have to realize is that everything—good and bad, every philosophy and doctrine—comes from mind.
The mind is very powerful.
Therefore, it requires firm guidance.
A powerful jet plane needs a good pilot; the pilot of your mind should be the wisdom that understands its nature.
In that way, you can direct your powerful mental energy to benefit your life instead of letting it run about uncontrollably like a mad elephant, destroying yourself and others.
I don’t need to say much more.
I think you understand what I’m talking about.
At this point a little dialog would be more useful.
Ask questions; I’ll try to answer.
Remember that you don’t have to agree with what I say.
You have to understand my attitude, my mind.
If you don’t like what I’ve been saying, please contradict me.
I like people to argue with me.
I’m not a dictator: “You people should do this; you people should do that.”
I can’t tell you what to do.
I make suggestions; what I want is for you to check up.
If you do that, I’ll be satisfied.
So tell me if you disagree with what I’ve said.
A simple way of checking up on your own mind is to investigate how you perceive things, how you interpret your experiences.
Why do you have so many different feelings about your boyfriend even during the course of one day?
In the morning you feel good about him, in the afternoon, kind of foggy; why is that?
That’s the way to check.
First, check up.
Don’t act without knowing what’s in store for you.
What’s a lama?.
Good question.
From the Tibetan point of view, a lama is someone who is extremely well educated in the internal world and knows not only the present mind but also the past and the future.
Psychologically speaking, a lama can see where he has come from and where he’s going.
He also has the power to control himself and the ability to offer psychological advice to others.
Tibetans would consider anyone like that to be a lama.
What would be the equivalent of a lama in the West?.
I don’t know that we have the exact equivalent here.
It could be some kind of combination of priest, psychologist and doctor.
But as I just said, a lama has realized the true nature of his own and others’ minds and can offer perfect solutions to others’ mental problems.
I’m not criticizing them, but I doubt that many Western psychologists have the same degree of understanding of the mind or the emotional problems that people experience.
Sometimes they offer somewhat poor quality, superficial explanations for the problems people are going through, such as, “When you were a child your mother did this, your father did that”.
I disagree; it’s not true.
You can’t blame your parents for your problems like that.
Of course, environmental factors can contribute to difficulties, but the principal cause is always within you; the basic problem is never outside.
I don’t know, but perhaps Western doctors are too afraid to interpret things in this way.
Also, I have met many priests, some of whom are my friends, but they tend not to deal too much with the here and now.
Instead of focusing on practical ways of coping with everyday uncertainties, they emphasize religious considerations such as God, faith and so forth.
But people today tend to be skeptical and often reject the help that some priests can offer.
How does meditation help you make decisions?.
Meditation works because it is not a method that requires you to believe in something but rather one that you can put into action for yourself.
You check, or watch, your own mind.
If someone’s giving you a hard time and your ego starts to hurt, instead of reacting, just take a look at what’s going on.
Think of how sound is simply coming out of the other person’s mouth, entering your ear, and causing pain in your heart.
By practicing in this way, you will discover through your own experience how meditation helps and how it offers satisfactory solutions to all your problems.
Lama, could you please talk a little about karma.
Sure: you are karma.
It’s that simple.
Actually, karma is a Sanskrit word that, roughly translated, means cause and effect.
Or, your environment: you have certain parents, you live in a certain situation, all that has an effect on you.
As you go through life, every day, everything you do, all the time, within your mind there’s a constant chain of cause and reaction, cause and reaction; that’s karma.
As long as you’re in your body, interacting with the sense world, discriminating this is good, that is bad, your mind is automatically creating karma, cause and effect.
Karma is not just theoretical philosophy, it’s science, Buddhist science.
Karma explains how life evolves; form and feeling, color and sensation, discrimination; your entire life, what you are, where you come from, how you keep going, your relationship with your mind.
Karma is Buddhism’s scientific explanation of evolution.
So, even though karma is a Sanskrit word, actually, you are karma, your whole life is controlled by karma, you live within the energy field of karma.
Your energy interacts with another energy, then another, and another, and that’s how your entire life unfolds.
Physically, mentally, it’s all karma.
Therefore, karma isn’t something you have to believe in.
Because of the characteristic nature of your mind and body, you are constantly circling through the six realms of cyclic existence, whether you believe in karma or not.
It’s the same thing in your internal universe, especially when you’re in contact with the sense world; you’re constantly reacting.
You remember your previous experience of chocolate; that memory causes you to crave and grasp for more.
That reaction to your previous experience is karma; the experience is the cause, the missing is the result.
It’s actually quite simple.
What is your purpose in life?.
I can’t say that I’m succeeding in any of this, but those are my aims.
Philosophically, the soul can be interpreted in a number of ways.
In Christianity and Hinduism, the soul is different from the mind and is considered to be something permanent and self-existent.
In my opinion, there’s no such thing.
In Buddhist terminology, the soul, mind or whatever you call it is ever-changing, impermanent.
I don’t really make a distinction between mind and soul, but within yourself you can’t find anything that’s permanent or self-existent.
With respect to mental problems, don’t think that the mind is totally negative; it’s the uncontrolled mind that causes problems.
If you develop the right kind of wisdom and thereby recognize the nature of the uncontrolled mind, it will automatically disappear.
But until you do, the uncontrolled mind will completely dominate you.
I’ve heard many times that many Westerners can grasp the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism intellectually but have difficulty in putting it into practice.
It makes sense to them but they can’t integrate it with their lives.
What do you think the block is?
That’s a great question, thank you.
Tibetan Buddhism teaches you to overcome your dissatisfied mind, but to do that you have to make an effort.
To put our techniques into your own experience, you have to go slowly, gradually.
You can’t just jump right in the deep end.
It takes time and we expect you to have trouble at first.
But if you take it easy it gets less and less difficult as time goes by.
What is our mind’s true nature and how do we go about recognizing it?.
There are two aspects to our mind’s nature, the relative and the absolute.
The relative is the mind that perceives and functions in the sense world.
We also call that mind dualistic and because of what I describe as its “that-this” perception, it is totally agitated in nature.
However, by transcending the dualistic mind, you can unify your view.
At that time you realize the absolute true nature of the mind, which is totally beyond the duality.
In dealing with the sense world in our normal, everyday, mundane life, two things always appear.
The appearance of two things always creates a problem.
It’s like children—one alone is OK, two together always make trouble.
Similarly, as our five senses interpret the world and supply dualistic information to our mind, our mind grasps at that view, and that automatically causes conflict and agitation.
This is the complete opposite of the experience of inner peace and freedom.
Therefore, by reaching beyond that you will experience perfect peace.
Now, this is just a short reply to what you asked and perhaps it’s unsatisfactory, because it’s a big question.
What I’ve said is merely a simple introduction to a profound topic.
However, if you have some background in this subject, my answer might satisfy you.
When you check your mind, does it always tell you the truth?.
No, not necessarily.
Sometimes your wrong conceptions answer.
You shouldn’t listen to them.
Instead, you have to tell yourself, I’m not satisfied with what that mind says; I want a better answer.
You have to keep checking more and more deeply until your wisdom responds.
But it’s good to question; if you don’t ask questions, you’ll never get any answers.
If you have a question, write it down; think about it carefully.
If you don’t get an answer today, stick the question on your fridge.
If you question strongly, answers will come, sometimes even in dreams.
Don’t think that you’re hopelessly ignorant.
Human nature has both positive and negative aspects.
What is your definition of a guru?
A guru is a person who can really show you the true nature of your mind and who knows the perfect remedies for your psychological problems.
Someone who doesn’t know his own mind can never know others’ minds and therefore cannot be a guru.
Such a person can never solve other people’s problems.
You have to be extremely careful before taking someone on as a guru; there are many impostors around.
This can really get you into trouble.
I’ve heard of many cases of people being taken in by charlatans.
Westerners tend to believe too easily.
Eastern people are much more skeptical.
Take your time; relax; check up.
Does humility always accompany wisdom?.
It’s good to be as humble as possible.
If you can act with both humility and wisdom all the time, your life will be wonderful.
You will respect everybody.
Could someone who makes a statement like that be wise?.
Well, it’s hard to say, just like that.
The point is to be as careful as you can.
Our minds are funny.
Sometimes we are skeptical of things that are really worthwhile and completely accepting of things that we should avoid.
Try to avoid extremes and follow the middle way, checking with wisdom wherever you go.
That’s the most important thing.
Why is there this difference between Easterners and Westerners that you mentioned?.
The differences may not be all that great.
Westerners might be slightly more complicated intellectually, but basic-ally human beings are all the same; most of the time we all want to enjoy and are preoccupied by pleasures of the senses.
It’s at the intellectual level that our characters may differ.
The differences in relation to following gurus are probably due to Asian people having had more experience in this.
I cannot say that gaining knowledge wisdom in the West is more difficult than in the East.
Actually, gaining wisdom, understanding your own nature, is an individual thing.
You can’t say it’s easier in the East than in the West.
Nor can you say that to develop knowledge-wisdom you have to renounce the Western material life.
You don’t have to give it all up.
Instead of radically abandoning everything, try to develop the outlook, I need these things, but I can’t say they’re all I need.
The problem comes when grasping and attachment dominate your mind and you put all your faith in other people and material possessions.
External objects aren’t the problem; the problem is the grasping mind that tells you, I can’t live without this.
You can lead a life of incredible luxury but at the same time be completely detached from your possessions.
The pleasure you derive from them is much greater if you enjoy them without attachment.
If you can manage that, your life will be perfect.
As Westerners you have the advantage of getting all these things without too much effort.
In the East we really have to struggle to achieve some material comfort.
As a result, there’s a tendency to cling much more strongly to our possessions, which only results in more suffering.
I hope I have answered your questions.
Thank you all so much.
I was born near Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and educated at Sera Monastic University, one of the three great monasteries in Lhasa.
There they taught us how to bring an end to human problems—not so much the problems people face in their relationship to the external environment, but the internal, mental problems we all face.
That was what I studied—Buddhist psychology; how to treat mental illness.
For the past ten years I have been working with Westerners, experimenting to see if Buddhist psychology also works for the Western mind.
In my experience, it has been extremely effective.
Recently, some of these students invited me to the West to give lectures and meditation courses, so here I am.
We lamas think that the main point is that human problems arise primarily from the mind, not from the external environment.
But rather than my talking about things that you might find irrelevant, perhaps it would be better for you to ask specific questions so that I can address directly the issues that are of most interest to you.
Dr. Stan Gold: Lama, thank you very much for coming.
Could I start by asking what you mean by “mental illness”?.
By mental illness I mean the kind of mind that does not see reality; a mind that tends to either exaggerate or underestimate the qualities of the person or object it perceives, which always causes problems to arise.
In the West, you wouldn’t consider this to be mental illness, but Western psychology’s interpretation is too narrow.
If someone is obviously emotionally disturbed, you consider that to be a problem, but if someone has a fundamental inability to see reality, to understand his or her own true nature, you don’t.
Not knowing your own basic mental attitude is a huge problem.
Human problems are more than just emotional distress or disturbed relationships.
In fact, those are tiny problems.
It’s as if there’s this huge ocean of problems below, but all we see are the small waves on the surface.
We focus on those—”Oh, yes, that’s a big problem”—while ignoring the actual cause, the dissatisfied nature of the human mind.
It’s difficult to see, but we consider people who are unaware of the nature of their dissatisfied mind to be mentally ill; their minds are not healthy.
Yes, good, wonderful.
My way of treating mental illness is to try to have the person analyze the basic nature of his own problem.
I try to show him the true nature of his mind so that with his own mind he can understand his own problems.
If he can do that, he can solve his own problems himself.
I don’t believe that I can solve his problems by simply talking to him a little.
That might make him feel a bit better, but it’s very transient relief.
The root of his problems reaches deep into his mind; as long as it’s there, changing circumstances will cause more problems to emerge.
My method is to have him check his own mind in order to gradually see its true nature.
I’ve had the experience of giving someone a little advice and having him think, “Oh, great, my problem’s gone; Lama solved it with just a few words,” but that’s a fabrication.
He’s just making it up.
There’s no way you can understand your own mental problems without your becoming your own psychologist.
It’s impossible.
I try to show them the psychological aspect of their nature, how to check their own minds.
Once they know this, they can check and solve their own problems.
I try to teach them an approach.
What, precisely, is the method that you teach for looking at our mind’s true nature?
Basically it’s a form of checking, or analytical, knowledge- wisdom.
Is it a kind of meditation?
Yes, analytical, or checking, meditation.
Let me give you an example.
Say I have a good feeling about somebody.
"I love him because he did this or that".
It’s the same thing if I feel bad about someone; I don’t like him because he did such and such.
But if you look more deeply to see if those good or bad qualities really exist within the person you may see that your discrimination of friend or enemy is based on very superficial, illogical reasoning.
You’re basing your judgment on insignificant qualities, not on the totality of the other person’s being.
You see some quality you label as good or bad, perhaps something the person said or did, and then exaggerate it out of all proportion.
Then you become agitated by what you perceive.
Through checking you can see that there’s no reason to discriminate in the way that you do; it only keeps you fettered, uptight and in suffering.
This kind of checking analyzes not the other person but your own mind, in order to see how you feel and to determine what kind of discriminating mind makes you feel that way.
So you say that the problem lies more within the person and don’t agree with the point of view that it is society that makes people sick?
For example, I have met many Western people who’ve had problems with society.
They’re angry with society, with their parents, with everything.
Then they become courteous human beings, respectful of society, their parents, their teachers and all other people.
You can’t blame society for our problems.
Why do people mix things up like that?
It’s because they don’t know their own true nature.
The environment, ideas and philosophies can be contributory causes, but primarily, problems come from one’s own mind.
Of course, the way society is organized can agitate some people, but the issues are usually small.
Unfortunately, people tend to exaggerate them and get upset.
This is how it is with society, but anyone who thinks the world can exist without it is dreaming.
Lama, what do you find in the ocean of a person’s nature?
When I use that expression I’m saying that people’s problems are like an ocean, but we see only the superficial waves.
We don’t see what lies beneath them.
It’s like looking at electrical appliances without understanding that it’s the underlying electricity that makes them function.
What kind of problems do we find below the waves?
The dissatisfied mind is the fundamental element of human nature.
We’re dissatisfied with ourselves; we’re dissatisfied with the outside world.
That dissatisfaction is like an ocean.
Do you ask the other person questions about himself or how he feels to help him understand himself?
Sometimes we do, but usually we don’t.
But it’s not usually necessary because basically, everybody’s problems are the same.
Do you do the same thing or do you do it differently?.
Our methods don’t require us to spend much time with people individually.
We explain the fundamental nature of problems and the possibility of transcending them; then we teach basic techniques of working with problems.
They practice these techniques; after a while we check to see what their experience has been.
You’re saying that basically, everybody has the same problems?
Yes, right.
East, West, it’s basically the same thing.
But in the West, people have to be clinically ill before you’ll say that they’re sick.
That’s too superficial for us.
According to Lord Buddha’s psychology and lamas’ experience, sickness runs deeper than just the overt expression of clinical symptoms.
As long as the ocean of dissatisfaction remains within you, the slightest change in the environment can be enough to bring out a problem.
As far as we’re concerned, even being susceptible to future problems means that your mind is not healthy.
All of us here are basically the same, in that our minds are dissatisfied.
As a result, a tiny change in our external circumstances can make us sick.
It’s much more important to eradicate the basic problem than to spend all our time trying to deal with superficial, emotional ones.
This approach doesn’t cease our continual experience of problems; it merely substitutes a new problem for the one we believe we’ve just solved.
Is my basic problem the same as his basic problem?
Yes, everybody’s basic problem is what we call ignorance—not understanding the nature of the dissatisfied mind.
As long you have this kind of mind, you’re in the same boat as everybody else..
This inability to see reality is not an exclusively Western problem or an exclusively Eastern problem..
It’s a human problem.
The basic problem is not knowing the nature of your mind?
Right, yes.
And everybody’s mind has the same nature?
Yes, the same nature.
Each person has the same basic problem?
Yes, but there are differences.
That’s what I’m saying.
New problems replace the old ones, but they’re still problems, because the basic problem remains.
The basic problem is like an ocean; the ones we try to solve are just the waves.
It’s the same in the East.
In India, problems people experience in the villages are different from those experienced by people who live in the capital, New Delhi, but they’re still problems.
East, West, the basic problem is the same.
Lama, as I understand it, you said that the basic problem is that individuals lose touch with their own nature
One reason is that we are preoccupied with what’s going on outside of ourselves.
We are so interested in what’s going on in the sense world that we do not take the time to examine what’s going on in our minds.
We never ask ourselves why the sense world is so interesting, why things appear as they do, why we respond to them as we do.
I’m not saying we should ignore the outside world, but we should expend at least an equal amount of energy analyzing our relationship with it.
If we can comprehend the nature of both the subject and the object, then we can really put an end to our problems.
Is the nature of each person’s satisfaction different or is it the same for people in general?
Relatively speaking, each individual has his or her own way of thinking, feeling and discriminating; therefore each person’s enjoyment is an individual thing.
Relatively.
But if you check more deeply, if you look into the profound, unchangeable, more lasting levels of feeling, happiness and joy, you will see that everybody can attain identical levels of enjoyment.
In the relative, mundane world we think, “My interests and pleasures are such and such, therefore I have to have this, this and this.
If I find myself in so and so circumstances, I’ll be miserable” .
Relatively, our experiences are individual; each of us discriminates in our own way.
But absolutely, we can experience an identical level of happiness.
People should be totally aware of both what’s going on in their own minds and how their minds are relating to the outside world, what effect the environment is having on their minds.
You can’t close your life off from the world; you have to face it; you have to be open to everything.
Is your treatment always successful?
What makes it unsuccessful in certain cases?
Sometimes there’s a problem in communication; people misunderstand what I’m saying.
Perhaps people don’t have the patience to put the methods I recommend into action.
It takes time to treat the dissatisfied mind.
Changing the mind isn’t like painting a house.
It depends on the individual and the kind of problem we’re talking about.
If you’re having a problem with your parents, maybe you can solve it in a month.
But changing and overcoming the fundamental dissatisfied mind can take many, many years.
The waves are easy; the ocean is more difficult.
Thank you, that was a very good question.
Do you have any process by which you select the people that you might try to help?
No, we have no process of selection.
People just come to you?
Irrespective of color, race, class or gender, all human beings have the same potential to solve their problems.
There’s no problem that cannot be solved by human wisdom.
If you are wise, you can solve them all.
What about people who are not so wise?
Then you have to teach people how to be wise.
Wisdom isn’t intuitive; you have to open people’s minds to it.
Can you help children to solve problems in this way?
That’s definitely possible.
But with children you can’t always intellectualize.
Sometimes you have to show them things through art or by your actions.
Sometimes it’s not so wise to tell them to do this or do that.
Lama, what sort of advice would you give parents to help their children know their inner nature?
First I’d probably say it’s better not to intellectualize verbally.
Acting correctly and creating a peaceful environment are much more likely to be effective.
If you do, children will learn automatically.
Even tiny children pick up on vibrations.
I remember that when I was a small child, when my parents argued, I felt terrible; it was painful.
You don’t need to tell children too much but rather behave properly, peacefully and gently, and create a good environment.
That’s all; especially when they’re too small to understand language.
How important is the body in human happiness?
If you want to be happy, it’s very important for your body to be healthy, because of the close link between your physical nervous system and your mind.
There’s a strong connection between the two.
Do you have any advice with respect to diet or sexual behavior in keeping the body healthy?
Both can be important.
Of course, we’re all different, so you can’t say that the same diet will suit everybody.
Also, too much sexual activity can weaken our bodies, which in turn can weaken our minds, our power of concentration or penetrative wisdom.
What is too much?
Again, that depends on the individual.
It’s not the same for everybody.
Each person’s power of body varies; check through your own experience.
As long as we’re attached to the sense world, we’re attached to our bodies, so we have to live in them.
Yes, of course, you have no choice.
You’re impermanent, therefore you have to go.
Your body is made up of the four ever-changing elements of earth, water, fire and air.
When they’re in balance, you grow properly and remain healthy.
But if one of them gets out of balance with the rest, it can cause chaos in your body and end your life.
Your mind, or consciousness, is different from your physical body, your flesh and blood.
When you die, you leave your body behind and your mind goes into a new one.
Since beginningless time we’ve been dying and being reborn into one different body after another.
That’s what we understand.
Lord Buddha’s psychology teaches that at the relative level, the characteristic nature of the mind is quite different from that of the physical body.
You can never be sure of that.
Sometimes old men are worse than children.
It depends on how much wisdom you have.
Some children are wiser than adults.
You need wisdom to make that kind of progress during your life.
If you understand yourself better in this life, do you improve in the next?
Definitely.
The better you understand the nature of your mind in this life, the better your next life will be.
Even in this life, if you understand your own nature well today, next month your experiences will be better.
Lama, what does nirvana mean?
Nirvana is a Sanskrit word that means freedom, or liberation.
Inner liberation.
It means that your heart is no longer bound by the uncontrolled, unsubdued, dissatisfied mind, not tied by attachment.
When you realize the absolute nature of your mind, you free yourself from bondage and are able to find enjoyment without dependence upon sense objects.
On the contrary, here we are taught to build our egos; if you don’t have a strong ego, you’re lost, you’re not human, you’re weak.
This seems to be society’s view.
However, from the point of view of Buddhist psychology, the conception of ego is our biggest problem, the king of problems; other emotions are like ministers, ego is king.
When you reach beyond ego, the cabinet of other delusions disappears, the agitated, bound mind vanishes, and you attain an everlasting blissful state of mind.
That’s what we call nirvana, inner freedom.
Your mind is no longer conditioned, tied to something else, like it is at the moment.
Presently, because our mind is dependent upon other phenomena, when those other phenomena move, they take our mind with them.
We have no control; our mind is led like an animal with a rope through its nose.
We are not free; we have no independence.
Of course, we think we’re free, we think we’re independent, but we’re not; we’re not free inside.
Every time the uncontrolled mind arises, we suffer.
Therefore, liberation means freedom from dependence upon other conditions and the experience of stable, everlasting bliss, instead of the up and down of our normal lives.
That’s nirvana.
Of course, this is just a brief explanation; we could talk about it for hours, but not now.
However, if you understand the nature of inner freedom, you realize that transient sense pleasures are nowhere near enough, that they’re not the most important thing.
You realize that as a human being you have the ability and the methods to reach a permanent state of everlasting, unconditional joy.
That gives you a new perspective on life.
Why do you think that the methods of Buddhist psychology offer an individual a better chance of success in achieving everlasting happiness whereas other methods may have great difficulty in doing this and sometimes never do?
I’m not saying that because Buddhist methods work we don’t need any others.
People are different; individual problems require individual solutions.
One method won’t work for everybody.
In the West, you can’t say that Christianity offers a solution to all human problems, therefore we don’t need psychology or Hinduism or any other philosophy.
That’s wrong.
We need a variety of methods because different people have different personalities and different emotional problems.
Some people think that Buddhism is a rather small subject.
In fact, Lord Buddha offered billions of solutions to the countless problems people face.
It’s almost as if a personalized solution has been given to each individual.
Buddhism never says there’s just one solution to every problem, that “This is the only way.
” Lord Buddha gave an incredible variety of solutions to cover every imaginable human problem.
Some problems have to be overcome gradually, by degrees.
Buddhist methods also take this into account.
That’s why we need many approaches.
First we try slowly, slowly to become friends in order to earn their trust.
Then, when they improve, we start to communicate.
Of course, it doesn’t always work.
The environment is also important—a quiet house in the country; a peaceful place, appropriate pictures, therapeutic colors, that kind of thing.
It’s difficult.
What is your view of anger and aggression?.
I encourage people not to express their anger, not to let it out.
Instead, I have people try to understand why they get angry, what causes it and how it arises.
When you realize these things, instead of manifesting externally, your anger digests itself.
In the West, some people believe that you get rid of anger by expressing it, that you finish it by letting it out.
Actually, in this case what happens is that you leave an imprint in your mind to get angry again.
The effect is just the opposite of what they believe.
It looks like your anger escaped but in fact you’re just collecting more anger in your mind.
The imprints that anger leaves on your consciousness simply reinforce your tendency to respond to situations with more anger.
But not allowing it to come out doesn’t mean you are suppressing it, bottling it up.
That’s also dangerous.
You have to learn to investigate the deeper nature of anger, aggression, anxiety or whatever it is that troubles you.
When you look into the deeper nature of negative energy you’ll see that it’s really quite insubstantial, that it’s only mind.
As your mental expression changes, the negative energy disappears, digested by the wisdom that understands the nature of hatred, anger, aggression and so forth.
Anger comes from attachment to sense pleasure.
This is wonderful psychology, but it can be difficult to understand.
When someone touches something to which you are very attached, you freak out.
Attachment is the source of anger.
Thank you so much, I’m very happy to have met you all.
Prince Henry’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 25 March 1975.
Buddhism can be understood on many different levels.
People who actualize the Buddhist path do so gradually.
Just as you pass slowly through school and university, graduating from one year to the next, so do Buddhist practitioners proceed step by step along the path to enlightenment.
In Buddhism, however, we’re talking about different levels of mind; here, higher and lower refer to spiritual progress.
In the West, there’s a tendency to consider Buddhism as a religion in the Western sense of the term.
This is a misconception.
Buddhism is completely open; we can talk about anything.
Buddhism has its doctrine and philosophy, but it also encourages scientific experimentation, both inner and outer.
Don’t think of Buddhism as some kind of narrow, closed-minded belief system.
Buddhist doctrine is not an historical fabrication derived through imagination and mental speculation, but an accurate psychological explanation of the actual nature of the mind.
When you look at the outside world you have a very strong impression of its substantiality.
You probably don’t realize that that strong impression is merely your own mind’s interpretation of what it sees.
You think that the strong, solid reality really exists outside, and perhaps, when you look within, you feel empty.
This is also a misconception: the strong impression that the world appears to truly exist outside of you is actually projected by your own mind.
Everything you experience—feelings, sensations, shapes and colors—comes from your mind.
Whether you get up one morning with a foggy mind and the world around you appears to be dark and foggy, or you awaken with a clear mind and your world seems beautiful and light, understand that these different impressions are coming from your own mind rather than from changes in the external environment.
Instead of misinterpreting whatever you experience in life through wrong conceptions, realize that it’s not outer reality, but only mind.
For example, when everybody in this auditorium looks at a single object—me, Lama Yeshe—each of you has a distinctly different experience, even though simultaneously you are all looking at the one thing.
These different experiences don’t come from me; they come from your own minds.
Check deeper.
You’ll see that the way you perceive me, the way you feel, is individual, and that at that level, you’re all different.
These various perceptions do not come from me but from your own minds.
That’s the point I’m making.
Then the thought might arise, “Oh, he’s just a lama; all he knows about is mind.
He doesn’t know about powerful scientific advances like satellites and other sophisticated technology.
There’s no way you can say that those things come from mind”.
When the first satellite was made, its inventor said, “I’ve made this thing that orbits the earth; it’s called a ‘satellite’” .
Then when everybody else saw it, they thought, “Ah, that’s a satellite” .
But “satellite” is just a name, isn’t it?.
Before the inventor of the satellite actually made it, he speculated and visualized it in his mind.
On the basis of this image, he acted to materialize his creation.
That shows how ridiculous we are.
People give things names and we grasp at the name, believing it to be the real thing.
It’s the same thing no matter what colors and forms we grasp at.
You check up.
If you can understand what I’m explaining here, you’ll see that indeed, satellites and so forth do come from the mind, and that without mind, there is not a single manifest material existence in the entire sense world.
First people made it all up—this name, that name, this, this, this—so then, this, that, this, this and this all appear to you.
If you check into how your mind expresses itself, your various views and feelings, your imagination, you will realize that all your emotions, the way you live your life, the way you relate to others, all come from your own mind.
If you don’t understand how your mind works, you’re going to continue having negative experiences like anger and depression.
A mind with understanding functions clearly.
A clear mind is a positive mind.
Any emotional problem you experience arises because of the way your mind functions; your basic problem lies in the way you misidentify yourself.
Do you normally hold yourself in low esteem, see yourself as a poor quality human being, while what you really want is for your life to be of the highest quality, to be perfect?.
All you need to do is to understand your true nature, the way you already are.
What I’m talking about here is not Tibetan culture, some Eastern trip.
I’m talking about your trip.
Actually, it doesn’t matter whose trip I’m talking about; we’re all basically the same.
There’s no difference, whether you have long hair or short, whether you’re black, white or red, no matter what clothes you wear.
We’re all the same.
Superficial observation of the sense world might lead you to believe that people’s problems are different, but if you check more deeply, you will see that fundamentally, they are the same.
What makes people’s problems appear unique is their different interpretation of their experiences.
This way of checking reality is not necessarily a spiritual exercise.
You neither have to believe nor deny that you have a mind—all you have to do is observe how it functions and how you act, and not obsess too much about the world around you.
Lord Buddha never put much emphasis on belief.
Instead, he exhorted us to investigate and try to understand the reality of our own being.
He never stressed that we had to know what he was, what a buddha is.
All he wanted was for us to understand our own nature.
Simply by making the right effort, you understand things through your own experience, and gradually develop all realizations.
But their nature is actually something else.
If a hundred people look at a mountain at the same time, they all see different aspects, different colors, different features.
In conclusion, I’m saying that your everyday, superficial view of the sense world does not reflect its true reality.
The way you interpret Melbourne, your imagination of how Melbourne exists, has nothing whatsoever to do with the reality of Melbourne—even though you might have been born in Melbourne and have spent your entire up and down life in Melbourne.
In saying all this, I’m not making a definitive statement but rather offering you a suggestion of how to look at things afresh.
I’m not trying to push my own ideas onto you.
All I’m doing is recommending that you set aside your usual sluggish mind, which simply takes what it sees at face value, and check with a different mind, a fresh mind.
Most of the decisions that your mind has been making from the time you were born—”This is right; this is wrong; this is not reality”—have been misconceptions.
A mind possessed by misconceptions is an uncertain mind, never sure of anything.
A small change in the external conditions and it freaks out; even small things make it crazy.
If you could only see the whole picture, you’d see how silly this was.
But we don’t see totality; totality is too big for us.
Seeing totality, it never pays attention to minutiae.
Some energy coming from here clashing with some other energy from there never upsets the wise because they expect things like that to happen; it’s in their nature.
If you have the misconception that your life will be perfect, you will always be shocked by its up and down nature.
If you expect your life to be up and down, your mind will be much more peaceful.
Thank you so much.
I hope you’ve understood what I’ve been saying and that I have not created more wrong conceptions.
We have to finish now.
Thank you.
Look into your mind.
If you fervently believe that all your enjoyment comes from the material objects and dedicate your entire life to their pursuit, you’re under the control of a serious misconception.
This attitude is not simply an intellectual thing.
When you first hear this, you might think, “Oh, I don’t have that kind of mind; I don’t have complete faith that external objects will bring me happiness”.
But check more deeply in the mirror of your mind.
You will find that beyond the intellect, such an attitude is indeed there and that your everyday actions show that deep within, you really do believe this misconception.
Take a moment now to check within yourself to see whether or not you really are under the influence of such an inferior mind.
A mind that has such strong faith in the material world is narrow, limited; it has no space.
Its nature is sick, unhealthy, or, in Buddhist terminology, dualistic.
In many countries people are afraid of those who act out of the ordinary, such as those who use drugs.
They make laws against the use of drugs and set up elaborate customs controls to catch people smuggling them into the country.
Examine this more closely.
Drug taking doesn’t come from the drug itself but from the person’s mind.
It would be more sensible to be afraid of the psychological attitude—the polluted mind—that makes people take drugs or engage in other self-destructive behavior, but instead, we make a lot of fuss about the drugs themselves, completely ignoring the role of the mind.
This, too, is a serious misconception, much worse than the drugs a few people take.
Misconceptions are much more dangerous than just a few drugs.
Drugs themselves don’t spread too far, but misconceptions can spread everywhere and cause difficulty and unrest throughout an entire country.
All this comes from the mind.
The problem is that we don’t understand the psychological nature of the mind.
We pay attention to only the physical substances that people take; we’re totally unaware of the stupid ideas and polluted misconceptions that are crossing borders all the time.
All mental problems come from the mind.
We have to treat the mind rather than tell people, “Oh, you’re unhappy because you’re feeling weak.
What you need is a powerful new car”.
or some other kind of material possessions.
Telling people to go buy something to be happy is not wise advice.
The person’s basic problem is mental dissatisfaction, not a lack of material possessions.
When it comes to the approach to mental problems and how to treat patients, there’s a big difference between Lord Buddha’s psychology and that which is practiced in the West.
When the patient returns and says, “Well, I bought the car you recommended but I’m still unhappy,” perhaps the doctor will say, “You should have bought a more expensive one” or “You should have chosen a better color” .
Even if he goes away and does that, he’s still going to come back unhappy.
No matter how many superficial changes are made to a person’s environment, his problems won’t stop.
Buddhist psychology recommends that, instead of constantly substituting one agitated condition for another—thereby simply changing one problem into another and then another and then another without end—give up cars completely for a while and see what happens.
Sublimating one problem into another solves nothing; it’s merely change.
Though change may often be enough to fool people into thinking they’re getting better, they’re not.
Basically they’re still experiencing the same thing.
Of course, I don’t mean all this literally.
I’m simply trying to illustrate how people try to solve mental problems through physical means.
Recognize the nature of your mind.
As human beings, we always seek satisfaction.
By knowing the nature of the mind, we can satisfy ourselves internally; perhaps even eternally.
But you must realize the nature of your own mind.
We see the sense world so clearly, but we’re completely blind to our internal world, where the constant functioning of misconceptions keep us under the control of unhappiness and dissatisfaction.
This is what we must discover.
It is crucial, therefore, to make sure that you are not laboring under the misconception that only external objects can give you satisfaction or make your life worthwhile.
As I said before, this belief is not simply intellectual—the long root of this delusion reaches deep into your mind.
Many of your strongest desires are buried far below your intellect; that which lies beneath the intellect is usually much stronger than the intellect itself.
Some people might think, “My basic psychology is sound.
I don’t have faith in materials; I’m a student of religion” .
Simply having learned some religious philosophy or doctrine doesn’t make you a spiritual person.
Many university professors can give clear intellectual explanations of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, but that alone doesn’t make them spiritual people.
They’re more like tourist guides for the spiritually curious.
If you can’t put your words into experience, your learning helps neither yourselves nor others.
There’s a big difference between being able to explain religion intellectually and transforming that knowledge into spiritual experience.
You have to put what you’ve learned into your own experience and understand the results that various actions bring.
A cup of tea is probably of more use than learned scholarship of a philosophy that cannot support your mind because you don’t have the key—at least it quenches your thirst.
Studying a philosophy that doesn’t function is a waste of time and energy.
I hope that you understand what the word “spiritual” really means.
It means to search for, to investigate, the true nature of the mind.
There’s nothing spiritual outside.
My rosary isn’t spiritual; my robes aren’t spiritual.
Spiritual means the mind, and spiritual people are those who seek its nature.
Through this, they come to understand the effects of their behavior, the actions of their body, speech and mind.
If you don’t understand the karmic results of what you think and do, there’s no way for you to become a spiritual person.
Just knowing some religious philosophy isn’t enough to make you spiritual.
To enter the spiritual path, you must begin to understand your own mental attitude and how your mind perceives things.
If you’re all caught up in attachment to tiny atoms, your limited, craving mind will make it impossible for you to enjoy life’s pleasures.
External energy is so incredibly limited that if you allow yourself to be bound by it, your mind itself will become just as limited.
When your mind is narrow, small things agitate you very easily.
Make your mind an ocean.
We hear religious people talk a lot about morality.
The mind that understands its own nature automatically becomes moral, or positive; and the actions motivated by such a mind also become positive.
That’s what we call morality.
The basic nature of the narrow mind is ignorance; therefore the narrow mind is negative.
If you know the psychological nature of your own mind, depression is spontaneously dispelled; instead of being enemies and strangers, all living beings become your friends.
The narrow mind rejects; wisdom accepts.
Check your own mind to see whether or not this is true.
Even if you were to get every possible sense pleasure that the universe could offer, you would still not be satisfied.
That shows that satisfaction comes from within, not from anything external.
But step back and take another look.
Many of the things we thought fantastic not so long ago are now rising up against us.
Things we developed to help our lives are now hurting us.
Don’t just look at your immediate surroundings, but check as widely as possible; you’ll see the truth of what I’m saying.
When we first create material things we think, “Oh, this is useful” .
But gradually this external energy turns inward and destroys itself.
Such is the nature of the four elements: earth, water, fire and air.
This is what Buddhist science teaches us.
Your body is no exception to this rule.
As long as your elements are cooperating with each other, your body grows beautifully.
But after a while the elements turn against themselves and finish up destroying your life.
When our bodies become sick and decrepit it’s a sign that our internal energies are in conflict, out of balance.
This is the nature of the material world; it has nothing to do with faith.
As long as we keep being born into the meat, blood and bone of the human body, we’re going to experience bad conditions, whether we believe it or not.
This is the natural evolution of the worldly body.
The human mind, however, is completely different.
The human mind has the potential for infinite development.
If you can discover, even in a small way, that true satisfaction comes from your mind, you will realize that you can extend this experience without limit and that it is possible to discover everlasting satisfaction.
It’s actually very simple.
You can check for yourself right now.
Anyway, whatever pain, pleasure or other feeling you experience, it’s all an expression of mind.
When you say, “I had a good day today,” it shows that you’re holding in your mind the memory of a bad day.
Without the mind creating labels, there’s neither good experience nor bad.
When you say that tonight’s dinner was good, it means that you’re holding the experience of a bad dinner in mind.
Without the experience of a bad dinner it’s impossible for you to call tonight’s good.
Similarly, “I’m a good husband,” “I’m a bad wife,” are also merely expressions of mind.
Someone who says, “I am bad” is not necessarily bad; someone who says, “I am good” is not necessarily good.
Perhaps the man who says, “I’m such a good husband” does so because his mind is full of the disturbing negative mind of pride.
His narrow mind, stuck in the deluded, concrete belief that he’s good, actually causes much difficulty for his wife.
If you can understand the psychological aspects of human problems, you can really generate true loving kindness towards others.
Just talking about loving kindness doesn’t help you develop it.
Some people may have read about loving kindness hundreds of times but their minds are the very opposite.
It’s not just philosophy, not just words; it’s knowing how the mind functions.
Only then can you develop loving kindness; only then can you become a spiritual person.
Otherwise, though you might be convinced you’re a spiritual person, it’s just intellectual, like the arrogant man who believes he’s a good husband.
It’s a fiction; your mind just makes it up.
It is so worthwhile that you devote your precious human life to controlling your mad elephant mind and giving direction to your powerful mental energy.
If you don’t harness your mental energy, confusion will continue to rage through your mind and your life will be completely wasted.
Be as wise with your own mind as you possibly can.
That makes your life worthwhile.
I don’t have much else to tell you, but if you have any questions, please ask.
I understand what you said about knowing the nature of your own mind bringing you happiness, but you used the term “everlasting,” which implies that if you understand your mind completely, you can transcend death of the physical body
Is this correct?
Yes, that’s right
But that’s not all
If you know how, when negative physical energy arises, you can convert it into wisdom
Is the mind body, or is the body mind?
Because I perceive the body
That’s what I’m asking you
Well, that’s a good question
Your body and mind are very strongly connected; when something affects your body it also affects your mind
But that doesn’t mean that the relative nature of your physical body, its meat and bone, is mind
You can’t say that
What are the aims of Buddhism: enlightenment, brotherhood, universal love, super consciousness, realization of the truth, the attainment of nirvana?
At the moment, our dualistic, wrong-conception minds discriminate: “This is my close friend, I want to keep her for myself and not share her with others”
One of Buddhism’s aims is to attain the opposite of this, universal love
Of course, the ultimate goal is enlightenment
In short, the aim of Lord Buddha’s teachings on the nature of the mind is for us to gain all those realizations you mentioned
But which is considered to be the highest or most important aim?
The highest aims are enlightenment and the development of universal love
The narrow mind finds it difficult to experience such realizations
In Tibetan paintings, how do colors correspond with states of meditation or different psychological states?
Different kinds of mind perceive different colors
Other states of mind visualize their own respective colors
In some cases, where people are emotionally disturbed and unable to function in their daily lives, surrounding them with certain colors can help settle them down
If you think about this you will discover that color really comes from the mind
What are the practical, daily life implications of your saying that in order to have the idea that something is good you must also have in your mind the idea of bad?
I was saying that when you interpret things as good or bad it’s your own mind’s interpretation
What’s bad for you is not necessarily bad for me
But my bad is still my bad
Your bad is bad for you because your mind calls it bad
Can I go beyond that?
You have to ask and answer the question, “Why do I call this bad?” You have to question both the object and the subject, both the external and the internal situations
In that way you can realize that the reality is somewhere in between, that in the space between the two there’s a unified mind
That’s wisdom
How old were you when you entered the monastery?
What is nirvana?
When you transcend the wrong-conception, agitated mind and attain fully integrated, everlastingly satisfied wisdom, you have reached nirvana
Every religion says that it is the one way to enlightenment
Does Buddhism recognize all religions as coming from the same source?
There are two ways of answering that question, the absolute and the relative
Religions that emphasize the attainment of enlightenment are probably talking about the same thing, but where they differ is in their approach, in their methods
I think this is helpful
But it’s also true that some religions may be based on misconceptions
Nevertheless, I don’t repudiate them
For example, a couple of thousand years ago there were some ancient Hindu traditions that believed the sun and moon to be gods; some of them still exist
From my point of view, those conceptions are wrong, but I still say that they’re good
That gives their followers the possibility of reaching the point where they discover for themselves, “Oh, I used to believe that the sun was a god but now I see I was wrong”
Therefore, there’s good in every religion and we should not judge, “This is totally right; that is totally wrong
They are not free and are completely prohibited from any religious practice
The Chinese authorities are totally against anything to do with religion
Monasteries have been destroyed and sacred scriptures burned
But even though their books have been burned, do the older people still keep the Dharma in their hearts and minds, or have they forgotten everything?
It’s impossible to forget, to separate their minds from such powerful wisdom
So the Dharma remains in their hearts
All religions, for example, Hinduism, teach their adherents to avoid evil actions and to practice good ones and that good karmic results will ensue
How, according to Buddhism, does this accumulation of positive karma help one attain enlightenment?
Mental development does not happen through radical change
Defilements are eliminated, or purified, slowly, slowly
There’s a gradual evolution
It takes time
Some people, for instance, cannot accept what Buddhism teaches about universal love, that you should want others to have the happiness that you want for yourself
They feel, “It’s impossible for me to love all others as I love myself
” It takes time for them to realize universal love or enlightenment because their minds are preoccupied by misconceptions and there’s no space for wisdom
But slowly, slowly, through practicing their religion, people can be lead to perfect wisdom
That’s why I say that a variety of religions is necessary for the human race
Physical change is easy, but mental development takes time
For example, a doctor might tell a sick person, “Your temperature is very high, so please avoid meat and eat only dry biscuits for a few days”
Then, as the person starts to recover, the doctor slowly reintroduces heavy food into his diet
When Tibetan monks and nuns die, do their bodies disappear, do they take their bodies with them?
Yes, they carry them to their next lives in their jola [monk’s shoulder bag]
Still, there are certain practitioners whose bodies are digested into wisdom and actually disappear
That’s possible
But they don’t take their bodies with them physically
Yes, monasteries are something like that, and it’s also true that I learn as I teach
We need a key to put it into experience, to unify that knowledge with our minds
Then know-ledge becomes wisdom and the perfect solution to problems
For example, the Bible is an excellent book that contains all kinds of great methods, but if you don’t have the key, the knowledge that’s in the Bible doesn’t enter your heart
Just because a book is excellent doesn’t necessarily mean that by reading it you’ll gain the knowledge it contains
The only way that can happen is for your mind to first develop wisdom
You said that getting enlightened is a gradual process, but surely you can’t be both enlightened and unenlightened at the same time
Wouldn’t that mean, therefore, that enlightenment is sudden?
Of course, you’re right
You can’t be enlightened and ignorant together
Approaching enlightenment is a gradual process, but once you attain it, there’s no going back; when you reach the fully awakened state of mind, the moment you experience that, you remain enlightened forever
It’s not like some hallucinatory drug experience—when you’re high you’re having a good time, and when the effect of the drug wears off you’re back down to your usual depressed self
And we can experience that in this life, permanent enlightenment, while we’re still alive, before we die?
In this life, if you have enough wisdom
Why do we need a teacher?
It’s the same thing with enlightenment
Enlightenment is also communication
Even for mundane activities like shopping we need to learn the language so that we can communicate with the shopkeepers
If we need teachers for that, of course we need someone to guide us along a path that deals with so many unknowns like past and future lives and deep levels of consciousness
These are entirely new experiences; you don’t know where you’re going or what’s happening
You need someone to make sure you’re on the right track and not hallucinating
Who taught the first teacher?
Well, if the first teacher didn’t have a human teacher, why do any of us need one?
Because there’s no beginning, and there’s no end
Wisdom is universal wisdom, wisdom is universal consciousness
Does generating universal love bring you to enlightenment or do you first have to reach enlightenment and then generate universal love?
First you generate universal love
Then your mind attains the realization of equilibrium, where you emphasize neither this nor that
Your mind attains a state of balance
In Buddhist terminology, you reach beyond the dualistic mind
No, it’s impossible for you to abandon your mind
While you’re a human, living what we call an ordinary life, you have mind; when you reach enlightenment, you still have mind
Your mind is always with you
You can’t get rid of it simply by saying, “I don’t want to have a mind”
Karmically, your mind and body are stuck together
It’s impossible to relinquish your mind intellectually
If your mind were a material phenomenon, perhaps you could, but it’s not
Yes, sometimes we use healing power; sometimes we use the power of mantra; sometimes we meditate
At certain other times we do puja
Puja is a Sanskrit word whose literal meaning is “offering”; but its interpretive meaning is wisdom, an awakened state of mind
So, if your wisdom is ringing, “ting, ting, ting,” that’s good, but if your wisdom isn’t ringing and the only ting, ting, ting you hear is the external one, then that’s no puja
What you’re saying is not that far removed from Western materialist philosophy
Our problems are not so much with objects as with our attitude towards them
When you say attitude, are you referring to the mental tendency to grasp or not to grasp at material objects?
Well, external objects do exist, but they exist outside of ourselves, and our consciousness perceives them on the same plane
I believe that when we die, the objects remain, but not for us, not for the individual
I agree with you
When we die, the external objects are still there, but our interpretation of them, our projection, disappears
So how is that so radically opposed to materialistic philosophy?
I say that the material world is illusory because the objects you perceive exist only in the view of your own mind
Look at this table: the problem is that you think that when you disappear, your view of this table still exists, that this table continues to exist just the way you saw it
That’s not true
Your view of the table disappears, but another view of the table continues to exist
How can we recognize the right teacher?
You can recognize your teacher through using your own wisdom and not just following someone blindly
Investigate potential teachers as much as you possibly can
“Is this the right teacher for me or not?” Check deeply before you follow any teacher’s advice
In Tibetan we have an admonition not to take a teacher like a dog seizes a piece of meat
If you give a hungry dog a piece of meat he’ll just gobble it up without hesitation
It is crucial that you examine possible spiritual leaders, teachers, gurus or whatever you call them very, very carefully before accepting their guidance
Remember what I said before about misconceptions and polluted doctrines being more dangerous than drugs?
If you follow the misconceptions of a false spiritual guide it can have a disastrous effect on you and cause you to waste not only this life but many others as well
Instead of helping you, it can bring you great harm
Please, be very wise in choosing your spiritual teacher
Is that possible, and if not, how could he have written those books?
I don’t think that this kind of possession is possible
Also, you should check what he wrote more carefully; there are many mistakes in his books
For example, when he talks about lamas opening the wisdom eye he says it’s done surgically
The wisdom eye is a metaphor for spiritual insight and it’s opened by lamas who have the key of wisdom
Also, those who have realizations don’t talk about them, and those who talk about their realizations don’t have them
From the time you were born up to the present, two things have always complicated your mind; there are always two things, never just one
That’s what we mean by the dualistic mind
Whenever you see one thing, your mind automatically, instinctively, compares it to something else: “What about that?” Those two things upset your equilibrium
That’s the dualistic mind at work
Now, your other question
When I say check up, I mean that you should investigate your own mind to see if it’s healthy or not
Every morning, check your mental state to make sure that during the day you don’t freak out
That’s all I mean by “check up”
If everything is karmically determined, how do we know if our motivation is correct, or do we have a chance of unconditioned choice?
Pure motivation is not determined by karma
Pure motivation comes from understanding-knowledge-wisdom
If there’s no understanding in your mind it’s difficult for your motivation to be pure
For example, if I don’t understand my own selfish nature, I can’t help others
As long as I don’t recognize my selfish behavior, I always blame others for my problems
When I know my own mind, my motivation becomes pure and I can sincerely dedicate the actions of my body, speech and mind to the welfare of others
Thank you, that was a wonderful question, and I think that pure motivation is a good place to stop
Thank you so much
If we have pure motivation, we sleep well, dream well and enjoy well, so thank you very much
Assembly Hall, Melbourne, Australia, 27 March 1975
Man is an amphibian who lives simultaneously in two worlds—the given and the home-made, the world of matter, life and consciousness and the world of symbols.
In our thinking we make use of a great variety of symbol-systems—linguistic, mathematical, pictorial, musical, ritualistic.
Without such symbol-systems we should have no art, no science, no law, no philosophy, not so much as the rudiments of civilization: in other words, we should be animals.
Symbols, then, are indispensable.
But symbols—as the history of our own and every other age makes so abundantly clear—can also be fatal.
Consider, for example, the domain of science on the one hand, the domain of politics and religion on the other.
Thinking in terms of, and acting in response to, one set of symbols, we have come, in some small measure, to understand and control the elementary forces of nature.
Thinking in terms of, and acting in response to, another set of symbols, we use these forces as instruments of mass murder and collective suicide.
In the first case the explanatory symbols were well chosen, carefully analysed and progressively adapted to the emergent facts of physical existence.
In the second case symbols originally ill-chosen were never subjected to thorough-going analysis and never re-formulated so as to harmonize with the emergent facts of human existence.
Worse still, these misleading symbols were everywhere treated with a wholly unwarranted respect, as though, in some mysterious way, they were more real than the realities to which they referred.
Up to the present symbols have been used realistically only in those fields which we do not feel to be supremely important.
In every situation involving our deeper impulses we have insisted on using symbols, not merely unrealistically, but idolatrously, even insanely.
The result is that we have been able to commit, in cold blood and over long periods of time, acts of which the brutes are capable only for brief moments and at the frantic height of rage, desire or fear.
Because they use and worship symbols, men can become idealists; and, being idealists, they can transform the animal’s intermittent greed into the grandiose imperialisms of a Rhodes or a J. P. Morgan;
the animal’s intermittent love of bullying into Stalinism or the Spanish Inquisition; the animal’s intermittent attachment to its territory into the calculated frenzies of nationalism.
Happily, they can also transform the animal’s intermittent kindliness into the lifelong charity of an Elizabeth Fry or a Vincent de Paul; the animal’s intermittent devotion to its mate and its young into that reasoned and persistent co-operation which, up to the present, has proved strong enough to save the world from the consequences of the other, the disastrous kind of idealism.
All we can say is that, with the idealists of nationalism holding the A-bomb, the odds in favour of the idealists of co-operation and charity have sharply declined.
Even the best cookery book is no substitute for even the worst dinner.
The fact seems sufficiently obvious.
And yet, throughout the ages, the most profound philosophers, the most learned and acute theologians have constantly fallen into the error of identifying their purely verbal constructions with facts, or into the yet more enormous error of imagining that symbols are somehow more real than what they stand for.
Their word-worship did not go without protest.
“Only the spirit,” said St. Paul, “gives life; the letter kills.”
At the other end of the world the author of one of the Mahayana sutras affirmed that “the truth was never preached by the Buddha, seeing that you have to realize it within yourself”.
Such utterances were felt to be profoundly subversive, and respectable people ignored them.
The strange idolatrous over-estimation of words and emblems continued unchecked.
Religions declined; but the old habit of formulating creeds and imposing belief in dogmas persisted even among the atheists.
In recent years logicians and semanticists have carried out a very thorough analysis of the symbols, in terms of which men do their thinking.
Linguistics has become a science, and one may even study a subject to which the late Benjamin Whorf gave the name of meta-linguistics.
All this is greatly to the good; but it is not enough.
Logic and semantics, linguistics and meta-linguistics—these are purely intellectual disciplines.
They analyse the various ways, correct and incorrect, meaningful and meaningless, in which words can be related to things, processes and events.
But they offer no guidance, in regard to the much more fundamental problem of the relationship of man in his psychophysical totality, on the one hand, and his two worlds, of data and of symbols, on the other.
In every region and at every period of history, the problem has been repeatedly solved by individual men and women.
Even when they spoke or wrote, these individuals created no systems—for they knew that every system is a standing temptation to take symbols too seriously, to pay more attention to words than to the realities for which the words are supposed to stand.
Their aim was never to offer ready-made explanations and panaceas; it was to induce people to diagnose and cure their own ills, to get them to go to the place where man’s problem and its solution present themselves directly to experience.
In this volume of selections from the writings and recorded talks of Krishnamurti, the reader will find a clear contemporary statement of the fundamental human problem,together with an invitation to solve it in the only way in which it can be solved—for and by himself.
The collective solutions, to which so many so desperately pin their faith, are never adequate.
“To understand the misery and confusion that exist within ourselves, and so in the world, we must first find clarity within ourselves, and that clarity comes about through right thinking.
This clarity is not to be organized, for it cannot be exchanged with another.
Organized group thought is merely repetitive.
Clarity is not the result of verbal assertion, but of intense self-awareness and right thinking.
Right thinking is not the outcome of or mere cultivation of the intellect, nor is it conformity to pattern, however worthy and noble.
Right thinking comes with self-knowledge.
Without understanding yourself, you have no basis for thought; without self-knowledge, what you think is not true.”
This fundamental theme is developed by Krishnamurti in passage after passage.
“There is hope in men, not in society, not in systems, organized religious systems, but in you and in me.”
Organized religions, with their mediators, their sacred books, their dogmas, their hierarchies and rituals, offer only a false solution to the basic problem.
It is a lie; for truth cannot be repeated.”
A lie can be extended, propounded and repeated, but not truth; and when you repeat truth, it ceases to be truth, and therefore sacred books are unimportant.
It is through self-knowledge, not through belief in somebody else’s symbols, that a man comes to the eternal reality, in which his being is grounded.
Belief in the complete adequacy and superlative value of any given symbol-system leads not to liberation, but to history, to more of the same old disasters.
“Belief inevitably separates.
All organized beliefs are based on separation, though they may preach brotherhood.
” The man who has successfully solved the problem of his relations with the two worlds of data and symbols, is a man who has no beliefs.
With regard to the problems of practical life he entertains a series of working hypotheses, which serve his purposes, but are taken no more seriously than any other kind of tool or instrument.
With regard to his fellow beings and to the reality in which they are grounded, he has the direct experiences of love and insight.
It is to protect himself from beliefs that Krishnamurti has “not read any sacred literature, neither the Bhagavad Gita nor the Upanishads”.
The rest of us do not even read sacred literature; we read our favourite newspapers, magazines and detective stories.
This means that we approach the crisis of our times, not with love and insight, but “with formulas, with systems”—and pretty poor formulas and systems at that.
But “men of good will should not have formulas”; for formulas lead, inevitably, only to “blind thinking”.
Addiction to formulas is almost universal.
Inevitably so; for “our system of upbringing is based upon what to think, not on how to think”.
We are brought up as believing and practising members of some organization—the Communist or the Christian, the Moslem, the Hindu, the Buddhist, the Freudian.
Conseqently “you respond to the challenge, which is always new, according to an old pattern; and therefore your response has no corresponding validity, newness, freshness.
If you respond to a challenge according to the old conditioning, your response will not enable you to understand the new challenge.
Therefore what “one has to do, in order to meet the new challenge, is to strip oneself completely, denude oneself entirely of the background and meet the challenge anew”.
In other words symbols should never be raised to the rank of dogmas, nor should any system be regarded as more than a provisional convenience.
Belief in formulas and action in accordance with these beliefs cannot bring us to a solution of our problem.
“It is only through creative understanding of ourselves that there can be a creative world, a happy world, a world in which ideas do not exist.”
A world in which ideas do not exist would be a happy world, because it would be a world without the powerful conditioning forces which compel men to undertake inappropriate action, a world without the hallowed dogmas in terms of which the worst crimes are justified, the greatest follies elaborately rationalized.
An education that teaches us not how but what to think is an education that calls for a governing class of pastors and masters.
But “the very idea of leading somebody is antisocial and anti-spiritual”.
To the man who exercises it, leadership brings gratification of the craving for power; to those who are led, it brings the gratification of the desire for certainty and security.
The guru provides a kind of dope.
I am not telling you what you should do from moment to moment, or from day to day, but I am just pointing out something to you; you can take it or leave it, depending on you, not on me.
I do not demand a thing from you, neither your worship, nor your flattery, nor your insults, nor your gods.
I say, This is a fact; take it or leave it.
And most of you will leave it, for the obvious reason that you do not find gratification in it.
It is not leadership, not mediation, not spiritual direction, not even example.
It is not ritual, not a church, not a code, not uplift or any form of inspirational twaddle.
In order to find the solution, the mind must open itself to reality, must confront the givenness of the outer and inner worlds without preconceptions or restrictions.
God’s service is perfect freedom.
Conversely, perfect freedom is the service of God.
In becoming disciplined, the mind undergoes no radical change; it is the old self, but “tethered, held in control”.
Self-discipline joins the list of things which Krishnamurti does not offer.
“Prayer may bring you the answer you seek; but that answer may come from your unconscious, or from the general reservoir, the store-house of all your demands.
The answer is not the still voice of God.”
Consider, Krishnamurti goes on, “what happens when you pray.
You kneel as the Christians do, or you sit as the Hindus do, and you repeat and repeat, and through that repetition the mind becomes quiet.
In that quietness there is the intimation of something.
That intimation of something, for which you have prayed, may be from the unconscious, or it may be the response of your memories.
But, surely, it is not the voice of reality; for the voice of reality must come to you; it cannot be appealed to, you cannot pray to it.
You cannot entice it into your little cage by doing puja, bhajan and all the rest of it, by offering it flowers, by placating it, by suppressing yourself or emulating others.
Once you have learned the trick of quietening the mind, through the repetition of words, and of receiving hints in that quietness, the danger is—unless you are fully alert as to whence those hints come—that you will be caught, and then prayer becomes a substitute for the search for Truth.
That which you ask for you get; but it is not the truth.
If you want, and if you petition, you will receive, but you will pay for it in the end.
From prayer we pass to yoga, and yoga, we find, is another of the things which Krishnamurti does not offer.
For yoga is concentration, and concentration is exclusion.
“You build a wall of resistance by concentration on a thought which you have chosen, and you try to ward off all the others.”
What is commonly called meditation is merely “the cultivation of resistance, of exclusive concentration on an idea of our choice”.
Why choose one and discard all the others, in combating which you spend all your energies, thereby creating resistance, conflict and friction.
Whereas if you consider every thought as it arises—every thought, not just a few thoughts—then there is no exclusion.
But it is an arduous thing to examine every thought.
Because, as you are looking at one thought, another slips in.
But if you are aware without domination or justification, you will see that, by merely looking at that thought, no other thought intrudes.
It is only when you condemn, compare, approximate, that other thoughts enter in.
“Judge not that ye be not judged.”
The gospel precept applies to our dealings with ourselves no less than to our dealings with others.
Where there is judgement, where there is comparison and condemnation, openness of mind is absent; there can be no freedom from the tyranny of symbols and systems, no escape from the past and the environment.
Introspection with a predetermined purpose, self-examination within the framework of some traditional code, some set of hallowed postulates—these do not, these cannot help us.
There is a transcendent spontaneity of life, a ‘creative Reality’, as Krishnamurti calls it, which reveals itself as immanent only when the perceiver’s mind is in a state of ‘alert passivity’, of ‘choiceless awareness’.
Judgement and comparison commit us irrevocably to duality.
Only choice-less awareness can lead to non-duality, to the reconciliation of opposites in a total understanding and a total love.
Ama et fac quod vis.
If you love, you may do what you will.
But if you start by doing what you will, or by doing what you don’t will in obedience to some traditional system or notions, ideals and prohibitions, you will never love.
The liberating process must begin with the choiceless awareness of what you will and of your reactions to the symbol-system which tells you that you ought, or ought not, to will it.
Through this choiceless awareness, as it penetrates the successive layers of the ego and its associated sub-conscious, will come love and understanding, but of another order than that with which we are ordinarily familiar.
This choiceless awareness—at every moment and in all the circumstances of life—is the only effective meditation.
All other forms of yoga lead either to the blind thinking which results from self-discipline, or to some kind of self-induced rapture, some form of false samadhi.
The true liberation is “an inner freedom of creative Reality”.
This “is not a gift; it is to be discovered and experienced.
It is not an acquisition to be gathered to yourself to glorify yourself.
It is a state of being, as silence, in which there is no becoming, in which there is completeness.
This creativeness may not necessarily seek expression; it is not a talent that demands outward manifestation.
You need not be a great artist or have an audience; if you seek these, you will miss the inward Reality.
It is neither a gift, nor is it the outcome of talent; it is to be found, this imperishable treasure, where thought frees itself from lust, ill-will and ignorance, where thought frees itself from worldliness and personal craving to be.
It is to be experienced through right thinking and meditation.”
Choiceless self-awareness will bring us to the creative Reality which underlies all our destructive make-believes, to the tranquil wisdom which is always there, in spite of ignorance, in spite of the knowledge which is merely ignorance in another form.
Knowledge is an affair of symbols and is, all too often, a hindrance to wisdom, to the uncovering of the self from moment to moment.
A mind that has come to the stillness of wisdom “shall know being, shall know what it is to love.
Love is neither personal nor impersonal.
Love is love, not to be defined or described by the mind as exclusive or inclusive.
Love is its own eternity; it is the real, the supreme, the immeasurable.
TO COMMUNICATE with one another, even if we know each other very well, is extremely difficult.
I may use words that may have to you a significance different from mine.
Understanding comes when we, you and I, meet on the same level at the same time.
That happens only when there is real affection between people, between husband and wife, between intimate friends.
That is real communion.
Instantaneous understanding comes when we meet on the same level at the same time.
It is very difficult to commune with one another easily, effectively and with definitive action.
I am using words which are simple, which are not technical, because I do not think that any technical type of expression is going to help us solve our difficult problems; so I am not going to use any technical terms, either of psychology or of science.
I have not read any books on psychology or any religious books, fortunately.
I would like to convey, by the very simple words which we use in our daily fife, a deeper significance; but that is very difficult if you do not know how to listen.
There is an art of listening.
To be able really to listen, one should abandon or put aside all prejudices, pre-formulations and daily activities.
When you are in a receptive state of mind, things can be easily understood; you are listening when your real attention is given to something.
But unfortunately most of us listen through a screen of resistance.
We are screened with prejudices, whether religious or spiritual, psychological or scientific; or with our daily worries, desires and fears.
And with these for a screen, we listen.
Therefore, we listen really to our own noise, to our own sound, not to what is being said.
It is extremely difficult to put aside our training, our prejudices, our inclination, our resistance, and, reaching beyond the verbal expression, to listen so that we understand instantaneously.
That is going to be one of our difficulties.
If, during this discourse, anything is said which is opposed to your way of thinking and belief, just listen; do not resist.
You have to discover it; and to discover, there must be a state of mind in which there is direct perception.
There is no direct perception when there is a resistance, a safeguard, a protection.
Understanding comes through being aware of what is.
To know exactly what is, the real, the actual, without interpreting it, without condemning or justifying it, is, surely, the beginning of wisdom.
It is only when we begin to interpret, to translate according to our conditioning, according to our prejudice, that we miss the truth.
After all, it is like research.
To know what something is, what it is exactly, requires research—you cannot translate it according to your moods.
Similarly, if we can look, observe, listen, be aware of what is, exactly, then the problem is solved.
And that is what we are trying to do in all these discourses.
I am going to point out to you what is, and not translate it according to my fancy; nor should you translate it or interpret it according to your background or training.
To acknowledge, to be aware of, to get at that which is, puts an end to struggle.
If I know that I am a liar, and it is a fact which I recognize, then the struggle is over.
To acknowledge, to be aware of what one is, is already the beginning of wisdom, the beginning of understanding, which releases you from time.
To bring in the quality of time—time, not in the chronological sense, but as the medium, as the psychological process, the process of the mind—is destructive, and creates confusion.
So, we can have understanding of what is when we recognize it without condemnation, without justification, without identification.
To know that one is in a certain condition, in a certain state, is already a process of liberation; but a man who is not aware of his condition, of his struggle, tries to be something other than he is, which brings about habit.
So, then, let us keep in mind that we want to examine what is, to observe and be aware of exactly what is the actual, without giving it any slant, without giving it an interpretation.
It needs an extraordinarily astute mind, an extraordinarily pliable heart, to be aware of and to follow what is; because what is is constantly moving, constantly undergoing a transformation, and if the mind is tethered to belief, to knowledge, it ceases to pursue, it ceases to follow the swift movement of what is.
What is is not static, surely—it is constantly moving, as you will see if you observe it very closely.
To follow it, you need a very swift mind and a pliable heart—which are denied when the mind is static, fixed in a belief, in a prejudice, in an identification; and a mind and heart that are dry cannot follow easily, swiftly, that which is.
One is aware, I think, without too much discussion, too much verbal expression, that there is individual as well as collective chaos, confusion and misery.
It is not only in India, but right throughout the world; in China, America, England, Germany, all over the world, there is confusion, mounting sorrow.
There is extraordinarily acute suffering, and it is not individual only but collective.
There is suffering, political, social, religious; our whole psychological being is confused, and all the leaders, political and religious, have failed us; all the books have lost theirsignificance.
You may go to the Bhagavad Gita or the Bible or the latest treatise on politics or psychology, and you will find that they have lost that ring, that quality of truth; they have become mere words.
You yourself, who are the repeater of those words, are confused and uncertain, and mere repetition of words conveys nothing.
Therefore the words and the books have lost their value; that is, if you quote the Bible, or Marx, or the Bhagavad Gita, as you who quote it are yourself uncertain, confused, your repetition becomes a lie; because what is written there becomes mere propaganda, and propaganda is not truth.
So when you repeat, you have ceased to understand your own state of being.
You are merely covering with words of authority your own confusion.
We read books but we never write books.
It has become our tradition, our national and universal habit, to be the spectators, to look on at a football game, to watch the public politicians and orators.
We are merely the outsiders, looking on, and we have lost the creative capacity.
But if you are merely observing, if you are merely spectators, you will lose entirely the significance of this discourse, because this is not a lecture which you are to listen to from force of habit.
I am not going to give you information which you can pick up in an encyclopædia.
What we are trying to do is to follow each other’s thoughts, to pursue as far as we can, as profoundly as we can, the intimations, the responses of our own feelings.
So please find out what your response is to this cause, to this suffering; not what somebody else’s words are, but how you yourself respond.
Your response is one of indifference if you benefit by the suffering, by the chaos, if you derive profit from it, either economic, social,political or psychological.
Therefore you do not mind if this chaos continues.
Surely, the more trouble there is in the world, the more chaos, the more one seeks security.
More and more sects are being formed, more and more ‘isms’ are springing up all over the world.
Because the more confusion there is, the more you want a leader, somebody who will guide you out of this mess, so you turn to the religious books, or to one of the latest teachers; or else you act and respond according to a system which appears to solve the problem, a system either of the left or of the right.
That is exactly what is happening.
The moment you are aware of confusion, of exactly what is, you try to escape from it.
Those sects which offer you a system for the solution of suffering, economic, social or religious, are the worst; because then system becomes important and not man—whether it be a religious system, or a system of the left or of the right.
System becomes important, the philosophy, the idea, becomes important, and not man; and for the sake of the idea, of the ideology, you are willing to sacrifice all mankind, which is exactly what is happening in the world.
This is not merely my interpretation; if you observe, you will find that is exactly what is happening.
The system has become important.
Therefore, as the system has become important, men, you and I, lose significance; and the controllers of the system, whether religious or social, whether of the left or of the right, assume authority, assume power, and therefore sacrifice you, the individual.
What happens when we have no other values except the value of the things of the senses, the value of the products of the mind, of the hand or of the machine?
You do not have to quote books to find out that your values, your riches, your economic and social existence are based on things made by the hand or by the mind.
So we live and function and have our being steeped in sensual values, which means that things, the things of the mind, the things of the hand and of the machine, have become important; and when things become important, belief becomes predominantly significant—which is exactly what is happening in the world, is it not?
Thus, giving more and more significance to the values of the senses brings about confusion; and, being in confusion, we try to escape from it through various forms, whether religious, economic or social, or through ambition, through power, through the search for reality.
Truth is in what is—and that is the beauty of it.
But the moment you conceive it, the moment you seek it, you begin to struggle; and a man who struggles cannot understand.
That is why we have to be still, observant, passively aware.
We see that our living, our action, is always within the field of destruction, within the field of sorrow; like a wave, confusion and chaos always overtake us.
There is no interval in the confusion of existence.
Whatever we do at present seems to lead to chaos, seems to lead to sorrow and unhappiness.
Look at your own life and you will see that our living is always on the border of sorrow.
Our work, our social activity, our politics, the various gatherings of nations to stop war, all produce further war.
Destruction follows in the wake of living; whatever we do leads to death.
That is what is actually taking place.
But they have never prevented sorrow, they have never stopped confusion.
Confusion goes on, sorrow goes on.
If you, seeing this social and economic confusion, this chaos, this misery, withdraw into what is called the religious life and abandon the world, you may feel that you are joining these great teachers; but the world goes on with its chaos, its misery and destruction, the everlasting suffering of its rich and poor.
So, our problem, yours and mine, is whether we can step out of this misery instantaneously.
Surely that is our problem.
War is probably coming, more destructive, more appalling in its form.
Surely we cannot prevent it, because the issues are much too strong and too close.
Perception can take place only in the present; but if you say, “I will do it to-morrow”, the wave of confusion overtakes you, and you are then always involved in confusion.
I say it can be done and must be done, not based on supposition or belief.
To bring about this extraordinary revolution—which is not the revolution to get rid of the capitalists and install another group—to bring about this wonderful transformation, which is the only true revolution, is the problem.
What is generally called revolution is merely the modification or the continuance of the right according to the ideas of the left.
The left, after all, is the continuation of the right in a modified form.
If the right is based on sensual values, the left is but a continuance of the same sensual values, different only in degree or expression.
Therefore true revolution can take place only when you, the individual, become aware in your relationship to another.
Surely what you are in your relationship to another, to your wife, your child, your boss, your neighbour, is society.
Society by itself is non-existent.
Society is what you and I, in our relationship, have created; it is the outward projection of all our own inward psychological states.
So if you and I do not understand ourselves, merely transforming the outer, which is the projection of the inner, has no significance whatsoever; that is there can be no significant alteration or modification in society so long as I do not understand myself in relationship to you.
Being confused in my relationship, I create a society which is the replica, the outward expression of what I am.
This is an obvious fact, which we can discuss.
We can discuss whether society, the outward expression, has produced me, or whether I have produced society.
Until I, in my relationship to you, understand myself, I am the cause of chaos, misery, destruction, fear, brutality.
Understanding myself is not a matter of time; I can understand myself at this very moment.
If I say, “I shall understand myself to-morrow”, I am bringing in chaos and misery, my action is destructive.
The moment I say that I “shall” understand, I bring in the time element and so am already caught up in the wave of confusion and destruction.
Understanding is now, not to-morrow.
To-morrow is for the lazy mind, the sluggish mind, the mind that is not interested.
When you are interested in something, you do it instantaneously, there is immediate understanding, immediate transformation.
If you do not change now, you will never change, because the change that takes place to-morrow is merely a modification, it is not transformation.
Transformation can only take place immediately; the revolution is now, not to-morrow.
When that happens, you are completely without a problem, for then the self is not worried about itself; then you are beyond the wave of destruction.
WHAT IS IT THAT most of us are seeking?
What is it that each one of us wants?
Probably most of us are seeking some kind of happiness, some kind of peace; in a world that is ridden with turmoil, wars, contention, strife, we want a refuge where there can be some peace.
I think that is what most of us want.
So we pursue, go from one leader to another, from one religious organization to another, from one teacher to another.
Now, is it that we are seeking happiness or is it that we are seeking gratification of some kind from which we hope to derive happiness?
There is a difference between happiness and gratification.
Can you seek happiness?
Perhaps you can find gratification but surely you cannot find happiness.
Happiness is derivative; it is a by-product of something else.
So, before we give our minds and hearts to something which demands a great deal of earnestness, attention, thought, care, we must find out, must we not?, what it is that we are seeking;
whether it is happiness, or gratification.
I am afraid most of us are seeking gratification.
We want to be gratified, we want to find a sense of fullness at the end of our search.
After all, if one is seeking peace one can find it very easily.
One can devote oneself blindly to some kind of cause, to an idea, and take shelter there.
Surely that does not solve the problem.
Mere isolation in an enclosing idea is not a release from conflict.
If we are clear on that matter, then we don’t have to go anywhere, to any teacher, to any church, to any organization.
Therefore our difficulty is, to be clear in ourselves regarding our intention, is it not?
Can we be clear?
And does that clarity come through searching, through trying to find out what others say, from the highest teacher to the ordinary preacher in a church round the corner?
Have you got to go to somebody to find out?
Yet that is what we are doing, is it not?
We read innumerable books, we attend many meetings and discuss, we join various organizations—trying thereby to find a remedy to the conflict, to the miseries in our lives.
Do we not seek, through all this confusion, something permanent, something lasting, something which we call real, God, truth, what you like—the name doesn’t matter, the word is not the thing, surely.
So don’t let us be caught in words.
Leave that to the professional lecturers.
There is a search for something permanent, is there not?
, in most of us—something we can cling to, something which will give us assurance, a hope, a lasting enthusiasm, a lasting certainty, because in ourselves we are so uncertain.
We do not know ourselves.
We know a lot about facts, what the books have said; but we do not know for ourselves, we do not have a direct experience.
And what is it that we call permanent?
What is it that we are seeking, which will, or which we hope will give us permanency?
Are we not seeking lasting happiness, lasting gratification, lasting certainty?
We want something that will endure everlastingly, which will gratify us.
If we strip ourselves of all the words and phrases, and actually look at it, this is what we want.
We want permanent pleasure, permanent gratification—which we call truth, God or what you will.
Very well, we want pleasure.
Perhaps that may be putting it very crudely, but that is actually what we want—knowledge that will give us pleasure, experience that will give us pleasure, a gratification that will not wither away by tomorrow.
And we have experimented with various gratifications, and they have all faded away; and we hope now to find permanent gratification in reality, in God.
Surely, that is what we are all seeking—the clever ones and the stupid ones, the theorist and the factual person who is striving after something.
And is there permanent gratification?
Is there something which will endure?
When you say, “I am seeking permanent happiness”—God, or truth, or what you like—must you not also understand the thing that is searching, the searcher, the seeker?
Because there may be no such thing as permanent security, permanent happiness.
Truth may be something entirely different; and I think it is utterly different from what you can see, conceive, formulate.
Therefore, before we seek something permanent, is it not obviously necessary to understand the seeker?
Is the seeker different from the thing he seeks?
When you say, “I am seeking happiness”, is the seeker different from the object of his search?
Is the thinker different from the thought?
Are they not a joint phenomenon, rather than separate processes?
Therefore it is essential, is it not?
, to understand the seeker, before you try to find out what it is he is seeking.
So we have to come to the point when we ask ourselves, really earnestly and profoundly, if peace, happiness, reality, God, or what you will, can be given to us by someone else.
Can this incessant search, this longing, give us that extraordinary sense of reality, that creative being, which comes when we really understand ourselves?
After all, that is the main issue, is it not?
, that so long as I do not understand myself, I have no basis for thought, and all my search will be in vain.
I can escape into illusions, I can run away from contention, strife, struggle; I can worship another; I can look for my salvation through somebody else.
But so long as I am ignorant of myself, so long as I am unaware of the total process of myself, I have no basis for thought, for affection, for action.
But that is the last thing we want: to know ourselves.
Surely that is the only foundation on which we can build.
But, before we can build, before we can transform, before we can condemn or destroy, we must know that which we are.
To go out seeking, changing teachers, gurus, practising yoga, breathing, performing rituals, following Masters and all the rest of it, is utterly useless, is it not?
It has no meaning, even though the very people whom we follow may say: “Study yourself”, because what we are, the world is.
If we are petty, jealous, vain, greedy—that is what we create about us, that is the society in which we live.
It seems to me that before we set out on a journey to find reality, to find God, before we can act, before we can have any relationship with another, which is society, it is essential that we begin to understand ourselves first.
And it does not mean, obviously, that self-knowledge is opposed to, or isolated from, relationship.
It does not mean, obviously, emphasis on the individual, the me, as opposed to the mass, as opposed to another.
Now without knowing yourself, without knowing your own way of thinking and why you think certain things, without knowing the background of your conditioning and why you have certain beliefs about art and religion, about your country and your neighbour and about yourself, how can you think truly about anything?
Without knowing your background, without knowing the substance of your thought and whence it comes—surely your search is utterly futile, your action has no meaning, has it?
Whether you are an American or a Hindu or whatever your religion is has no meaning either.
Before we can find out what the end-purpose of life is, what it all means—wars, national antagonisms, conflicts, the whole mess—we must begin with ourselves, must we not?
It sounds so simple, but it is extremely difficult.
To follow oneself, to see how one’s thought operates, one has to be extraordinarily alert, so that as one begins to be more and more alert to the intricacies of one’s own thinking and responses and feelings, one begins to have a greater awareness, not only of oneself but of another with whom one is in relationship.
To know oneself is to study oneself in action, which is relationship.
The difficulty is that we are so impatient; we want to get on, we want to reach an end, and so we have neither the time nor the occasion to give ourselves the opportunity to study, to observe.
Alternatively we have committed ourselves to various activities—to earning a livelihood, to rearing children—or have taken on certain responsibilities of various organizations; we have so committed ourselves in different ways that we have hardly any time for self-reflection, to observe, to study.
So really the responsibility of the reaction depends on oneself, not on another.
The pursuit, all the world over, of gurus and their systems, reading the latest books on this and that, and so on, seems to me so utterly empty, so utterly futile, for you may wander all over the earth but you have to come back to yourself.
And, as most of us are totally unaware of ourselves, it is extremely difficult to begin to see clearly the process of our thinking and feeling and acting.
The more you know yourself, the more clarity there is.
Self-knowledge has no end—you don’t come to an achievement, you don’t come to a conclusion.
It is an endless river.
As one studies it, as one goes into it more and more, one finds peace.
Only when the mind is tranquil—through self-knowledge and not through imposed self-discipline—only then, in that tranquillity, in that silence, can reality come into being.
It is only then that there can be bliss, that there can be creative action.
And it seems to me that without this understanding, without this experience, merely to read books, to attend talks, to do propaganda, is so infantile—just an activity without much meaning; whereas if one is able to understand oneself, and thereby bring about that creative happiness, that experiencing of something that is not of the mind, then perhaps there can be a transformation in the immediate relationship about us and so in the world in which we live.
THE PROBLEM THAT confronts most of us is whether the individual is merely the instrument of society or the end of society.
Are you and I as individuals to be used, directed, educated, controlled, shaped to a certain pattern by society and government; or does society, the State, exist for the individual?
Is the individual the end of society; or is he merely a puppet to be taught, exploited, butchered as an instrument of war?
That is the problem that is confronting most of us.
That is the problem of the world; whether the individual is a mere instrument of society, a plaything of influences to be moulded; or whether society exists for the individual.
How are you going to find this out?
It is a serious problem, isn’t it?
If the individual is merely an instrument of society, then society is much more important than the individual.
If that is true, then we must give up individuality and work for society; our whole educational system must be entirely revolutionized and the individual turned into an instrument to be used and destroyed, liquidated, got rid of.
But if society exists for the individual, then the function of society is not to make him conform to any pattern but to give him the feel, the urge of freedom.
So we have to find out which is false.
How would you inquire into this problem?
It is a vital problem, isn’t it?
It is not dependent on any ideology, either of the left or of the right; and if it is dependent on an ideology, then it is merely a matter of opinion.
Ideas always breed enmity, confusion, conflict.
If you depend on books of the left or of the right or on sacred books, then you depend on mere opinion, whether of Buddha, of Christ, of capitalism, communism or what you will.
They are ideas, not truth.
A fact can never be denied.
Opinion about fact can be denied.
If we can discover what the truth of the matter is, we shall be able to act independently of opinion.
Is it not, therefore, necessary to discard what others have said?
The opinion of the leftist or other leaders is the outcome of their conditioning, so if you depend for your discovery on what is found in books, you are merely bound by opinion.
It is not a matter of knowledge.
How is one to discover the truth of this?
On that we will act.
To find the truth of this, there must be freedom from all propaganda, which means you are capable of looking at the problem independently of opinion.
The whole task of education is to awaken the individual.
To see the truth of this, you will have to be very clear, which means you cannot depend on a leader.
When you choose a leader you do so out of confusion, and so your leaders are also confused, and that is what is happening in the world.
Therefore you cannot look to your leader for guidance or help.
A mind that wishes to understand a problem must not only understand the problem completely, wholly, but must be able to follow it swiftly, because the problem is never static.
The problem is always new, whether it is a problem of starvation, a psychological problem, or any problem.
Any crisis is always new; therefore, to understand it, a mind must always be fresh, clear, swift in its pursuit.
I think most of us realize the urgency of an inward revolution, which alone can bring about a radical transformation of the outer, of society.
This is the problem with which I myself and all seriously-intentioned people are occupied.
How to bring about a fundamental, a radical transformation in society, is our problem; and this transformation of the outer cannot take place without inner revolution.
Since society is always static, any action, any reform which is accomplished without this inward revolution becomes equally static; so there is no hope without this constant inward revolution, because, without it, outer action becomes repetitive, habitual.
The action of relationship between you and another, between you and me, is society; and that society becomes static, it has no life-giving quality, so long as there is not this constant inward revolution, a creative, psychological transformation; and it is because there is not this constant inward revolution that society is always becoming static, crystallized, and has therefore constantly to be broken up.
What is the relationship between yourself and the misery, the confusion, in and around you?
Surely this confusion, this misery, did not come into being by itself.
You and I have created it, not a capitalist nor a communist nor a fascist society, but you and I have created it in our relationship with each other.
What you are within has been projected without, on to the world; what you are, what you think and what you feel, what you do in your everyday existence, is projected outwardly, and that constitutes the world.
If we are miserable, confused, chaotic within, by projection that becomes the world, that becomes society, because the relationship between yourself and myself, between myself and another is society—society is the product of our relationship —and if our relationship is confused, egocentric, narrow, limited, national, we project that and bring chaos into the world.
What you are, the world is.
So your problem is the world’s problem.
Surely, this is a simple and basic fact, is it not?
In our relationship with the one or the many we seem somehow to overlook this point all the time.
We want to bring about alteration through a system or through a revolution in ideas or values based on a system, forgetting that it is you and I who create society, who bring about confusion or order by the way in which we live.
So we must begin near, that is we must concern ourselves with our daily existence, with our daily thoughts and feelings and actions which are revealed in the manner of earning our livelihood and in our relationship with ideas or beliefs.
This is our daily existence, is it not?
We are concerned with livelihood, getting jobs, earning money; we are concerned with the relationship with our family or with our neighbours, and we are concerned with ideas and with beliefs.
Now, if you examine our occupation, it is fundamentally based on envy, it is not just a means of earning a livelihood.
Society is so constructed that it is a process of constant conflict, constant becoming; it is based on greed, on envy, envy of your superior; the clerk wanting to become the manager, which shows that he is not just concerned with earning a livelihood, a means of subsistence, but with acquiring position and prestige.
This attitude naturally creates havoc in society, in relationship, but if you and I were only concerned with livelihood we should find out the right means of earning it, a means not based on envy.
Envy is one of the most destructive factors in relationship because envy indicates the desire for power, for position, and it ultimately leads to politics; both are closely related.
The clerk, when he seeks to become a manager, becomes a factor in the creation of power-politics which produce war; so he is directly responsible for war.
What is our relationship based on?
The relationship between yourself and myself, between yourself and another —which is society—what is it based on?
Surely not on love, though we talk about it.
It is not based on love, because if there were love there would be order, there would be peace, happiness between you and me.
But in that relationship between you and me there is a great deal of ill-will which assumes the form of respect.
If we were both equal in thought, in feeling, there would be no respect, there would be no ill-will, because we would be two individuals meeting, not as disciple and teacher, nor as the husband dominating the wife, nor as the wife dominating the husband.
When there is ill-will there is a desire to dominate which arouses jealousy, anger, passion, all of which in our relationship creates constant conflict from which we try to escape, and this produces further chaos, further misery.
For what is stupidity?
Stupidity is the giving of wrong values to those things which the mind creates, or to those things which the hands produce.
Most of our thoughts spring from the self-protective instinct, do they not?
Our ideas, oh, so many of them, do they not receive the wrong significance, one which they have not in themselves?
Therefore when we believe in any form, whether religious, economic or social, when we believe in God, in ideas, in a social system which separates man from man, in nationalism and so on, surely we are giving a wrong significance to belief, which indicates stupidity, for belief divides people, doesn’t unite people.
So we see that by the way we live we can produce order or chaos, peace or conflict, happiness or misery.
So our problem, is it not?
, is whether there can be a society which is static, and at the same time an individual in whom this constant revolution is taking place.
That is, revolution in society must begin with the inner, psychological transformation of the individual.
Most of us want to see a radical transformation in the social structure.
That is the whole battle that is going on in the world—to bring about a social revolution through communistic or any other means.
Now if there is a social revolution, that is an action with regard to the outer structure of man, however radical that social revolution may be its very nature is static if there is no inward revolution of the individual, no psychological transformation.
Therefore to bring about a society that is not repetitive, nor static, not disintegrating, a society that is constantly alive, it is imperative that there should be a revolution in the psychological structure of the individual, for without inward, psychological revolution, mere transformation of the outer has very little significance.
That is society is always becoming crystallized, static, and is therefore always disintegrating.
However much and however wisely legislation may be promulgated, society is always in the process of decay because revolution must take place within, not merely outwardly.
I think it is important to understand this and not slur over it.
Outward action, when accomplished, is over, is static; if the relationship between individuals, which is society, is not the outcome of inward revolution, then the social structure, being static, absorbs the individual and therefore makes him equally static, repetitive.
Realizing this, realizing the extraordinary significance of this fact, there can be no question of agreement or disagreement.
It is a fact that society is always crystallizing and absorbing the individual and that constant, creative revolution can only be in the individual, not in society, not in the outer.
That is creative revolution can take place only in individual relationship, which is society.
We can observe it as we go down the streets.
We do not need great historians to tell us the fact that our society is crumbling; and there must be new architects, new builders, to create a new society.
The structure must be built on a new foundation, on newly discovered facts and values.
Such architects do not yet exist.
There are no builders, none who, observing, becoming aware of the fact that the structure is collapsing, are transforming themselves into architects.
That is our problem.
We see society crumbling, disintegrating; and it is we, you and I, who have to be the architects.
You and I have to rediscover the values and build on a more fundamental, lasting foundation; because if we look to the professional architects, the political and religious builders, we shall be precisely in the same position as before.
Because you and I are not creative, we have reduced society to this chaos, so you and I have to be creative because the problem is urgent; you and I must be aware of the causes of the collapse of society and create a new structure based not on mere imitation but on our creative understanding.
Now this implies, does it not?, negative thinking.
Negative thinking is the highest form of understanding.
That is in order to understand what is creative thinking, we must approach the problem negatively, because a positive approach to the problem—which is that you and I must become creative in order to build a new structure of society—will be imitative.
To understand that which is crumbling, we must investigate it, examine it negatively—not with a positive system, a positive formula, a positive conclusion.
Why is society crumbling, collapsing, as it surely is?
One of the fundamental reasons is that the individual, you, has ceased to be creative.
I will explain what I mean.
You and I have become imitative, we are copying, outwardly and inwardly.
Outwardly, when learning a technique, when communicating with each other on the verbal level, naturally there must be some imitation, copy.
I copy words.
To become an engineer, I must first learn the technique, then use the technique to build a bridge.
There must be a certain amount of imitation, copying, in outward technique, but when there is inward, psychological imitation surely we cease to be creative.
I have ceased to be a real individual; psychologically, I have become a mere repetitive machine with certain conditioned responses, whether those of the Hindu, the Christian, the Buddhist, the German or the Englishman.
Our responses are conditioned according to the pattern of society, whether it is eastern or western, religious or materialistic.
So one of the fundamental causes of the disintegration of society is imitation, and one of the disintegrating factors is the leader, whose very essence is imitation.
In order to understand the nature of disintegrating society is it not important to inquire whether you and I, the individual, can be creative?
We can see that when there is imitation there must be disintegration; when there is authority there must be copying.
And since our whole mental, psychological make-up is based on authority, there must be freedom from authority, to be creative.
Have you not noticed that in moments of creativeness, those rather happy moments of vital interest, there is no sense of repetition, no sense of copying?
Such moments are always new, fresh, creative, happy.
So we see that one of the fundamental causes of the disintegration of society is copying, which is the worship of authority.
As I was pointing out, the solution is not to be found through conferences, blue-prints, or through the substitution of new leaders for old, and so on.
The solution obviously lies in the creator of the problem, in the creator of the mischief, of the hate and of the enormous misunderstanding that exists between human beings.
The creator of this mischief, the creator of these problems, is the individual, you and I, not the world as we think of it.
The world is your relationship with another.
The world is not something separate from you and me; the world, society, is the relationship that we establish or seek to establish between each other.
So you and I are the problem, and not the world, because the world is the projection of ourselves and to understand the world we must understand ourselves.
The world is not separate from us; we are the world, and our problems are the world’s problems.
This cannot be repeated too often, because we are so sluggish in our mentality that we think the world’s problems are not our business, that they have to be resolved by the United Nations or by substituting new leaders for the old.
It is a very dull mentality that thinks like that, because we are responsible for this frightful misery and confusion in the world, this ever-impending war.
To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves; and what is important in beginning with ourselves is the intention.
The intention must be to understand ourselves and not to leave it to others to transform themselves or to bring about a modified change through revolution, either of the left or of the right.
It is important to understand that this is our responsibility, yours and mine; because, however small may be the world we live in, if we can transform ourselves, bring about a radically different point of view in our daily existence, then perhaps we shall affect the world at large, the extended relationship with others.
As I said, we are going to try and find out the process of understanding ourselves, which is not an isolating process.
It is not withdrawal from the world, because you cannot live in isolation.
To be is to be related, and there is no such thing as living in isolation.
It is the lack of right relationship that brings about conflicts, misery and strife; however small our world may be, if we can transform our relationship in that narrow world, it will be like a wave extending outward all the time.
I think it is important to see that point, that the world is our relationship, however narrow; and if we can bring a transformation there, not a superficial but a radical transformation, then we shall begin actively to transform the world.
To find these true values which will bring about a radical revolution, a transformation or a regeneration, it is essential to understand oneself.
Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, and therefore the beginning of transformation or regeneration.
To understand oneself there must be the intention to understand—and that is where our difficulty comes in.
Although most of us are discontented, we desire to bring about a sudden change, our discontent is canalized merely to achieve a certain result; being discontented, we either seek a different job or merely succumb to environment.
Therefore it is important to discover these things for ourselves, because self-knowledge cannot be given to us by another, it is not to be found through any book.
We must discover, and to discover there must be the intention, the search, the inquiry.
So long as that intention to find out, to inquire deeply, is weak or does not exist, mere assertion or a casual wish to find out about oneself is of very little significance.
To transform oneself, self-knowledge is essential; without knowing what you are, there is no basis for right thought, and without knowing yourself there cannot be transformation.
One must know oneself as one is, not as one wishes to be which is merely an ideal and therefore fictitious, unreal; it is only that which is that can be transformed, not that which you wish to be.
If you would follow anything it is no good being tethered.
To know yourself, there must be the awareness, the alertness of mind in which there is freedom from all beliefs, from all idealization because beliefs and ideals only give you a colour, perverting true perception.
If you want to know what you are you cannot imagine or have belief in something which you are not.
If I am greedy, envious, violent, merely having an ideal of non-violence, of non-greed, is of little value.
But to know that one is greedy or violent, to know and understand it, requires an extraordinary perception, does it not?
It demands honesty, clarity of thought, whereas to pursue an ideal away from what is is an escape; it prevents you from discovering and acting directly upon what you are.
The understanding of what you are, whatever it be—ugly or beautiful, wicked or mischievous—the understanding of what you are, without distortion, is the beginning of virtue.
Virtue is essential, for it gives freedom.
It is only in virtue that you can discover, that you can live—not in the cultivation of a virtue, which merely brings about respectability, not understanding and freedom.
There is a difference between being virtuous and becoming virtuous.
Being virtuous comes through the understanding of what is, whereas becoming virtuous is postponement, the covering up of what is with what you would like to be.
Therefore in becoming virtuous you are avoiding action directly upon what is.
This process of avoiding what is through the cultivation of the ideal is considered virtuous; but if you look at it closely and directly you will see that it is nothing of the kind.
It is merely a postponement of coming face to face with what is.
Virtue is not the becoming of what is not; virtue is the understanding of what is and therefore the freedom from what is.
Virtue is essential in a society that is rapidly disintegrating.
In order to create a new world, a new structure away from the old, there must be freedom to discover; and to be free, there must be virtue, for without virtue there is no freedom.
Can the immoral man who is striving to become virtuous ever know virtue?
The man who is not moral can never be free, and therefore he can never find out what reality is.
Reality can be found only in understanding what is; and to understand what is, there must be freedom, freedom from the fear of what is.
To understand that process there must be the intention to know what is, to follow every thought, feeling and action; and to understand what is is extremely difficult, because what is is never still, never static, it is always in movement.
The what is is what you are, not what you would like to be; it is not the ideal, because the ideal is fictitious, but it is actually what you are doing, thinking and feeling from moment to moment.
What is is the actual, and to understand the actual requires awareness, a very alert, swift mind.
But if we begin to condemn what is, if we begin to blame or resist it, then we shall not understand its movement.
If I want to understand somebody, I cannot condemn him: I must observe, study him.
I must love the very thing I am studying.
If you want to understand a child, you must love and not condemn him.
You must play with him, watch his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his ways of behaviour; but if you merely condemn, resist or blame him, there is no comprehension of the child.
Similarly, to understand what is, one must observe what one thinks, feels and does from moment to moment.
Any other action, any ideal or ideological action, is not the actual; it is merely a wish, a fictitious desire to be something other than what is.
To understand what is requires a state of mind in which there is no identification or condemnation, which means a mind that is alert and yet passive.
We are in that state when we really desire to understand something; when the intensity of interest is there, that state of mind comes into being.
When one is interested in understanding what is, the actual state of the mind, one does not need to force, discipline, or control it; on the contrary, there is passive alertness, watchfulness.
This state of awareness comes when there is interest, the intention to understand.
The fundamental understanding of oneself does not come through knowledge or through the accumulation of experiences, which is merely the cultivation of memory.
The understanding of oneself is from moment to moment; if we merely accumulate knowledge of the self, that very knowledge prevents further understanding, because accumulated knowledge and experience becomes the centre through which thought focuses and has its being.
The world is not different from us and our activities because it is what we are which creates the problems of the world; the difficulty with the majority of us is that we do not know ourselves directly, but seek a system, a method, a means of operation by which to solve the many human problems.
Now is there a means, a system, of knowing oneself?
Any clever person, any philosopher, can invent a system, a method; but surely the following of a system will merely produce a result created by that system, will it not?
That is by following a method, a system, a means through which to know myself, I shape my thinking, my activities, according to a pattern; but the following of a pattern is not the understanding of oneself.
Therefore there is no method for self-knowledge.
Seeking a method invariably implies the desire to attain some result—and that is what we all want.
We follow authority—if not that of a person, then of a system, of an ideology—because we want a result which will be satisfactory, which will give us security.
We really do not want to understand ourselves, our impulses and reactions, the whole process of our thinking, the conscious as well as the unconscious; we would rather pursue a system which assures us of a result.
But the pursuit of a system is invariably the outcome of our desire for security, for certainty, and the result is obviously not the understanding of oneself.
When we follow a method, we must have authorities—the teacher, the guru, the saviour, the Master—who will guarantee us what we desire; and surely that is not the way to self-knowledge.
Authority prevents the understanding of oneself, does it not?
Under the shelter of an authority, a guide, you may have temporarily a sense of security, a sense of well-being, but that is not the understanding of the total process of oneself.
Authority in its very nature prevents the full awareness of oneself and therefore ultimately destroys freedom; in freedom alone can there be creativeness.
There can be creativeness only through self-knowledge.
Most of us are not creative; we are repetitive machines, mere gramophone records playing over and over again certain songs of experience, certain conclusions and memories, either our own or those of another.
Such repetition is not creative being—but it is what we want.
Because we want to be inwardly secure, we are constantly seeking methods and means for this security, and thereby we create authority, the worship of another, which destroys comprehension, that spontaneous tranquillity of mind in which alone there can be a state of creativeness.
Surely our difficulty is that most of us have lost this sense of creativeness.
To be creative does not mean that we must paint pictures or write poems and become famous.
That is not creativeness—it is merely the capacity to express an idea, which the public applauds or disregards.
Capacity and creativeness should not be confused.
Capacity is not creativeness.
Creativeness is quite a different state of being, is it not?
It is a state in which the self is absent, in which the mind is no longer a focus of our experiences, our ambitions, our pursuits and our desires.
It is only when the self is not that there is creativeness—that state of being in which alone there can be reality, the creator of all things.
But that state cannot be conceived or imagined, it cannot be formulated or copied, it cannot be attained through any system, through any philosophy, through any discipline; on the contrary, it comes into being only through understanding the total process of oneself.
The understanding of oneself is not a result, a culmination; it is seeing oneself from moment to moment in the mirror of relationship—one’s relationship to property, to things, to people and to ideas.
But we find it difficult to be alert, to be aware, and we prefer to dull our minds by following a method, by accepting authorities, superstitions and gratifying theories; so our minds become weary, exhausted and insensitive.
Such a mind cannot be in a state of creativeness.
That state of creativeness comes only when the self, which is the process of recognition and accumulation, ceases to be; because, after all, consciousness as the ‘me’ is the centre of recognition, and recognition is merely the process of the accumulation of experience.
But we are all afraid to be nothing, because we all want to be something.
The little man wants to be a big man, the unvirtuous wants to be virtuous, the weak and obscure crave power, position and authority.
This is the incessant activity of the mind.
Such a mind cannot be quiet and therefore can never understand the state of creativeness.
In order to transform the world about us, with its misery, wars, unemployment, starvation, class divisions and utter confusion, there must be a transformation in ourselves.
To bring about a fundamental revolution in oneself, one must understand the whole process of one’s thought and feeling in relationship.
That is the only solution to all our problems—not to have more disciplines, more beliefs, more ideologies and more teachers.
If we can understand ourselves as we are from moment to moment without the process of accumulation, then we shall see how there comes a tranquillity that is not a product of the mind, a tranquillity that is neither imagined nor cultivated; and only in that state of tranquillity can there be creativeness.
I SHOULD LIKE TO discuss the problem of action.
This may be rather abstruse and difficult at the beginning but I hope that by thinking it over we shall be able to see the issue clearly, because our whole existence, our whole life, is a process of action.
Most of us live in a series of actions, of seemingly unrelated, disjointed actions, leading to disintegration, to frustration.
It is a problem that concerns each one of us, because we live by action and without action there is no life, there is no experience, there is no thinking.
Our life is a series of actions or a process of action at different levels of consciousness.
Consciousness is experiencing, naming and recording.
That is consciousness is challenge and response, which is experiencing, then terming or naming, and then recording, which is memory.
This process is action, is it not?
Consciousness is action; and without challenge, response, without experiencing, naming or terming, without recording, which is memory, there is no action.
Now action creates the actor.
That is the actor comes into being when action has a result, an end in view.
If there is no result in action, then there is no actor; but if there is an end or a result in view, then action brings about the actor.
Thus actor, action, and end or result, is a unitary process, a single process, which comes into being when action has an end in view.
Action towards a result is will; otherwise there is no will, is there?
The desire to achieve an end brings about will, which is the actor—I want to achieve, I want to write a book, I want to be a rich man, I want to paint a picture.
We are familiar with these three states: the actor, the action, and the end.
That is our daily existence.
I am just explaining what is; but we will begin to understand how to transform what is only when we examine it clearly, so that there is no illusion or prejudice, no bias with regard to it.
Now these three states which constitute experience—the actor, the action, and the result—are surely a process of becoming.
Otherwise there is no becoming, is there?
If there is no actor, and if there is no action towards an end, there is no becoming; but life as we know it, our daily life, is a process of becoming.
I am poor and I act with an end in view, which is to become rich.
I am ugly and I want to become beautiful.
Therefore my life is a process of becoming something.
The will to be is the will to become, at different levels of consciousness, in different states, in which there is challenge, response, naming and recording.
Now this becoming is strife, this becoming is pain, is it not?
It is a constant struggle: I am this, and I want to become that.
Therefore, then, the problem is: Is there not action without this becoming?
Is there not action without this pain, without this constant battle?
If there is no end, there is no actor, because action with an end in view creates the actor.
But can there be action without an end in view, and therefore no actor—that is without the desire for a result?
Such action is not a becoming, and therefore not a strife.
There is a state of action, a state of experiencing, without the experiencer and the experience.
This sounds rather philosophical but it is really quite simple.
Take a very simple example: you are angry.
In that moment of anger there is neither the experiencer nor the experience; there is only experiencing.
But the moment you come out of it, a split second after the experiencing, there is the experiencer and the experience, the actor and the action with an end in view—which is to get rid of or to suppress the anger.
We are in this state repeatedly, in the state of experiencing; but we always come out of it and give it a term, naming and recording it, and thereby giving continuity to becoming.
If we can understand action in the fundamental sense of the word then that fundamental understanding will affect our superficial activities also; but first we must understand the fundamental nature of action.
Now is action brought about by an idea?
Do you have an idea first and act afterwards?
Or does action come first and then, because action creates conflict, you build around it an idea?
Does action create the actor or does the actor come first?
It is very important to discover which comes first.
If the idea comes first, then action merely conforms to an idea, and therefore it is no longer action but imitation, compulsion according to an idea.
It is very important to realize this; because, as our society is mostly constructed on the intellectual or verbal level, the idea comes first with all of us and action follows.
Action is then the handmaid of an idea, and the mere construction of ideas is obviously detrimental to action.
Ideas breed further ideas, and when there is merely the breeding of ideas there is antagonism, and society becomes top-heavy with the intellectual process of ideation.
Our social structure is very intellectual; we are cultivating the intellect at the expense of every other factor of our being and therefore we are suffocated with ideas.
Can ideas ever produce action, or do ideas merely mould thought and therefore limit action?
When action is compelled by an idea, action can never liberate man.
It is extraordinarily important for us to understand this point.
If an idea shapes action, then action can never bring about the solution to our miseries because, before it can be put into action, we have first to discover how the idea comes into being.
The investigation of ideation, of the building up of ideas, whether of the socialists, the capitalists, the communists, or of the various religions, is of the utmost importance, especially when our society is at the edge of a precipice, inviting another catastrophe, another excision.
Those who are really serious in their intention to discover the human solution to our many problems must first understand this process of ideation.
What do we mean by an idea?
How does an idea come into being?
And can idea and action be brought together?
Suppose I have an idea and I wish to carry it out.
I seek a method of carrying out that idea, and we speculate, waste our time and energies in quarrelling over how the idea should be carried out.
So, it is really very important to find out how ideas come into being; and after discovering the truth of that we can discuss the question of action.
Without discussing ideas, merely to find out how to act has no meaning.
Now how do you get an idea—a very simple idea, it need not be philosophical, religious or economic?
Obviously it is a process of thought, is it not?
Idea is the outcome of a thought process.
Without a thought process, there can be no idea.
So I have to understand the thought process itself before I can understand its product, the idea.
What do we mean by thought?
When do you think?
Obviously thought is the result of a response, neurological or psychological, is it not?
It is the immediate response of the senses to a sensation, or it is psychological, the response of stored-up memory.
There is the immediate response of the nerves to a sensation, and there is the psychological response of stored-up memory, the influence of race, group, guru, family, tradition, and so on—all of which you call thought.
So the thought process is the response of memory, is it not?
You would have no thoughts if you had no memory; and the response of memory to a certain experience brings the thought process into action.
Say, for example, I have the stored-up memories of nationalism, calling myself a Hindu.
That reservoir of memories of past responses, actions, implications, traditions, customs, responds to the challenge of a Mussulman, a Buddhist or a Christian, and the response of memory to the challenge inevitably brings about a thought process.
Watch the thought process operating in yourself and you can test the truth of this directly.
When you meet the person, which is the challenge, the response is the memory of that insult.
So the response of memory, which is the thought process, creates an idea; therefore the idea is always conditioned—and this is important to understand.
That is to say the idea is the result of the thought process, the thought process is the response of memory, and memory is always conditioned.
Memory is always in the past, and that memory is given life in the present by a challenge.
Memory has no life in itself; it comes to life in the present when confronted by a challenge.
And all memory, whether dormant or active, is conditioned, is it not?
Therefore there has to be quite a different approach.
You have to find out for yourself, inwardly, whether you are acting on an idea, and if there can be action without ideation.
Let us find out what that is: action which is not based on an idea.
When do you act without ideation?
When is there an action which is not the result of experience?
An action based on experience is, as we said, limiting, and therefore a hindrance.
Action which is not the outcome of an idea is spontaneous when the thought process, which is based on experience, is not controlling action; which means that there is action independent of experience when the mind is not controlling action.
That is the only state in which there is understanding: when the mind, based on experience, is not guiding action: when thought, based on experience, is not shaping action.
What is action, when there is no thought process?
Can there be action without thought process?
We call that action.
There is the action of writing a poem, of painting, of governmental responsibilities, of social, environmental responses.
All are based on an idea or previous experience, shaping action.
But is there an action when there is no ideation?
Surely there is such action when the idea ceases; and the idea ceases only when there is love.
Love is not memory.
Love is not experience.
Love is not the thinking about the person that one loves, for then it is merely thought.
You cannot think of love.
You can think of the person you love or are devoted to—your guru, your image, your wife, your husband; but the thought, the symbol, is not the real which is love.
Therefore love is not an experience.
It is not the result of mentation, and there is no gap between love and action, as there is between idea and action.
Idea is always old, casting its shadow on the present and we are ever trying to build a bridge between action and idea.
When there is love—which is not mentation, which is not ideation, which is not memory, which is not the outcome of an experience, of a practised discipline—then that very love is action.
That is the only thing that frees.
So long as there is mentation, so long as there is the shaping of action by an idea which is experience, there can be no release; and so long as that process continues, all action is limited.
When the truth of this is seen, the quality of love, which is not mentation, which you cannot think about, comes into being.
One has to be aware of this total process, of how ideas come into being, how action springs from ideas, and how ideas control action and therefore limit action, depending on sensation.
It doesn’t matter whose ideas they are, whether from the left or from the extreme right.
So long as we cling to ideas, we are in a state in which there can be no experiencingat all.
Then we are merely living in the field of time—in the past, which gives further sensation, or in the future, which is another form of sensation.
It is only when the mind is free from idea that there can be experiencing.
Ideas are not truth; and truth is something that must be experienced directly, from moment to moment.
It is not an experience which you want—which is then merely sensation.
Then one shall know what truth is.
BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE are very intimately related to desire; and perhaps, if we can understand these two issues, we can see how desire works and understand its complexities.
One of the things, it seems to me, that most of us eagerly accept and take for granted is the question of beliefs.
I am not attacking beliefs.
What we are trying to do is to find out why we accept beliefs; and if we can understand the motives, the causation of acceptance, then perhaps we may be able not only to understand why we do it, but also be free of it.
One can see how political and religious beliefs, national and various other types of beliefs, do separate people, do create conflict, confusion, and antagonism—which is an obvious fact; and yet we are unwilling to give them up.
There is the Hindu belief, the Christian belief, the Buddhist—innumerable sectarian and national beliefs, various political ideologies, all contending with each other, trying to convert each other.
One can see, obviously, that belief is separating people, creating intolerance; is it possible to live without belief?
One can find that out only if one can study oneself in relationship to a belief.
Is it possible to live in this world without a belief—not change beliefs, not substitute one belief for another, but be entirely free from all beliefs, so that one meets life anew each minute?
This, after all, is the truth: to have the capacity of meeting everything anew, from moment to moment, without the conditioning reaction of the past, so that there is not the cumulative effect which acts as a barrier between oneself and that which is.
If you consider, you will see that one of the reasons for the desire to accept a belief is fear.
If we had no belief, what would happen to us?
Shouldn’t we be very frightened of what might happen?
If we had no pattern of action, based on a belief—either in God, or in communism, or in socialism, or in imperialism, or in some kind of religious formula, some dogma in which we are conditioned—we should feel utterly lost, shouldn’t we?
And is not this acceptance of a belief the covering up of that fear—the fear of being really nothing, of being empty?
After all, a cup is useful only when it is empty; and a mind that is filled with beliefs, with dogmas, with assertions, with quotations, is really an uncreative mind; it is merely a repetitive mind.
To escape from that fear—that fear of emptiness, that fear of loneliness, that fear of stagnation, of not arriving, not succeeding, not achieving, not being something, not becoming something—is surely one of the reasons, is it not?
, why we accept beliefs so eagerly and greedily.
And, through acceptance of belief, do we understand ourselves?
On the contrary, A belief, religious or political, obviously hinders the understanding of ourselves.
It acts as a screen through which we are looking at ourselves.
And can we look at ourselves without beliefs?
If we remove those beliefs, the many beliefs that one has, is there anything left to look at?
If we have no beliefs with which the mind has identified itself, then the mind, without identification, is capable of looking at itself as it is—and then, surely, there is the beginning of the understanding of oneself.
It is really a very interesting problem, this question of belief and knowledge.
The savages have innumerable superstitions, even in the modern world.
The more thoughtful, the more awake, the more alert are perhaps the less believing.
That is because belief binds, belief isolates; and we see that is so throughout the world, the economic and the political world, and also in the so-called spiritual world.
You believe there is God, and perhaps I believe that there is no God; or you believe in the complete state control of everything and of every individual, and I believe in private enterprise and all the rest of it; you believe that there is only one Saviour and through him you can achieve your goal, and I don’t believe so.
Thus you with your belief and I with mine are asserting ourselves.
Yet we both talk of love, of peace, of unity of mankind, of one life—which means absolutely nothing; because actually the very belief is a process of isolation.
You are a Brahmin, I a non-Brahmin; you are a Christian, I a Mussulman, and so on.
You talk of brotherhood and I also talk of the same brotherhood, love and peace; but in actuality we are separated, we are dividing ourselves.
A man who wants peace and who wants to create a new world, a happy world, surely cannot isolate himself through any form of belief.
Is that clear?
It may be verbally, but, if you see the significance and validity and the truth of it, it will begin to act.
We see that where there is a process of desire at work there must be the process of isolation through belief, because obviously you believe in order to be secure economically, spiritually, and also inwardly.
I am not talking of those people who believe for economic reasons, because they are brought up to depend on their jobs and therefore will be Catholics, Hindus—it does not matter what—as long as there is a job for them.
We are also not discussing those people who cling to a belief for the sake of convenience.
Perhaps with most of us it is equally so.
For convenience, we believe in certain things.
Brushing aside these economic reasons, we must go more deeply into it.
Take the people who believe strongly in anything, economic, social or spiritual; the process behind it is the psychological desire to be secure, is it not?
And then there is the desire to continue.
We are not discussing here whether there is or there is not continuity; we are only discussing the urge, the constant impulse to believe.
A man of peace, a man who would really understand the whole process of human existence, cannot be bound by a belief, can he?
He sees his desire at work as a means to being secure.
Please do not go to the other side and say that I am preaching non-religion.
That is not my point at all.
My point is that as long as we do not understand the process of desire in the form of belief, there must be contention, there must be conflict, there must be sorrow, and man will be against man—which is seen every day.
So if I perceive, if I am aware, that this process takes the form of belief, which is an expression of the craving for inward security, then my problem is not that I should believe this or that but that I should free myself from the desire to be secure.
Can the mind be free from the desire for security?
That is the problem—not what to believe and how much to believe.
These are merely expressions of the inward craving to be secure psychologically, to be certain about something, when everything is so uncertain in the world.
Can a mind, can a conscious mind, can a personality be free from this desire to be secure?
We want to be secure and therefore need the aid of our estates, our property and our family.
We want to be secure inwardly and also spiritually by erecting walls of belief, which are an indication of this craving to be certain.
Can you as an individual be free from this urge, this craving to be secure, which expresses itself in the desire to believe in something?
If we are not free of all that, we are a source of contention; we are not peacemaking; we have no love in our hearts.
Belief destroys; and this is seen in our everyday life.
Can I see myself when I am caught in this process of desire, which expresses itself in clinging to a belief?
Can the mind free itself from belief—not find a substitute for it but be entirely free from it?
You cannot verbally answer “yes” or “no” to this; but you can definitely give an answer if your intention is to become free from belief.
You then inevitably come to the point at which you are seeking the means to free yourself from the urge to be secure.
Obviously there is no security inwardly which, as you like to believe, will continue.
You like to believe there is a God who is carefully looking after your petty little things, telling you whom you should see, what you should do and how you should do it.
This is childish and immature thinking.
You think the Great Father is watching every one of us.
That is a mere projection of your own personal liking.
It is obviously not true.
Truth must be something entirely different.
Our next problem is that of knowledge.
Is knowledge necessary to the understanding of truth?
When I say “I know”, the implication is that there is knowledge.
Can such a mind be capable of investigating and searching out what is reality?
And besides, what is it we know, of which we are so proud?
Actually what is it we know?
We know information; we are full of information and experience based on our conditioning, our memory and our capacities.
When you say “I know”, what do you mean?
Either the acknowledgement that you know is the recognition of a fact, of certain information, or it is an experience that you have had.
The constant accumulation of information, the acquisition of various forms of knowledge, all constitutes the assertion “I know”; and you start translating what you have read, according to your background, your desire, your experience.
Your knowledge is a thing in which a process similar to the process of desire is at work.
Instead of belief we substitute knowledge.
“I know, I have had experience, it cannot be refuted; my experience is that, on that I completely rely”; these are indications of that knowledge.
But when you go behind it, analyse it, look at it more intelligently and carefully, you will find that the very assertion “I know” is another wall separating you and me.
Behind that wall you take refuge, seeking comfort, security.
Therefore the more knowledge a mind is burdened with, the less capable it is of understanding.
I do not know if you have ever thought of this problem of acquiring knowledge—whether knowledge does ultimately help us to love, to be free from those qualities which produce conflict in ourselves and with our neighbours; whether knowledge ever frees the mind of ambition.
Because ambition is, after all, one of the qualities that destroy relationship, that put man against man.
If we would live at peace with each other, surely ambition must completely come to an end-not only political, economic, social ambition, but also the more subtle and pernicious ambition, the spiritual ambition —to be something.
Is it ever possible for the mind to be free from this accumulating process of knowledge, this desire to know?
If you would find something new, experience something which is not a projection of your imagination, your mind must be free, must it not?
It must be capable of seeing something new.
Unfortunately, every time you see something new you bring in all the information known to you already, all your knowledge, all your past memories; and obviously you become incapable of looking, incapable of receiving anything that is new, that is not of the old.
Please don’t immediately translate this into detail.
If I do not know how to get back to my house, I shall be lost; if I do not know how to run a machine, I shall be of little use.
That is quite a different thing.
We are not discussing that here.
We are discussing knowledge that is used as a means to security, the psychological and inward desire to be something.
What do you get through knowledge?
The authority of knowledge, the weight of knowledge, the sense of importance, dignity, the sense of vitality and what-not?
A man who says “I know”, “There is” or “There is not” surely has stopped thinking, stopped pursuing this whole process of desire.
Our problem then, as I see it, is that we are bound, weighed down by belief, by knowledge; and is it possible for a mind to be free from yesterday and from the beliefs that have been acquired through the process of yesterday?
Do you understand the question?
Is it possible for me as an individual and you as an individual to live in this society and yet be free from the beliefs in which we have been brought up?
Is it possible for the mind to be free of all that knowledge, all that authority?
We read the various scriptures, religious books.
There they have very carefully described what to do, what not to do, how to attain the goal, what the goal is and what God is.
You all know that by heart and you have pursued that.
That is your knowledge, that is what you have acquired, that is what you have learnt; along that path you pursue.
Obviously what you pursue and seek, you will find.
But is it reality?
Is it not the projection of your own knowledge?
It is not reality.
Is it possible to realize that now—not to-morrow, but now—and say “I see the truth of it”, and let it go, so that your mind is not crippled by this process of imagination, of projection?
Is the mind capable of freedom from belief?
You can only be free from it when you understand the inward nature of the causes that make you hold on to it, not only the conscious but the unconscious motives as well, that make you believe.
After all, we are not merely a superficial entity functioning on the conscious level.
We can find out the deeper conscious and unconscious activities if we give the unconscious mind a chance, because it is much quicker in response than the conscious mind.
While your conscious mind is quietly thinking, listening and watching, the unconscious mind is much more active, much more alert and much more receptive; it can, therefore, have an answer.
Can the mind which has been subjugated, intimidated, forced, compelled to believe, can such a mind be free to think?
Can it look anew and remove the process of isolation between you and another?
Please do not say that belief brings people together.
It does not.
That is obvious.
No organized religion has ever done that.
Look at yourselves in your own country.
You are all believers, but are you all together?
Are you all united?
You yourselves know you are not.
The process is the same right through the world—whether in the east or in the west—Christians destroying Christians, murdering each other for petty little things, driving people into camps and so on, the whole horror of war.
Therefore belief does not unite people.
That is so clear.
If that is clear and that is true, and if you see it, then it must be followed.
But the difficulty is that most of us do not see, because we are not capable of facing that inward insecurity, that inward sense of being alone.
We want something to lean on, whether it is the State, whether it is the caste, whether it is nationalism, whether it is a Master or a Saviour or anything else.
And when we see the falseness of all this, the mind then is capable—it may be temporarily for a second—of seeing the truth of it; even though when it is too much for it, it goes back.
But to see temporarily is sufficient; if you can see it for a fleeting second, it is enough; because you will then see an extraordinary thing taking place.
The unconscious is at work, though the conscious may reject.
It is not a progressive second; but that second is the only thing, and it will have its own results, even in spite of the conscious mind struggling against it.
So our question is: “Is it possible for the mind to be free from knowledge and belief?
” Is not the mind made up of knowledge and belief?
Is not the structure of the mind belief and knowledge?
Belief and knowledge are the processes of recognition, the centre of the mind.
The process is enclosing, the process is conscious as well as unconscious.
Can the mind be free of its own structure?
Can the mind cease to be?
That is the problem.
Mind, as we know it, has belief behind it, has desire, the urge to be secure, knowledge, and accumulation of strength.
If, with all its power and superiority, one cannot think for oneself, there can be no peace in the world.
A man of peace, a man of earnestness, cannot isolate himself and yet talk of brotherhood and peace.
It is just a game, political or religious, a sense of achievement and ambition.
A man who is really earnest about this, who wants to discover, has to face the problem of knowledge and belief; he has to go behind it, to discover the whole process of desire at work, the desire to be secure, the desire to be certain.
A mind that would be in a state in which the new can take place—whether it be the truth, whether it be God, or what you will—must surely cease to acquire, to gather; it must put aside all knowledge.
A mind burdened with knowledge cannot possibly understand, surely, that which is real, which is not measurable.
FOR MOST OF US, our whole life is based on effort, some kind of volition.
We cannot conceive of an action without volition, without effort; our life is based on it.
Our social, economic and so-called spiritual life is a series of efforts, always culminating in a certain result.
And we think effort is essential, necessary.
Why do we make effort?
Is it not, put simply, in order to achieve a result, to become something, to reach a goal?
If we do not make an effort, we think we shall stagnate.
If we want to alter ourselves, if we want to bring about a radical change in ourselves, we make a tremendous effort to eliminate the old habits, to resist the habitual environmental influences and so on.
So we are used to this series of efforts in order to find or achieve something, in order to live at all.
Is not all such effort the activity of the self?
Is not effort self-centred activity?
If we make an effort from the centre of the self, it must inevitably produce more conflict, more confusion, more misery.
Yet we keep on making effort after effort.
Very few of us realize that the self-centred activity of effort does not clear up any of our problems.
On the contrary, it increases our confusion and our misery and our sorrow.
We know this; and yet we continue hoping somehow to break through this self-centred activity of effort, the action of the will.
I think we shall understand the significance of life, if we understand what it means to make an effort.
It is impossible, is it not?
You struggle to be happy and there is no happiness, is there?
Joy does not come through suppression, through control or indulgence.
You may indulge but there is bitterness at the end.
You may suppress or control, but there is always strife in the hidden.
Therefore happiness does not come through effort, nor joy through control and suppression; and still all our life is a series of suppressions, a series of controls, a series of regretful indulgences.
Also there is a constant overcoming, a constant struggle with our passions, our greed and our stupidity.
So do we not strive, struggle, make effort, in the hope of finding happiness, finding something which will give us a feeling of peace, a sense of love?
Yet does love or understanding come by strife?
I think it is very important to understand what we mean by struggle, strife or effort.
Does not effort mean a struggle to change what is into what is not, or into what it should be or should become?
That is we are constantly struggling to avoid facing what is, or we are trying to get away from it or to transform or modify what is.
A man who is truly content is the man who understands what is, gives the right significance to what is.
That is true contentment; it is not concerned with having few or many possessions but with the understanding of the whole significance of what is; and that can only come when you recognize what is, when you are aware of it, not when you are trying to modify it or change it.
So we see that effort is a strife or a struggle to transform that which is into something which you wish it to be.
I am only talking about psychological struggle, not the struggle with a physical problem, like engineering or some discovery or transformation which is purely technical.
I am only talking of that struggle which is psychological and which always overcomes the technical.
You may build with great care a marvellous society, using the infinite knowledge science has given us.
But so long as the psychological strife and struggle and battle are not understood and the psychologica, overtones and currents are not overcome, the structure of society, however marvellously built, is bound to crash, as has happened over and over again.
Effort is a distraction from what is.
The moment I accept what is there is no struggle.
Any form of struggle or strife is an indication of distraction; and distraction, which is effort, must exist so long as psychologically I wish to transform what is into something it is not.
First we must be free to see that joy and happiness do not come through effort.
Is creation through effort, or is there creation only with the cessation of effort?
When do you write, paint or sing?
When do you create?
Surely when there is no effort, when you are completely open, when on all levels you are in complete communication, completely integrated.
Then there is joy and then you begin to sing or write a poem or paint or fashion something.
The moment of creation is not born of struggle.
Perhaps in understanding the question of creativeness we shall be able to understand what we mean by effort.
Is creativeness the outcome of effort, and are we aware in those moments when we are creative?
Or is creativeness a sense of total self-forgetfulness, that sense when there is no turmoil, when one is wholly unaware of the movement of thought, when there is only a complete, full, rich being?
Is that state the result of travail, of struggle, of conflict, of effort?
I do not know if you have ever noticed that when you do something easily, swiftly, there is no effort, there is complete absence of struggle; but as our lives are mostly a series of battles, conflicts and struggles, we cannot imagine a life, a state of being, in which strife has fully ceased.
To understand the state of being without strife, that state of creative existence, surely one must inquire into the whole problem of effort.
We mean by effort the striving to fulfil oneself, to become something, don’t we?
I am this, and I want to become that; I am not that, and I must become that.
In becoming ‘that’, there is strife, there is battle, conflict,struggle.
In this struggle we are concerned inevitably with fulfilment through the gaining of an end; we seek self-fulfilment in an object, in a person, in an idea, and that demands constant battle, struggle, the effort to become, to fulfil.
So we have taken this effort as inevitable; and I wonder if it is inevitable—this struggle to become something?
Why is there this struggle?
Where there is the desire for fulfilment, in whatever degree and at whatever level, there must be struggle.
Fulfilment is the motive, the drive behind the effort; whether it is in the big executive, the housewife, or a poor man, there is this battle to become, to fulfil, going on.
Now why is there the desire to fulfil oneself?
Obviously, the desire to fulfil, to become something, arises when there is awareness of being nothing.
Because I am nothing, because I am insufficient, empty, inwardly poor, I struggle to become something; outwardly or inwardly I struggle to fulfil myself in a person, in a thing, in an idea.
To fill that void is the whole process of our existence.
Being aware that we are empty, inwardly poor, we struggle either to collect things outwardly, or to cultivate inward riches.
There is effort only when there is an escape from that inward void through action, through contemplation, through acquisition, through achievement, through power, and so on.
I am aware of my insufficiency, my inward poverty, and I struggle to run away from it or to fill it.
This running away, avoiding, or trying to cover up the void, entails struggle, strife, effort.
Now if one does not make an effort to run away, what happens?
One lives with that loneliness, that emptiness; and in accepting that emptiness one will find that there comes a creative state which has nothing to do with strife, with effort.
Effort exists only so long as we are trying to avoid that inward loneliness, emptiness, but when we look at it, observe it, when we accept what is without avoidance, we will find there comes a state of being in which all strife ceases.
That state of being is creativeness and it is not the result of strife.
But when there is understanding of what is, which is emptiness, inward insufficiency, when one lives with that insufficiency and understands it fully, there comes creative reality, creative intelligence, which alone brings happiness.
Therefore action as we know it is really reaction, it is a ceaseless becoming, which is the denial, the avoidance of what is; but when there is awareness of emptiness without choice, without condemnation or justification, then in that understanding of what is there is action, and this action is creative being.
You will understand this if you are aware of yourself in action.
Observe yourself as you are acting, not only outwardly but see also the movement of your thought and feeling.
When you are aware of this movement you will see that the thought process, which is also feeling and action, is based on an idea of becoming.
The idea of becoming arises only when there is a sense of insecurity, and that sense of insecurity comes when one is aware of the inward void.
If you are aware of that process of thought and feeling, you will see that there is a constant battle going on, an effort to change, to modify, to alter what is.
This is the effort to become, and becoming is a direct avoidance of what is.
Through self-knowledge, through constant awareness, you will find that strife, battle, the conflict of becoming, leads to pain, to sorrow and ignorance.
It is only if you are aware of inward insufficiency and live with it without escape, accepting it wholly, that you will discover an extraordinary tranquillity, a tranquillity which is not put together, made up, but a tranquillity which comes with understanding of what is.
Only in that state of tranquillity is there creative being.
WE SEE CONTRADICTION in us and about us; because we are in contradiction, there is lack of peace in us and therefore outside us.
There is in us a constant state of denial and assertion—what we want to be and what we are.
The state of contradiction creates conflict and this conflict does not bring about peace—which is a simple, obvious fact.
This inward contradiction should not be translated into some kind of philosophical dualism, because that is a very easy escape.
That is by saying that contradiction is a state of dualism we think we have solved it—which is obviously a mere convention, a contributory escape from actuality.
Now what do we mean by conflict, by contradiction?
Why is there a contradiction in me?
I am this, and I want to be that.
This contradiction in us is a fact, not a metaphysical dualism.
Metaphysics has no significance in understanding what is.
We may discuss, say, dualism, what it is, if it exists, and so on; but of what value is it if we don’t know that there is contradiction in us, opposing desires, opposing interests, opposing pursuits?
I want to be good and I am not able to be.
This contradiction, this opposition in us, must be understood because it creates conflict; and in conflict, in struggle, we cannot create individually.
Let us be clear on the state we are in.
There is contradiction, so there must be struggle; and struggle is destruction, waste.
In that state we can produce nothing but antagonism, strife, more bitterness and sorrow.
If we can understand this fully and hence be free of contradiction, then there can be inward peace, which will bring understanding of each other.
The problem is this.
Seeing that conflict is destructive, wasteful, why is it that in each of us there is contradiction?
To understand that, we must go a little further.
Why is there the sense of opposing desires?
I do not know if we are aware of it in ourselves—this contradiction, this sense of wanting and not wanting, remembering something and trying to forget it in order to find something new.
Just watch it.
It is very simple and very normal.
It is not something extraordinary.
The fact is, there is contradiction.
Then why does this contradiction arise?
What do we mean by contradiction?
Does it not imply an impermanent state which is being opposed by another impermanent state?
I think I have a permanent desire, I posit in myself a permanent desire and another desire arises which contradicts it; this contradiction brings about conflict, which is waste.
That is to say there is a constant denial of one desire by another desire, one pursuit overcoming another pursuit.
Now, is there such a thing as a permanent desire?
Surely, all desire is impermanent—not metaphysically, but actually.
I want a job.
That is I look to a certain job as a means of happiness; and when I get it, I am dissatisfied.
I want to become the manager, then the owner, and so on and on, not only in this world, but in the so-called spiritual world—the teacher becoming the principal, the priest becoming the bishop, the pupil becoming the master.
This constant becoming, arriving at one state after another, brings about contradiction, does it not?
Therefore, why not look at life not as one permanent desire but as a series of fleeting desires always in opposition to each other?
Hence the mind need not be in a state of contradiction.
If I regard life not as a permanent desire but as a series of temporary desires which are constantly changing, then there is no contradiction.
Contradiction arises only when the mind has a fixed point of desire; that is when the mind does not regard all desire as moving, transient, but seizes upon one desire and makes that into a permanency—only then, when other desires arise, is there contradiction.
But all desires are in constant movement, there is no fixation of desire.
There is no fixed point in desire; but the mind establishes a fixed point because it treats everything as a means to arrive, to gain; and there must be contradiction, conflict, as long as one is arriving.
You want to arrive, you want to succeed, you want to find an ultimate God or truth which will be your permanent satisfaction.
Therefore you are not seeking truth, you are not seeking God.
You are seeking lasting gratification, and that gratification you clothe with an idea, a respectable-sounding word such as God, truth; but actually we are all seeking gratification, and we place that gratification, that satisfaction, at the highest point, calling it God, and the lowest point is drink.
So long as the mind is seeking gratification, there is not much difference between God and drink.
Socially, drink may be bad; but the inward desire for gratification, for gain, is even more harmful, is it not?
If you really want to find truth, you must be extremely honest, not merely at the verbal level but altogether; you must be extraordinarily clear, and you cannot be clear if you are unwilling to face facts.
Now what brings about contradiction in each one of us?
Surely it is the desire to become something, is it not?
We all want to become something: to become successful in the world and, inwardly, to achieve a result.
So long as we think in terms of time, in terms of achievement, in terms of position, there must be contradiction.
After all, the mind is the product of time.
Thought is based on yesterday, on the past; and so long as thought is functioning within the field of time, thinking in terms of the future, of becoming, gaining, achieving, there must be contradiction, because then we are incapable of facing exactly what is.
Only in realizing, in understanding, in being choicelessly aware of what is, is there a possibility of freedom from that disintegrating factor which is contradiction.
Therefore it is essential, is it not?, to understand the whole process of our thinking, for it is there that we find contradiction.
Thought itself has become a contradiction because we have not understood the total process of ourselves; and that understanding is possible only when we are fully aware of our thought, not as an observer operating upon his thought, but integrally and without choice—which is extremely arduous.
Then only is there the dissolution of that contradiction which is so detrimental, so painful.
So long as we are trying to achieve a psychological result, so long as we want inward security, there must be a contradiction in our life.
I do not think that most of us are aware of this contradiction; or, if we are, we do not see its real significance.
On the contrary, contradiction gives us an impetus to live; the very element of friction makes us feel that we are alive.
The effort, the struggle of contradiction, gives us a sense of vitality.
That is why we love wars, that is why we enjoy the battle of frustrations.
So long as there is the desire to achieve a result, which is the desire to be psychologically secure, there must be a contradiction; and where there is contradiction, there cannot be a quiet mind.
Quietness of mind is essential to understand the whole significance of life.
Thought can never be tranquil; thought, which is the product of time, can never find that which is timeless, can never know that which is beyond time.
The very nature of our thinking is a contradiction, because we are always thinking in terms of the past or of the future; therefore we are never fully cognizant, fully aware of the present.
To be fully aware of the present is an extraordinarily difficult task because the mind is incapable of facing a fact directly without deception.
Thought is the product of the past and therefore it can only think in terms of the past or of the future; it cannot be completely aware of a fact in the present.
So long as thought, which is the product of the past, tries to eliminate contradiction and all the problems that it creates, it is merely pursuing a result, trying to achieve an end, and such thinking only creates more contradiction and hence conflict, misery and confusion in us and, therefore, about us.
To be free of contradiction, one must be aware of the present without choice.
How can there be choice when you are confronted with a fact?
Surely the understanding of the fact is made impossible so long as thought is trying to operate upon the fact in terms of becoming, changing, altering.
Therefore self-knowledge is the beginning of understanding; without self-knowledge, contradiction and conflict will continue.
To know the whole process, the totality of oneself, does not require any expert, any authority.
The pursuit of authority only breeds fear.
No expert, no specialist, can show us how to understand the process of the self.
One has to study it for oneself.
You and I can help each other by talking about it, but none can unfold it for us, no specialist, no teacher, can explore it for us.
We can be aware of it only in our relationship—in our relationship to things, to property, to people and to ideas.
In relationship we shall discover that contradiction arises when action is approximating itself to an idea.
The idea is merely the crystallization of thought as a symbol, and the effort to live up to the symbol brings about a contradiction.
Thus, so long as there is a pattern of thought, contradiction will continue; to put an end to the pattern, and so to contradiction, there must be self-knowledge.
This understanding of the self is not a process reserved for the few.
The self is to be understood in our everyday speech, in the way we think and feel, in the way we look at another.
If we can be aware of every thought, of every feeling, from moment to moment, then we shall see that in relationship the ways of the self are understood.
Then only is there a possibility of that tranquillity of mind in which alone the ultimate reality can come into being.
DO WE KNOW WHAT we mean by the self?
By that, I mean the idea, the memory, the conclusion, the experience, the various forms of nameable and unnameable intentions, the conscious endeavour to be or not to be, the accumulated memory of the unconscious, the racial, the group, the individual, the clan, and the whole of it all, whether it is projected outwardly in action or projected spiritually as virtue; the striving after all this is the self.
In it is included the competition, the desire to be.
The whole process of that is the self; and we know actually when we are faced with it that it is an evil thing.
I am using the word ‘evil’ intentionally, because the self is dividing: the self is self-enclosing: its activities, however noble, are separative and isolating.
We know all this.
We also know those extraordinary moments when the self is not there, in which there is no sense of endeavour, of effort, and which happens when there is love.
It seems to me that it is important to understand how experience strengthens the self.
If we are earnest, we should understand this problem of experience.
Now what do we mean by experience?
We have experience all the time, impressions; and we translate those impressions, and we react or act according to them; we are calculating, cunning, and so on.
There is the constant interplay between what is seen objectively and our reaction to it, and interplay between the conscious and the memories of the unconscious.
According to my memories, I react to whatever I see, to whatever I feel.
In this process of reacting to what I see, what I feel, what I know, what I believe, experience is takingplace, is it not?
Reaction, response to something seen, is experience.
When I see you, I react; the naming of that reaction is experience.
If I do not name that reaction it is not an experience.
Watch your own responses and what is taking place about you.
There is no experience unless there is a naming process going on at the same time.
If I do not recognize you, how can I have the experience of meeting you?
It sounds simple and right.
Is it not a fact?
That is if I do not react according to my memories, according to my conditioning, according to my prejudices, how can I know that I have had an experience?
Then there is the projection of various desires.
I desire to be protected, to have security inwardly; or I desire to have a Master, a guru, a teacher, a God; and I experience that which I have projected; that is I have projected a desire which has taken a form, to which I have given a name; to that I react.
It is my projection.
It is my naming.
That desire which gives me an experience makes me say: “I have experience”, “I have met the Master”, or “I have not met the Master”.
You know the whole process of naming an experience.
Desire is what you call experience, is it not?
When I desire silence of the mind, what is taking place?
What happens?
I see the importance of having a silent mind, a quiet mind, for various reasons; because the Upanishadshave said so, religious scriptures have said so, saints have said it, and also occasionally I myself feel how good it is to be quiet, because my mind is so very chatty all the day.
At times I feel how nice, how pleasurable it is to have a peaceful mind, a silent mind.
I know what this or that book says about meditation, and the various forms of discipline.
So through discipline I seek to experience silence.
The self, the ‘me’, has therefore established itself in the experience of silence.
I want to understand what is truth; that is my desire, my longing; then there follows my projection of what I consider to be the truth, because I have read lots about it; I haveheard many people talk about it; religious scriptures have described it.
I want all that.
If I did not recognize that state, I would not call it truth.
I recognize it and I experience it; and that experience gives strength to the self, to the ‘me’, does it not?
So the self becomes entrenched in the experience.
So experience is always strengthening the ‘me’.
The more you are entrenched in your experience, the more does the self get strengthened.
As a result of this, you have a certain strength of character, strength of knowledge, of belief, which you display to other people because you know they are not as clever as you are, and because you have the gift of the pen or of speech and you are cunning.
Because the self is still acting, so your beliefs, your Masters, your castes, your economic system are all a process of isolation, and they therefore bring contention.
You must, if you are at all serious or earnest in this, dissolve this centre completely and not justify it.
That is why we must understand the process of experience.
Is it possible for the mind, for the self, not to project, not to desire, not to experience?
We see that all experiences of the self are a negation, a destruction, and yet we call them positive action, don’t we?
That is what we call the positive way of life.
To undo this whole process is, to you, negation.
Are you right in that?
Can we, you and I, as individuals, go to the root of it and understand the process of the self?
Now what brings about dissolution of the self?
Religious and other groups have offered identification, have they not?
“Identify yourself with a larger, and the self disappears”, is what they say.
But surely identification is still the process of the self; the larger is simply the projection of the ‘me’, which I experience and which therefore strengthens the ‘me’.
All the various forms of discipline, belief and knowledge surely only strengthen the self.
Can we find an element which will dissolve the self?
Or is that a wrong question?
That is what we want basically.
We want to find something which will dissolve the ‘me’, do we not?
So can I see the ‘me’ wherever it functions, and see its destructive forces and energy?
Whatever name I may give to it, it is an isolating force, it is a destructive force, and I want to find a way of dissolving it.
You must have asked this yourself—“I see the ‘I’ functioning all the time and always bringing anxiety, fear, frustration, despair, misery, not only to myself but to all around me.
Can we go to the root of it and destroy it?
That is the only way of truly functioning, is it not?
Most of us are intelligent in layers, you probably in one way and I in some other way.
Some of you are intelligent in your business work, some others in your office work, and so on; people are intelligent in different ways; but we are not integrally intelligent.
To be integrally intelligent means to be without the self.
Is it possible?
Is it possible for the self to be completely absent now?
You know it is possible.
What are the necessary ingredients, requirements?
What is the element that brings it about?
Can I find it?
When I put that question “Can I find it?
” surely I am convinced that it is possible; so I have already created an experience in which the self is going to be strengthened, is it not?
Understanding of the self requires a great deal of intelligence, a great deal of watchfulness, alertness, watching ceaselessly, so that it does not slip away.
I, who am very earnest, want to dissolve the self.
When I say that, I know it is possible to dissolve the self.
The moment I say “I want to dissolve this”, in that there is still the experiencing of the self; and so the self is strengthened.
So how is it possible for the self not to experience?
One can see that the state of creation is not at all the experience of the self.
Creation is when the self is not there, because creation is not intellectual, is not of the mind, is not self-projected, is something beyond all experiencing.
So is it possible for the mind to be quite still, in a state of non-recognition, or non-experiencing, to be in a state in which creation can take place, which means when the self is not there, when the self is absent?
The problem is this, is it not?
Any movement of the mind, positive or negative, is an experience which actually strengthens the ‘me’.
Is it possible for the mind not to recognize?
That can only take place when there is complete silence, but not the silence which is an experience of the self and which therefore strengthens the self.
Is there a spiritual entity which supersedes the self and destroys it, which puts it aside?
We think there is, don’t we?
Most religious people think there is such an element.
The materialist says, “It is impossible for the self to be destroyed; it can only be conditioned and restrained—politically, economically and socially; we can hold it firmly within a certain pattern and we can break it; and therefore it can be made to lead a high life, a moral life, and not to interfere with anything but to follow the social pattern, and to function merely as a machine”.
That we know.
There are other people, the so-called religious ones —they are not really religious, though we call them so—who say, “Fundamentally, there is such an element.
If we can get into touch with it, it will dissolve the self”.
Is there such an element to dissolve the self?
Please see what we are doing.
We are forcing the self into a corner.
If you allow yourself to be forced into the corner, you will see what will happen.
We should like there to be an element which is timeless, which is not of the self, which, we hope, will come and intercede and destroy the self—and which we call God.
Now is there such a thing which the mind can conceive?
There may be or there may not be; that is not the point.
But when the mind seeks a timeless spiritual state which will go into action in order to destroy the self, is that not another form of experience which is strengthening the ‘me’?
When you believe, is that not what is actually taking place?
When you believe that there is truth, God, the timeless state, immortality, is that not the process of strengthening the self?
The self has projected that thing which you feel and believe will come and destroy the self.
So, having projected this idea of continuance in a timeless state as a spiritual entity, you have an experience; and such experience only strengthens the self; and therefore what have you done?
You have not really destroyed the self but only given it a different name, a different quality; the self is still there, because you have experienced it.
Thus our action from the beginning to the end is the same action, only we think it is evolving, growing, becoming more and more beautiful; but, if you observe inwardly, it is the same action going on, the same ‘me’ functioning at different levels with different labels, different names.
When you see the whole process, the cunning, extraordinary inventions, the intelligence of the self, how it covers itself up through identification, through virtue, through experience, through belief, through knowledge; when you see that the mind is moving in a circle, in a cage of its own making, what happens?
When you are aware of it, fully cognizant of it, then are you not extraordinarily quiet—not through compulsion, not through any reward, not through any fear?
When you recognize that every movement of the mind is merely a form of strengthening the self, when you observe it, see it, when you are completely aware of it in action, when you come to that point—not ideologically, verbally, not through projected experiencing, but when you are actually in that state—then you will see that the mind, being utterly still, has no power of creating.
Whatever the mind creates is in a circle, within the field of the self.
When the mind is non-creating there is creation, which is not a recognizable process.
Reality, truth, is not to be recognized.
For truth to come, belief, knowledge, experiencing, the pursuit of virtue—all this must go.
The virtuous person who is conscious of pursuing virtue can never find reality.
He may be a very decent person; but that is entirely different from being a man of truth, a man who understands.
To the man of truth, truth has come into being.
A virtuous man is a righteous man, and a righteous man can never understand what is truth because virtue to him is the covering of the self, the strengthening of the self, because he is pursuing virtue.
When he says “I must be without greed”, the state of non-greed which he experiences only strengthens the self.
That is why it is so important to be poor, not only in the things of the world but also in belief and in knowledge.
A man with worldly riches or a man rich in knowledge and belief will never know anything but darkness, and will be the centre of all mischief and misery.
But if you and I, as individuals, can see this whole working of the self, then we shall know what love is.
I assure you that is the only reformation which can possibly change the world.
Love is not of the self.
Self cannot recognize love.
You say “I love”; but then, in the very saying of it, in the very experiencing of it, love is not.
But, when you know love, self is not.
When there is love, self is not.
Fear can exist only in relation to something, not in isolation.
How can I be afraid of death, how can I be afraid of something I do not know?
I can be afraid only of what I know.
When I say I am afraid of death, am I really afraid of the unknown, which is death, or am I afraid of losing what I have known?
My fear is not of death but of losing my association with things belonging to me.
My fear is always in relation to the known, not to the unknown.
My inquiry now is how to be free from the fear of the known, which is the fear of losing my family, my reputation, my character, my bank account, my appetites and so on.
You may say that fear arises from conscience; but your conscience is formed by your conditioning, so conscience is still the result of the known.
What do I know?
Knowledge is having ideas, having opinions about things, having a sense of continuity as in relation to the known, and no more.
Ideas are memories, the result of experience, which is response to challenge.
I am afraid of the known, which means I am afraid of losing people, things or ideas, I am afraid of discovering what I am, afraid of being at a loss, afraid of the pain which might come into being when I have lost or have not gained or have no more pleasure.
There is fear of pain.
Physical pain is a nervous response, but psychological pain arises when I hold on to things that give me satisfaction, for then I am afraid of anyone or anything that may take them away from me.
The psychological accumulations prevent psychological pain as long as they are undisturbed; that is I am a bundle of accumulations,experiences, which prevent any serious form of disturbance—and I do not want to be disturbed.
Therefore I am afraid of anyone who disturbs them.
Thus my fear is of the known, I am afraid of the accumulations, physical or psychological, that I have gathered as a means of warding off pain or preventing sorrow.
But sorrow is in the very process of accumulating to ward off psychological pain.
Knowledge also helps to prevent pain.
As medical knowledge helps to prevent physical pain, so beliefs help to prevent psychological pain, and that is why I am afraid of losing my beliefs, though I have no perfect knowledge or concrete proof of the reality of such beliefs.
I may reject some of the traditional beliefs that have been foisted on me because my own experience gives me strength, confidence, understanding; but such beliefs and the knowledge which I have acquired are basically the same—a means of warding off pain.
Fear exists so long as there is accumulation of the known, which creates the fear of losing.
Therefore fear of the unknown is really fear of losing the accumulated known.
Though my intention in accumulating is to ward off pain, pain is inherent in the process of accumulation.
The very things which I have create fear, which is pain.
The seed of defence brings offence.
I want physical security; thus I create a sovereign government, which necessitates armed forces, which means war, which destroys security.
Wherever there is a desire for self-protection, there is fear.
When I see the fallacy of demanding security I do not accumulate any more.
If you say that you see it but you cannot help accumulating, it is because you do not really see that, inherently, in accumulation there is pain.
My son dies, and I believe in reincarnation to prevent me psychologically from having more pain; but, in the very process of believing, there is doubt.
Outwardly I accumulate things, and bring war; inwardly I accumulate beliefs, and bring pain.
So long as I want to be secure, to have bank accounts, pleasures and so on, so long as I want to become something, physiologically or psychologically, there must be pain.
The very things I am doing to ward off pain bring me fear, pain.
My difficulty is my desire to live in a certain frame.
Can I not break the frame?
I can do so only when I see the truth: that the frame is causing fear and that this fear is strengthening the frame.
If I say I must break the frame because I want to be free of fear, then I am merely following another pattern which will cause further fear.
This means that I must not act, I must make no movement to break the frame.
What happens to me when I am simply looking at the frame without doing anything about it?
I see that the mind itself is the frame, the pattern; it lives in the habitual pattern which it has created for itself.
Therefore, the mind itself is fear.
Whatever the mind does goes towards strengthening an old pattern or furthering a new one.
This means that whatever the mind does to get rid of fear causes fear.
Fear finds various escapes.
The common variety is identification, is it not?
—identification with the country, with the society, with an idea.
Haven’t you noticed how you respond when you see a procession, a military procession or a religious procession, or when the country is in danger of being invaded?
You then identify yourself with the country, with a being, with an ideology.
Identification is a process of self-forgetfulness.
So long as I am conscious of the ‘me’ I know there is pain, there is struggle, there is constant fear.
But if I can identify myself with something greater, with something worth while, with beauty, with life, with truth, with belief, with knowledge, at least temporarily, there is an escape from the ‘me’, is there not?
If I talk about “my country” I forget myself temporarily, do I not?
If I can say something about God, I forget myself.
Identification therefore is a form of escape from the self, even as virtue is a form of escape from the self.
The man who pursues virtue is escaping from the self and he has a narrow mind.
That is not a virtuous mind, for virtue is something which cannot be pursued.
The more you try to become virtuous, the more strength you give to the self, to the ‘me’.
Fear, which is common to most of us in different forms, must always find a substitute and must therefore increase our struggle.
The more you are identified with a substitute, the greater the strength to hold on to that for which you are prepared to struggle, to die, because fear is at the back.
Do we now know what fear is?
Is it not the non-acceptance of what is?
We must understand the word ‘acceptance’.
I am not using that word as meaning the effort made to accept.
There is no question of accepting when I perceive what is.
When I do not see clearly what is, then I bring in the process of acceptance.
Therefore fear is the non-acceptance of what is.
How can I, who am a bundle of all these reactions, responses, memories, hopes, depressions, frustrations, who am the result of the movement of consciousness blocked, go beyond?
Can the mind, without this blocking and hindrance, be conscious?
We know, when there is no hindrance, what extraordinary joy there is.
Don’t you know when the body is perfectly healthy there is a certain joy, well-being; and don’t you know when the mind is completely free, without any block, when the centre of recognition as the ‘me’ is not there, you experience a certain joy?
Haven’t you experienced this state when the self is absent?
Surely we all have.
There is understanding and freedom from the self only when I can look at it completely and integrally as a whole; and I can do that only when I understand the whole process of all activity born of desire which is the very expression of thought—for thought is not different from desire—without justifying it, without condemning it, without suppressing it; if I can understand that, then I shall know if there is the possibility of going beyond the restrictions of the self.
I WOULD LIKE TO discuss what is simplicity, and perhaps from that arrive at the discovery of sensitivity.
We seem to think that simplicity is merely an outward expression, a withdrawal: having few possessions, wearing a loin-cloth, having no home, putting on few clothes, having a small bank account.
Surely that is not simplicity.
That is merely an outward show.
It seems to me that simplicity is essential; but simplicity can come into being only when we begin to understand the significance of self-knowledge.
Simplicity is not merely adjustment to a pattern.
Unfortunately most of us begin by being simple externally, in outward things.
It is comparatively easy to have few things and to be satisfied with few things; to be content with little and perhaps to share that little with others.
But a mere outward expression of simplicity in things, in possessions, surely does not imply the simplicity of inward being.
Because, as the world is at present, more and more things are being urged upon us, outwardly, externally.
Life is becoming more and more complex.
In order to escape from that, we try to renounce or be detached from things—from cars, from houses, from organizations, from cinemas, and from the innumerable circumstances outwardly thrust upon us.
We think we shall be simple by withdrawing.
Simplicity which is fundamental, real, can only come into being inwardly; and from that there is an outward expression.
How to be simple, then, is the problem; because that simplicity makes one more and more sensitive.
A sensitive mind, a sensitive heart, is essential, for then it is capable of quick perception, quick reception.
One can be inwardly simple, surely, only by understanding the innumerable impediments, attachments, fears, in which one is held.
But most of us like to be held—by people, by possessions, by ideas.
We like to be prisoners.
Inwardly we are prisoners, though outwardly we seem to be very simple.
Inwardly we are prisoners to our desires, to our wants, to our ideals, to innumerable motivations.
Simplicity cannot be found unless one is free inwardly.
Therefore it must begin inwardly, not outwardly.
There is an extraordinary freedom when one understands the whole process of belief, why the mind is attached to a belief.
When there is freedom from beliefs, there is simplicity.
But that simplicity requires intelligence, and to be intelligent one must be aware of one’s own impediments.
After all, what one is inwardly does affect the outer.
Society, or any form of action, is the projection of ourselves, and without transforming inwardly mere legislation has very little significance outwardly; it may bring about certain reforms, certain adjustments, but what one is inwardly always overcomes the outer.
If one is inwardly greedy, ambitious, pursuing certain ideals, that inward complexity does eventually upset, overthrow outward society, however carefully planned it may be.
Therefore one must begin within—not exclusively, not rejecting the outer.
You come to the inner, surely, by understanding the outer, by finding out how the conflict, the struggle, the pain, exists outwardly; as one investigates it more and more, naturally one comes into the psychological states which produce the outward conflicts and miseries.
The outward expression is only an indication of our inward state, but to understand the inward state one must approach through the outer.
Most of us do that.
In understanding the inner—not exclusively, not by rejecting the outer, but by understanding the outer and so coming upon the inner —we will find that, as we proceed to investigate the inward complexities of our being, we become more and more sensitive, free.
It is this inward simplicity that is so essential, because that simplicity creates sensitivity.
A mind that is not sensitive, not alert, not aware, is incapable of any receptivity, any creative action.
Conformity as a means of making ourselves simple really makes the mind and heart dull, insensitive.
Any form of authoritarian compulsion, imposed by the government, by oneself, by the ideal of achievement, and so on—any form of conformity must make for insensitivity, for not being simple inwardly.
Outwardly you may conform and give the appearance of simplicity, as so many religious people do.
Compulsion of any kind can never lead to simplicity.
On the contrary, the more you suppress, the more you substitute, the more you sublimate, the less there is simplicity, but the more you understand the process of sublimation, suppression, substitution, the greater the possibility of being simple.
Our problems—social, environmental, political, religious —are so complex that we can solve them only by being simple, not by becoming extraordinarily erudite and clever.
A simple person sees much more directly, has a more direct experience, than the complex person.
Our minds are so crowded with an infinite knowledge of facts, of what others have said, that we have become incapable of being simple and having direct experience ourselves.
These problems demand a new approach; and they can be so approached only when we are simple, inwardly really simple.
That simplicity comes only through self-knowledge, through understanding ourselves; the ways of our thinking and feeling; the movements of our thoughts; our responses; how we conform, through fear, to public opinion, to what others say, what the Buddha, the Christ, the great saints have said—all of which indicates our nature to conform, to be safe, to be secure.
When one is seeking security, one is obviously in a state of fear and therefore there is no simplicity.
Without being simple, one cannot be sensitive—to the trees, to the birds, to the mountains, to the wind, to all the things which are going on about us in the world; if one is not simple one cannot be sensitive to the inward intimation of things.
Most of us live so superficially, on the upper level of our consciousness; there we try to be thoughtful or intelligent, which is synonymous with being religious; there we try to make our minds simple, through compulsion, through discipline.
But that is not simplicity.
When we force the upper mind to be simple, such compulsion only hardens the mind, does not make the mind supple, clear, quick.
To be simple in the whole, total process of our consciousness is extremely arduous; because there must be no inward reservation, there must be an eagerness to find out, to inquire into the process of our being, which means to be awake to every intimation, to every hint; to be aware of our fears, of our hopes, and to investigate and to be free of them more and more and more.
Only then, when the mind and the heart are really simple, not encrusted, are we able to solve the many problems that confront us.
Knowledge is not going to solve our problems.
You may know, for example, that there is reincarnation, that there is a continuity after death.
You may know, I don’t say you do; or you may be convinced of it.
But that does not solve the problem.
Death cannot be shelved by your theory, or by information, or by conviction.
It is much more mysterious, much deeper, much more creative than that.
One must have the capacity to investigate all these things anew; because it is only through direct experience that our problems are solved, and to have direct experience there must be simplicity, which means there must be sensitivity.
A mind is made dull by the weight of knowledge.
A mind is made dull by the past, by the future.
Only a mind that is capable of adjusting itself to the present, continually, from moment to moment, can meet the powerful influences and pressures constantly put upon us by our environment.
Thus a religious man is not really one who puts on a robe or a loin-cloth, or lives on one meal a day, or has taken innumerable vows to be this and not to be that, but is he who is inwardly simple, who is not becoming anything.
Such a mind is capable of extraordinary receptivity, because there is no barrier, there is no fear, there is no going towards something; therefore it is capable of receiving grace, God, truth, or what you will.
But a mind that is pursuing reality is not a simple mind.
A mind that is seeking out, searching, groping, agitated, is not a simple mind.
A mind that conforms to any pattern of authority, inward or outward, cannot be sensitive.
And it is only when a mind is really sensitive, alert, aware of all its own happenings, responses, thoughts, when it is no longer becoming, is no longer shaping itself to be something—only then is it capable of receiving that which is truth.
It is only then that there can be happiness, for happiness is not an end—it is the result of reality.
When the mind and the heart have become simple and therefore sensitive—not through any form of compulsion, direction, or imposition—then we shall see that our problems can be tackled very simply.
However complex our problems, we shall be able to approach them freshly and see them differently.
That is what is wanted at the present time: people who are capable of meeting this outward confusion, turmoil, antagonism anew, creatively, simply—not with theories nor formulas, either of the left or of the right.
You cannot meet it anew if you are not simple.
A problem can be solved only when we approach it thus.
We cannot approach it anew if we are thinking in terms of certain patterns of thought, religious, political or otherwise.
So we must be free of all these things, to be simple.
That is why it is so important to be aware, to have the capacity to understand the process of our own thinking, to be cognizant of ourselves totally; from that there comes a simplicity, there comes a humility which is not a virtue or a practice.
Humility that is gained ceases to be humility.
A mind that makes itself humble is no longer a humble mind.
It is only when one has humility, not a cultivated humility, that one is able to meet the things of life that are so pressing, because then one is not important, one doesn’t look through one’s own pressures and sense of importance; one looks at the problem for itself and then one is able to solve it.
TO KNOW OURSELVES means to know our relationship with the world—not only with the world of ideas and people, but also with nature, with the things we possess.
That is our life—life being relationship to the whole.
Does the understanding of that relationship demand specialization?
Obviously not.
What it demands is awareness to meet life as a whole.
How is one to be aware?
How is one to have that awareness—if I may use this word without making it mean specialization?
How is one to be capable of meeting life as a whole?
—which means not only personal relationship with your neighbour but also with nature, with the things that you possess, with ideas, and with the things that the mind manufactures as illusion, desire and so on.
How is one to be aware of this whole process of relationship?
Surely that is our life, is it not?
There is no life without relationship; and to understand this relationship does not mean isolation.
On the contrary, it demands a full recognition or awareness of the total process of relationship.
How are we aware of anything?
How are you aware of your relationship with a person?
How are you aware of the trees, the call of a bird?
How are you aware of your reactions when you read a newspaper?
Are we aware of the superficial responses of the mind, as well as the inner responses?
First we are aware, are we not?
, of a response to a stimulus, which is an obvious fact; I see the trees, and there is a response, then sensation, contact, identification and desire.
That is the ordinary process, isn’t it?
We can observe what actually takes place, without studying any books.
So through identification you have pleasure and pain.
And our ‘capacity’ is this concern with pleasure and the avoidance of pain, is it not?
If you are interested in something, if it gives you pleasure, there is ‘capacity’ immediately; there is an awareness of that fact immediately; and if it is painful the ‘capacity’ is developed to avoid it.
So long as we are looking to ‘capacity’ to understand ourselves, I think we shall fail; because the understanding of ourselves does not depend on capacity.
It is not a technique that you develop, cultivate and increase through time, through constantly sharpening.
This awareness of oneself can be tested, surely, in the action of relationship; it can be tested in the way we talk, the way we behave.
Watch yourself without any identification, without any comparison, without any condemnation; just watch, and you will see an extraordinary thing taking place.
You not only put an end to an activity which is unconscious—because most of our activities are unconscious—you not only bring that to an end, but, further, you are aware of the motives of that action, without inquiry, without digging into it.
When you are aware, you see the whole process of your thinking and action; but it can happen only when there is no condemnation.
When I condemn something, I do not understand it, and it is one way of avoiding any kind of understanding.
I think most of us do that purposely; we condemn immediately and we think we have understood.
If we do not condemn but regard it, are aware of it, then the content, the significance of that action begins to open up.
Experiment with this and you will see for yourself.
Just be aware—without any sense of justification—which may appear rather negative but is not negative.
On the contrary, it has the quality of passivity which is direct action; and you will discover this, if you experiment with it.
After all, if you want to understand something, you have to be in a passive mood, do you not?
You cannot keep on thinking about it, speculating about it or questioning it.
You have to be sensitive enough to receive the content of it.
It is like being a sensitive photographic plate.
If I want to understand you, I have to be passively aware; then you begin to tell me all your story.
Surely that is not a question of capacity or specialization.
In that process we begin to understand ourselves—not only the superficial layers of our consciousness, but the deeper, which is much more important; because there are all our motives or intentions, our hidden, confused demands, anxieties, fears, appetites.
Outwardly we may have them all under control but inwardly they are boiling.
Until those have been completely understood through awareness, obviously there cannot be freedom, there cannot be happiness, there is no intelligence.
Is intelligence a matter of specialization?
—intelligence being the total awareness of our process.
And is that intelligence to be cultivated through any form of specialization?
Because that is what is happening, is it not?
The priest, the doctor, the engineer, the industrialist, the business man, the professor—we have the mentality of all that specialization.
To realize the highest form of intelligence—which is truth, which is God, which cannot be described—to realize that, we think we have to make ourselves specialists.
We study, we grope, we search out; and, with the mentality of the specialist or looking to the specialist, we study ourselves in order to develop a capacity which will help to unravel our conflicts, our miseries.
Our problem is, if we are at all aware, whether the conflicts and the miseries and the sorrows of our daily existence can be solved by another; and if they cannot, how is it possible for us to tackle them?
To understand a problem obviously requires a certain intelligence, and that intelligence cannot be derived from or cultivated through specialization.
It comes into being only when we are passively aware of the whole process of our consciousness, which is to be aware of ourselves without choice, without choosing what is right and what is wrong.
When you are passively aware, you will see that out of that passivity—which is not idleness, which is not sleep, but extreme alertness—the problem has quite a different significance; which means there is no longer identification with the problem and therefore there is no judgement and hence the problem begins to reveal its content.
If you are able to do that constantly, continuously, then every problem can be solved fundamentally, not superficially.
That is the difficulty, because most of us are incapable of being passively aware, letting the problem tell the story without our interpreting it.
We do not know how to look at a problem dispassionately.
We are not capable of it, unfortunately, because we want a result from the problem, we want an answer, we are looking to an end; or we try to translate the problem according to our pleasure or pain; or we have an answer already on how to deal with the problem.
Therefore we approach a problem, which is always new, with the old pattern.
The challenge is always the new, but our response is always the old; and our difficulty is to meet the challenge adequately, that is fully.
The problem is always a problem of relationship—with things, with people or with ideas; there is no other problem; and to meet the problem of relationship, with its constantly varying demands—to meet it rightly, to meet it adequately—one has to be aware passively.
This passivity is not a question of determination, of will, of discipline; to be aware that we are not passive is the beginning.
What is important, surely, is to be aware without choice, because choice brings about conflict.
The chooser is in confusion, therefore he chooses; if he is not in confusion, there is no choice.
Only the person who is confused chooses what he shall do or shall not do.
The man who is clear and simple does not choose; what is, is.
Action based on an idea is obviously the action of choice and such action is not liberating; on the contrary, it only creates further resistance, further conflict, according to that conditioned thinking.
The important thing, therefore, is to be aware from moment to moment without accumulating the experience which awareness brings; because, the moment you accumulate, you are aware only according to that accumulation, according to that pattern, according to that experience.
That is your awareness is conditioned by your accumulation and therefore there is no longer observation but merely translation.
Where there is translation, there is choice, and choice creates conflict; in conflict there can be no understanding.
Life is a matter of relationship; and to understand that relationship, which is not static, there must be an awareness which is pliable, an awareness which is alertly passive, not aggressively active.
As I said, this passive awareness does not come through any form of discipline, through any practice.
It is to be just aware, from moment to moment, of our thinking and feeling, not only when we are awake; for we shall see, as we go into it more deeply, that we begin to dream, that we begin to throw up all kinds of symbols which we translate as dreams.
Thus we open the door into the hidden, which becomes the known; but to find the unknown, we must go beyond the door—surely, that is our difficulty.
Reality is not a thing which is knowable by the mind, because the mind is the result of the known, of the past; therefore the mind must understand itself and its functioning, its truth, and only then is it possible for the unknown to be.
FOR MOST OF US, desire is quite a problem: the desire for property, for position, for power, for comfort, for immortality, for continuity, the desire to be loved, to have something permanent, satisfying, lasting, something which is beyond time.
Now, what is desire?
What is this thing that is urging, compelling us?
I am not suggesting that we should be satisfied with what we have or with what we are, which is merely the opposite of what we want.
This is generally what we mean by ‘change’, is it not?
We are everlastingly moving from one object of desire to another which we consider to be higher, nobler, more refined; but, however refined, desire is still desire, and in this movement of desire there is endless struggle, the conflict of the opposites.
Is it not, therefore, important to find out what is desire and whether it can be transformed?
What is desire?
Is it not the symbol and its sensation?
Desire is sensation with the object of its attainment.
Is there desire without a symbol and its sensation?
The symbol may be a picture, a person, a word, a name, an image, an idea which gives me a sensation, which makes me feel that I like or dislike it; if the sensation is pleasurable, I want to attain, to possess, to hold on to its symbol and continue in that pleasure.
From time to time, according to my inclinations and intensities, I change the picture, the image, the object.
With one form of pleasure I am fed up, tired, bored, so I seek a new sensation, a new idea, a new symbol.
I reject the old sensation and take on a new one, with new words, new significances, new experiences.
I resist the old and yield to the new which I consider to be higher, nobler, more satisfying.
If I observe the whole process of desire in myself I see that there is always an object towards which my mind is directed for further sensation, and that in this process there is involved resistance, temptation and discipline.
There is perception, sensation, contact and desire, and the mind becomes the mechanical instrument of this process, in which symbols, words, objects are the centre round which all desire, all pursuits, all ambitions are built; that centre is the ‘me’.
The more I am frustrated, the more strength I give to the ‘me’.
So long as there is hoping, longing, there is always the background of fear, which again strengthens that centre.
And revolution is possible only at that centre, not on the surface, which is merely a process of distraction, a superficial change leading to mischievous action.
When I am aware of this whole structure of desire, I see how my mind has become a dead centre, a mechanical process of memory.
Having tired of one desire, I automatically want to fulfil myself in another.
My mind is always experiencing in terms of sensation, it is the instrument of sensation.
I have had enough of this world and its travail and I want peace, the peace that is everlasting; so I meditate, control, I shape my mind in order to experience that peace.
The experiencing of that peace is still sensation.
So my mind is the mechanical instrument of sensation, of memory, a dead centre from which I act, think.
The objects I pursue are the projections of the mind as symbols from which it derives sensations.
The word ‘God’, the word ‘love’, the word ‘communism’, the word ‘democracy’, the word ‘nationalism’—these are all symbols which give sensations to the mind, and therefore the mind clings to them.
As you and I know, every sensation comes to an end, and so we proceed from one sensation to another; and every sensation strengthens the habit of seeking further sensation.
Thus the mind becomes merely an instrument of sensation and memory, and in that process we are caught.
So long as the mind is seeking further experience it can only think in terms of sensation; and any experience that may be spontaneous, creative, vital, strikingly new, it immediately reduces to sensation and pursues that sensation, which then becomes a memory.
Therefore the experience is dead and the mind becomes merely a stagnant pool of the past.
If we have gone into it at all deeply we are familiar with this process; and we seem to be incapable of going beyond.
Hence there is never a creative state.
In myself I see this process of desire going on, which is mechanical, repetitive, which holds the mind in a process of routine and makes of it a dead centre of the past in which there is no creative spontaneity.
Also there are sudden moments of creation, of that which is not of the mind, which is not of memory, which is not of sensation or of desire.
Our problem, therefore, is to understand desire—not how far it should go or where it should come to an end, but to understand the whole process of desire, the cravings, the longings, the burning appetites.
Why begin at the superficial level of giving up outward possessions when your mind is crippled with innumerable wants, innumerable desires, beliefs, struggles?
Surely it is there that the revolution must take place, not in how much you possess or what clothes you wear or how many meals you eat.
But we are impressed by these things because our minds are very superficial.
Your problem and my problem is to see whether the mind can ever be free from desire, from sensation.
Surely creation has nothing to do with sensation; reality, God, or what you will, is not a state which can be experienced as sensation.
When you have an experience, what happens?
It has given you a certain sensation, a feeling of elation or depression.
Naturally, you try to avoid, put aside, the state of depression; but if it is a joy, a feeling of elation, you pursue it.
Your experience has produced a pleasurable sensation and you want more of it; and the ‘more’ strengthens the dead centre of the mind, which is ever craving further experience.
Hence the mind cannot experience anything new, it is incapable of experiencing anything new, because its approach is always through memory, through recognition; and that which is recognized through memory is not truth, creation, reality.
Such a mind cannot experience reality; it can only experience sensation, and creation is not sensation, it is something that is everlastingly new from moment to moment.
Now I realize the state of my own mind; I see that it is the instrument of sensation and desire, or rather that it is sensation and desire, and that it is mechanically caught up in routine.
Such a mind is incapable of ever receiving or feeling out the new; for the new must obviously be something beyond sensation, which is always the old.
So, this mechanical process with its sensations has to come to an end, has it not?
The wanting more, the pursuit of symbols, words, images, with their sensation—all that has to come to an end.
Only then is it possible for the mind to be in that state of creativeness in which the new can always come into being.
If you will understand without being mesmerized by words, by habits, by ideas, and see how important it is to have the new constantly impinging on the mind, then, perhaps, you will understand the process of desire, the routine, the boredom, the constant craving for experience.
Then I think you will begin to see that desire has very little significance in life for a man who is really seeking.
Obviously there are certain physical needs: food, clothing, shelter, and all the rest of it.
But they never become psychological appetites, things on which the mind builds itself as a centre of desire.
Beyond the physical needs, any form of desire—for greatness, for truth, for virtue—becomes a psychological process by which the mind builds the idea of the ‘me’ and strengthens itself at the centre.
When you see this process, when you are really aware of it without opposition, without a sense of temptation, without resistance, without justifying or judging it, then you will discover that the mind is capable of receiving the new and that the new is never a sensation; therefore it can never be recognized, re-experienced.
It is a state of being in which creativeness comes without invitation, without memory; and that is reality.
LIFE IS EXPERIENCE, experience in relationship.
One cannot live in isolation; so life is relationship and relationship is action.
And how can one have that capacity for understanding relationship which is life?
Does not relationship mean not only communion with people but intimacy with things and ideas?
Life is relationship, which is expressed through contact with things, with people and with ideas.
In understanding relationship we shall have capacity to meet life fully, adequately.
So our problem is not capacity—for capacity is not independent of relationship—but rather the understanding of relationship, which will naturally produce the capacity for quick pliability, for quick adjustment, for quick response.
Relationship, surely, is the mirror in which you discover yourself.
Without relationship you are not; to be is to be related; to be related is existence.
You exist only in relationship; otherwise you do not exist, existence has no meaning.
It is not because you think you are that you come into existence.
You exist because you are related; and it is the lack of understanding of relationship that causes conflict.
Now there is no understanding of relationship, because we use relationship merely as a means of furthering achievement, furthering transformation, furthering becoming.
But relationship is a means of self-discovery, because relationship is to be; it is existence.
Without relationship, I am not.
To understand myself, I must understand relationship.
Relationship is a mirror in which I can see myself.
That mirror can either be distorted, or it can be ‘as is’, reflecting that which is.
But most of us see in relationship, in that mirror,things we would rather see; we do not see what is.
We would rather idealize, escape, we would rather live in the future than understand that relationship in the immediate present.
Now if we examine our life, our relationship with another, we shall see that it is a process of isolation.
We are really not concerned with another; though we talk a great deal about it, actually we are not concerned.
We are related to someone only so long as that relationship gratifies us, so long as it gives us a refuge, so long as it satisfies us.
But the moment there is a disturbance in the relationship which produces discomfort in ourselves, we discard that relationship.
In other words, there is relationship only so long as we are gratified.
This may sound harsh, but if you really examine your life very closely you will see it is a fact; and to avoid a fact is to five in ignorance, which can never produce right relationship.
If we look into our fives and observe relationship, we see it is a process of building resistance against another, a wall over which we look and observe the other; but we always retain the wall and remain behind it, whether it be a psychological wall, a material wall, an economic wall or a national wall.
So long as we live in isolation, behind a wall, there is no relationship with another; and we live enclosed because it is much more gratifying, we think it is much more secure.
The world is so disruptive, there is so much sorrow, so much pain, war, destruction, misery, that we want to escape and live within the walls of security of our own psychological being.
So, relationship with most of us is actually a process of isolation, and obviously such relationship builds a society which is also isolating.
That is exactly what is happening throughout the world: you remain in your isolation and stretch your hand over the wall, calling it nationalism, brotherhood or what you will, but actually sovereign governments, armies, continue.
Still clinging to your own limitations, you think you can create world unity, world peace—which is impossible.
So long as you have a frontier, whether national, economic, religious or social, it is an obvious fact that there cannot be peace in the world.
The process of isolation is a process of the search for power; whether one is seeking power individually or for a racial or national group there must be isolation, because the very desire for power, for position, is separatism.
After all, that is what each one wants, is it not?
He wants a powerful position in which he can dominate, whether at home, in the office, or in a bureaucratic régime.
Each one is seeking power, and in seeking power he will establish a society which is based on power, military, industrial, economic, and so on—which again is obvious.
Is not the desire for power in its very nature isolating?
A man who is affectionate, who is kindly, has no sense of power, and therefore such a man is not bound to any nationality, to any flag.
He has no flag.
There is no such thing as living in isolation—no country, no people, no individual, can live in isolation; yet, because you are seeking power in so many different ways, you breed isolation.
The nationalist is a curse because through his very nationalistic, patriotic spirit, he is creating a wall of isolation.
He is so identified with his country that he builds a wall against another.
What happens when you build a wall against something?
That something is constantly beating against your wall.
When you resist something, the very resistance indicates that you are in conflict with the other.
So nationalism, which is a process of isolation, which is the outcome of the search for power, cannot bring about peace in the world.
The man who is a nationalist and talks of brotherhood is telling a lie; he is living in a state of contradiction.
Can one live in the world without the desire for power, for position, for authority?
Obviously one can.
One does it when one does not identify oneself with something greater.
Because you in yourself are empty, dull, weak, you like to identify yourself with something greater.
That desire to identify yourself with something greater is the desire for power.
Relationship is a process of self-revelation, and, without knowing oneself, the ways of one’s own mind and heart, merely to establish an outward order, a system, a cunning formula, has very little meaning.
What is important is to understand oneself in relationship with another.
Then relationship becomes not a process of isolation but a movement in which you discover your own motives, your own thoughts, your own pursuits; and that very discovery is the beginning of liberation, the beginning of transformation.
IN ALL OUR experiences, there is always the experiencer, the observer, who is gathering to himself more and more or denying himself.
Is that not a wrong process and is that not a pursuit which does not bring about the creative state?
If it is a wrong process, can we wipe it out completely and put it aside?
That can come about only when I experience, not as a thinker experiences, but when I am aware of the false process and see that there is only a state in which the thinker is the thought.
So long as I am experiencing, so long as I am becoming, there must be this dualistic action; there must be the thinker and the thought, two separate processes at work; there is no integration, there is always a centre which is operating through the will of action to be or not to be—collectively, individually, nationally and so on.
Universally, this is the process.
So long as effort is divided into the experiencer and the experience, there must be deterioration.
Integration is only possible when the thinker is no longer the observer.
That is, we know at present there are the thinker and the thought, the observer and the observed, the experiencer and the experienced; there are two different states.
Our effort is to bridge the two.
The will of action is always dualistic.
Is it possible to go beyond this will which is separative and discover a state in which this dualistic action is not?
That can only be found when we directly experience the state in which the thinker is the thought.
We now think the thought is separate from the thinker; but is that so?
We would like to think it is, because then the thinker can explain matters through his thought.
The effort of the thinker is to become more or become less; and therefore, in that struggle, in that action of the will, in ‘becoming’, there is always the deteriorating factor; we are pursuing a false process and not a true process.
Is there a division between the thinker and the thought?
So long as they are separate, divided, our effort is wasted; we are pursuing a false process which is destructive and which is the deteriorating factor.
We think the thinker is separate from his thought.
When I find that I am greedy, possessive, brutal, I think I should not be all this.
The thinker then tries to alter his thoughts and therefore effort is made to ‘become’; in that process of effort he pursues the false illusion that there are two separate processes, whereas there is only one process.
I think therein lies the fundamental factor of deterioration.
Is it possible to experience that state when there is only one entity and not two separate processes, the experiencer and the experience?
Then perhaps we shall find out what it is to be creative, and what the state is in which there is no deterioration at any time, in whatever relationship man may be.
I am greedy.
I and greed are not two different states; there is only one thing and that is greed.
If I am aware that I am greedy, what happens?
I make an effort not to be greedy, either for sociological reasons or for religious reasons; that effort will always be in a small limited circle; I may extend the circle but it is always limited.
Therefore the deteriorating factor is there.
But when I look a little more deeply and closely, I see that the maker of effort is the cause of greed and he is greed itself; and I also see that there is no ‘me’ and greed, existing separately, but that there is only greed.
If I realize that I am greedy, that there is not the observer who is greedy but I am myself greed, then our whole question is entirely different; our response to it is entirely different; then our effort is not destructive.
What will you do when your whole being is greed, when whatever action you do is greed?
Unfortunately, we don’t think along those lines.
There is the ‘me’, the superior entity, the soldier who is controlling, dominating.
To me that process is destructive.
It is an illusion and we know why we do it.
I divide myself into the high and the low in order to continue.
If there is only greed, completely, not ‘I’ operating greed, but I am entirely greed, then what happens?
Surely then there is a different process at work altogether, a different problem comes into being.
It is that problem which is creative, in which there is no sense of ‘I’ dominating, becoming, positively or negatively.
We must come to that state if we would be creative.
In that state, there is no maker of effort.
It is not a matter of verbalizing or of trying to find out what that state is; if you set about it in that way you will lose and you will never find.
What is important is to see that the maker of effort and the object towards which he is making effort are the same.
That requires enormously great understanding, watchfulness, to see how the mind divides itself into the high and the low—the high being the security, the permanent entity—but still remaining a process of thought and therefore of time.
If we can understand this as direct experience, then you will see that quite a different factor comes into being.
THOUGHT HAS NOT solved our problems and I don’t think it ever will.
We have relied on the intellect to show us the way out of our complexity.
The more cunning, the more hideous, the more subtle the intellect is, the greater the variety of systems, of theories, of ideas.
And ideas do not solve any of our human problems; they never have and they never will.
The mind is not the solution; the way of thought is obviously not the way out of our difficulty.
It seems to me that we should first understand this process of thinking, and perhaps be able to go beyond—for when thought ceases, perhaps we shall be able to find a way which will help us to solve our problems, not only the individual but also the collective.
Thinking has not solved our problems.
The clever ones, the philosophers, the scholars, the political leaders, have not really solved any of our human problems—which are the relationship between you and another, between you and myself.
So far we have used the mind, the intellect, to help us investigate the problem and thereby are hoping to find a solution.
Can thought ever dissolve our problems?
Is not thought, unless it is in the laboratory or on the drawing-board, always self-protecting, self-perpetuating, conditioned?
Is not its activity self-centred?
And can such thought ever resolve any of the problems which thought itself has created?
Can the mind, which has created the problems, resolve those things that it has itself brought forth?
Surely thinking is a reaction.
If I ask you a question, you respond to it—you respond according to your memory, to your prejudices, to your upbringing, to the climate, to thewhole background of your conditioning; you reply accordingly, you think accordingly.
The centre of this background is the ‘me’ in the process of action.
So long as that background is not understood, so long as that thought process, that self which creates the problem, is not understood and put an end to, we are bound to have conflict, within and without, in thought, in emotion, in action.
No solution of any kind, however clever, however well thought out, can ever put an end to the conflict between man and man, between you and me.
Realizing this, being aware of how thought springs up and from what source, then we ask, “Can thought ever come to an end?”
That is one of the problems, is it not?
By thinking over the problem, have you resolved it?
Any kind of problem—economic, social, religious—has it ever been really solved by thinking?
In your daily life, the more you think about a problem, the more complex, the more irresolute, the more uncertain it becomes.
Is that not so?
—in our actual, daily life?
The more we think over a problem, the more we investigate, analyse and discuss it, the more complex it becomes.
So is it possible to look at the problem comprehensively, wholly?
How is this possible?
Because that, it seems to me, is our major difficulty.
When is that possible?
Surely it is only possible when the process of thinking—which has its source in the ‘me’, the self, in the background of tradition, of conditioning, of prejudice, of hope, of despair—has come to an end.
Can we look at it, without any movement to destroy or to encourage?
That is the problem, is it not?
If, in each one of us, the centre of the ‘me’ is non-existent, with its desire for power, position, authority, continuance, self-preservation, surely our problems will come to an end!
The self is a problem that thought cannot resolve.
There must be an awareness which is not of thought.
To be aware, without condemnation or justification, of the activities of the self—just to be aware—is sufficient.
If you are aware in order to find out how to resolve the problem, in order to transform it, in order to produce a result, then it is still within the field of the self, of the ‘me’.
So long as we are seeking a result, whether through analysis, through awareness, through constant examination of every thought, we are still within the field of thought, which is within the field of the ‘me’, of the ‘I’, of the ego, or what you will.
As long as the activity of the mind exists, surely there can be no love.
When there is love, we shall have no social problems.
But love is not something to be acquired.
The mind can seek to acquire it, like a new thought, a new gadget, a new way of thinking; but the mind cannot be in a state of love so long as thought is acquiring love.
So long as the mind is seeking to be in a state of non-greed, surely it is still greedy, is it not?
Similarly, so long as the mind wishes, desires, and practises in order to be in a state in which there is love, surely it denies that state, does it not?
Seeing this problem, this complex problem of living, and being aware of the process of our own thinking and realizing that it actually leads nowhere—when we deeply realize that, then surely there is a state of intelligence which is not individual or collective.
Then the problem of the relationship of the individual to society, of the individual to the community, of the individual to reality, ceases; because then there is only intelligence, which is neither personal nor impersonal.
It is this intelligence alone, I feel, that can solve our immense problems.
That cannot be a result; it comes into being only when we understand this whole total process of thinking, not only at the conscious level but also at the deeper, hidden levels of consciousness.
To understand any of these problems we have to have a very quiet mind, a very still mind, so that the mind can look at the problem without interposing ideas or theories, without any distraction.
That is one of our difficulties—because thought has become a distraction.
When I want to understand, look at something, I don’t have to think about it—I look at it.
The moment I begin to think, to have ideas, opinions about it, I am already in a state of distraction, looking away from the thing which I must understand.
So thought, when you have a problem, becomes a distraction —thought being an idea, opinion, judgement, comparison —which prevents us from looking and thereby understanding and resolving the problem.
Unfortunately for most of us thought has become so important.
You say, “How can I exist, be, without thinking?
How can I have a blank mind?
” To have a blank mind is to be in a state of stupor, idiocy or what you will, and your instinctive reaction is to reject it.
But surely a mind that is very quiet, a mind that is not distracted by its own thought, a mind that is open, can look at the problem very directly and very simply.
And it is this capacity to look without any distraction at our problems that is the only solution.
For that there must be a quiet, tranquil mind.
Such a mind is not a result, is not an end-product of a practice, of meditation, of control.
It comes into being through no form of discipline or compulsion or sublimation, without any effort of the ‘me’, of thought; it comes into being when I understand the whole process of thinking—when I can see a fact without any distraction.
In that state of tranquillity of a mind that is really still there is love.
And it is love alone that can solve all our human problems.
WHEN YOU OBSERVE your own mind you are observing not only the so-called upper levels of the mind but also watching the unconscious; you are seeing what the mind actually does, are you not?
That is the only way you can investigate.
Do not superimpose what it should do, how it should think or act and so on; that would amount to making mere statements.
That is if you say the mind should be this or should not be that, then you stop all investigation and all thinking; or, if you quote some high authority, then you equally stop thinking, don’t you?
If you quote Buddha, Christ or XYZ, there is an end to all pursuit, to all thinking and all investigation.
So one has to guard against that.
You must put aside all these subtleties of the mind if you would investigate this problem of the self together with me.
What is the function of the mind?
To find that out, you must know what the mind is actually doing.
What does your mind do?
It is all a process of thinking, is it not?
Otherwise, the mind is not there.
So long as the mind is not thinking, consciously or unconsciously, there is no consciousness.
We have to find out what the mind that we use in our everyday life, and also the mind of which most of us are unconscious, does in relation to our problems.
We must look at the mind as it is and not as it should be.
Now what is mind as it is functioning?
It is actually a process of isolation, is it not?
Fundamentally that is what the process of thought is.
It is thinking in an isolated form, yet remaining collective.
When you observe your own thinking, you will see it is an isolated, fragmentary process.
You are thinking according to your reactions, the reactions of yourmemory, of your experience, of your knowledge, of your belief.
You are reacting to all that, aren’t you?
If I say that there must be a fundamental revolution, you immediately react.
You will object to that word ‘revolution’ if you have got good investments, spiritual or otherwise.
So your reaction is dependent on your knowledge, on your belief, on your experience.
That is an obvious fact.
There are various forms of reaction.
You say “I must be brotherly”, “I must cooperate”, “I must be friendly”, “I must be kind”, and so on.
What are these?
These are all reactions; but the fundamental reaction of thinking is a process of isolation.
You are watching the process of your own mind, each one of you, which means watching your own action, belief, knowledge, experience.
All these give security, do they not?
They give security, give strength to the process of thinking.
That process only strengthens the ‘me’, the mind, the self—whether you call that self high or low.
All our religions, all our social sanctions, all our laws are for the support of the individual, the individual self, the separative action; and in opposition to that there is the totalitarian state.
If you go deeper into the unconscious, there too it is the same process that is at work.
There, we are the collective influenced by the environment, by the climate, by the society, by the father, the mother, the grandfather.
There again is the desire to assert, to dominate as an individual, as the ‘me’.
Is not the function of the mind, as we know it and as we function daily, a process of isolation?
Aren’t you seeking individual salvation?
You are going to be somebody in the future; or in this very life you are going to be a great man, a great writer.
Our whole tendency is to be separated.
Can the mind do anything else but that?
Is it possible for the mind not to think separatively, in a self-enclosed manner, fragmentarily?
That is impossible.
So we worship the mind; the mind is extraordinarily important.
The function of the mind is to be separated; otherwise your mind is not there.
Having cultivated this process for centuries we find we cannot co-operate; we can only be urged, compelled, driven by authority, fear, either economic or religious.
If that is the actual state, not only consciously but also at the deeper levels, in our motives, our intentions, our pursuits, how can there be co-operation?
How can there be intelligent coming together to do something?
Discipline then becomes imperative if we want to come together, to do things together.
Until we understand how to transcend this separative thinking, this process of giving emphasis to the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, whether in the collective form or in individual form, we shall not have peace; we shall have constant conflict and wars.
Our problem is how to bring an end to the separative process of thought.
Can thought ever destroy the self, thought being the process of verbalization and of reaction?
Thought is nothing else but reaction; thought is not creative.
Can such thought put an end to itself?
That is what we are trying to find out.
When I think along these lines: “I must discipline”, “I must think more properly”, “I must be this or that”, thought is compelling itself, urging itself, disciplining itself to be something or not to be something.
Is that not a process of isolation?
It is therefore not that integrated intelligence which functions as a whole, from which alone there can be co-operation.
How are you to come to the end of thought?
How do you set about it?
Will your so-called discipline destroy it?
Obviously, you have not succeeded all these long years, otherwise you would not be here.
Please examine the disciplining process, which is solely a thought process, in which there is subjection, repression, control, domination—all affecting the unconscious, which asserts itself later as you grow older.
Having tried for such a long time to no purpose, you must have found that discipline is obviously not the process to destroy the self.
The self cannot be destroyed through discipline, because discipline is a process of strengthening the self.
Yet all your religions support it; all your meditations, your assertions are based on this.
Will knowledge destroy the self?
Will belief destroy it?
In other words, will anything that we are at present doing, any of the activities in which we are at present engaged in order to get at the root of the self, will any of that succeed?
Is not all this a fundamental waste in a thought process which is a process of isolation, of reaction?
What do you do when you realize fundamentally or deeply that thought cannot end itself?
Watch yourself.
When you are fully aware of this fact, what happens?
You understand that any reaction is conditioned and that, through conditioning, there can be no freedom either at the beginning or at the end—and freedom is always at the beginning and not at the end.
When you realize that any reaction is a form of conditioning and therefore gives continuity to the self in different ways, what actually takes place?
You must be very clear in this matter.
Belief, knowledge, discipline, experience, the whole process of achieving a result or an end, ambition, becoming something in this life or in a future life—all these are a process of isolation, a process which brings destruction, misery, wars, from which there is no escape through collective action, however much you may be threatened with concentration camps and all the rest of it.
Are you aware of that fact?
What is the state of the mind which says “It is so”, “That is my problem”, “That is exactly where I am”, “I see what knowledge and discipline can do, what ambition does”?
Surely, if you see all that, there is already a different process at work.
We see the ways of the intellect but we do not see the way of love.
The way of love is not to be found through the intellect.
The intellect, with all its ramifications, with all its desires, ambitions, pursuits, must come to an end for love to come into existence.
Don’t you know that when you love, you co-operate, you are not thinking of yourself?
That is the highest form of intelligence—not when you love as a superior entity or when you are in a good position, which is nothing but fear.
When your vested interests are there, there can be no love; there is only the process of exploitation, born of fear.
So love can come into being only when the mind is not there.
Therefore you must understand the whole process of the mind, the function of the mind.
It is only when we know how to love each other that there can be co-operation, that there can be intelligent functioning, a coming together over any question.
Only then is it possible to find out what God is, what truth is.
Now, we are trying to find truth through intellect, through imitation—which is idolatry.
Only when you discard completely, through understanding, the whole structure of the self, can that which is eternal, timeless, immeasurable, come into being.
You cannot go to it; it comes to you.
I WOULD LIKE TO discuss or consider the question of self-deception, the delusions that the mind indulges in and imposes upon itself and upon others.
That is a very serious matter, especially in a crisis of the kind which the world is facing.
But in order to understand this whole problem of self-deception we must follow it not merely at the verbal level but intrinsically, fundamentally, deeply.
We are too easily satisfied with words and counter-words; we are worldly-wise; and, being worldly-wise, all that we can do is to hope that something will happen.
We see that the explanation of war does not stop war; there are innumerable historians, theologians and religious people explaining war and how it comes into being but wars still go on, perhaps more destructive than ever.
Those of us who are really earnest must go beyond the word, must seek this fundamental revolution within ourselves.
That is the only remedy which can bring about a lasting, fundamental redemption of mankind.
Similarly, when we are discussing this kind of self-deception, I think we should guard against any superficial explanations and rejoinders; we should, if I may suggest it, not merely listen to a speaker but follow the problem as we know it in our daily life; that is we should watch ourselves in thinking and in action, watch how we affect others and how we proceed to act from ourselves.
What is the reason, the basis, for self-deception?
How many of us are actually aware that we are deceiving ourselves?
Before we can answer the question “What is self-deception and how does it arise?
”, must we not be aware that we are deceiving ourselves?
Do we know that we are deceiving ourselves?
What do we mean by this deception?
I think it is very important, because the more we deceive ourselves the greater is the strength in the deception; for it gives us a certain vitality, a certain energy, a certain capacity which entails the imposing of our deception on others.
So gradually we are not only imposing deception on ourselves but on others.
It is an interacting process of self-deception.
Are we aware of this process?
We think we are capable of thinking very clearly, purposefully and directly; and are we aware that, in this process of thinking, there is self-deception?
Is not thought itself a process of search, a seeking of justification, of security, of self-protection, a desire to be well thought of, a desire to have position, prestige and power?
Is not this desire to be, politically, or religio-sociologically, the very cause of self-deception?
The moment I want something other than the purely materialistic necessities, do I not produce, do I not bring about, a state which easily accepts?
Take, for example, this: many of us are interested to know what happens after death; the older we are, the more interested we are.
We want to know the truth of it.
How shall we find it?
Certainly not by reading nor through the different explanations.
How will you find it out?
First, you must purge your mind completely of every factor that is in the way—every hope, every desire to continue, every desire to find out what is on that other side.
Because the mind is constantly seeking security, it has the desire to continue and hopes for a means of fulfilment, for a future existence.
Such a mind, though it is seeking the truth of life after death, reincarnation or whatever it is, is incapable of discovering that truth, is it not?
What is important is not whether reincarnation is true or not but how the mind seeks justification, through self-deception, of a fact which may or may not be.
What is important is the approach to the problem, with what motivation, with what urge, with what desire you come to it.
The seeker is always imposing this deception upon himself; no one can impose it upon him; he himself does it.
We create deception and then we become slaves to it.
The fundamental factor of self-deception is this constant desire to be something in this world and in the world hereafter.
We know the result of wanting to be something in this world; it is utter confusion, where each is competing with the other, each is destroying the other in the name of peace; you know the whole game we play with each other, which is an extraordinary form of self-deception.
Similarly, we want security in the other world, a position.
So we begin to deceive ourselves the moment there is this urge to be, to become or to achieve.
That is a very difficult thing for the mind to be free from.
That is one of the basic problems of our life.
Is it possible to live in this world and be nothing?
Then only is there freedom from all deception, because then only is the mind not seeking a result, the mind is not seeking a satisfactory answer, the mind is not seeking any form of justification, the mind is not seeking security in any form, in any relationship.
That takes place only when the mind realizes the possibilities and subtleties of deception and therefore, with understanding, abandons every form of justification, security—which means the mind is capable, then, of being completely nothing.
Is that possible?
So long as we deceive ourselves in any form, there can be no love.
So long as the mind is capable of creating and imposing upon itself a delusion, it obviously separates itself from collective or integrated understanding.
That is one of our difficulties; we do not know how to co-operate.
All that we know is that we try to work together towards an end which both of us bring into being.
There can be co-operation only when you and I have no common aim created by thought.
What is important to realize is that co-operation is only possible when you and I do not desire to be anything.
When you and I desire to be something, then belief and all the rest of it become necessary, a self-projected Utopia is necessary.
But if you and I are anonymously creating, without any self-deception, without any barriers of belief and knowledge, without a desire to be secure, then there is true co-operation.
Is it possible for us to co-operate, for us to be together without an end in view?
Can you and I work together without seeking a result?
Surely that is true co-operation, is it not?
If you and I think out, work out, plan out a result and we are working together towards that result, then what is the process involved?
Our thoughts, our intellectual minds, are of course meeting; but emotionally, the whole being may be resisting it, which brings about deception, which brings about conflict between you and me.
It is an obvious and observable fact in our everyday life.
You and I agree to do a certain piece of work intellectually but unconsciously, deeply, you and I are at battle with each other.
I want a result to my satisfaction; I want to dominate; I want my name to be ahead of yours, though I am said to be working with you.
So we both, who are creators of that plan, are really opposing each other, even though outwardly you and I agree as to the plan.
Is it not important to find out whether you and I can co-operate, commune, live together in a world where you and I are as nothing; whether we are able really and truly to co-operate not at the superficial level but fundamentally?
That is one of our greatest problems, perhaps the greatest.
I identify myself with an object and you identify yourself with the same object; both of us are interested in it; both of us are intending to bring it about.
Surely this process of thinking is very superficial, because through identification we bring about separation—which is so obvious in our everyday life.
You are a Hindu and I a Catholic; we both preach brotherhood, and we are at each other’s throats.
That is one of our problems, is it not?
Unconsciously and deeply, you have your beliefs and I have mine.
By talking about brotherhood, we have not solved the whole problem of beliefs but have only theoretically and intellectually agreed that this should be so; inwardly and deeply, we are against each other.
Until we dissolve those barriers which are a self-deception, which give us a certain vitality, there can be no co-operation between you and me.
Belief does not bring about co-operation; on the contrary, it divides.
They are concerned with the theories which are going to solve that problem.
They are not actually concerned with the problem itself but with the method by which the problem will be solved.
Therefore there must be contention between the two, because they are concerned with the idea and not with the problem.
Similarly, religious people are against each other, though verbally they say they have all one life, one God; you know all that.
Inwardly their beliefs, their opinions, their experiences are destroying them and are keeping them separate.
Experience becomes a dividing factor in our human relationship; experience is a way of deception.
If I have experienced something, I cling to it, I do not go into the whole problem of the process of experiencing but, because I have experienced, that is sufficient and I cling to it; thereby I impose, through that experience, self-deception.
Until we dissolve them, through understanding—not only at the superficial level, but at the deeper level also—there can be no peace in the world.
That is why it is important for those who are really serious, to understand this whole problem—the desire to become, to achieve, to gain—not only at the superficial level but fundamentally and deeply; otherwise there can be no peace in the world.
Truth is not something to be gained.
Love cannot come to those who have a desire to hold on to it, or who like to become identified with it.
Surely such things come when the mind does not seek, when the mind is completely quiet, no longer creating movements and beliefs upon which it can depend, or from which it derives a certain strength, which is an indication of self-deception.
It is only when the mind understands this whole process of desire that it can be still.
Only then is the mind not in movement to be or not to be; then only is there the possibility of a state in which there is no deception of any kind.
MOST OF US, I think, are aware that every form of persuasion, every kind of inducement, has been offered us to resist self-centred activities.
Religions, through promises, through fear of hell, through every form of condemnation, have tried in different ways to dissuade man from this constant activity that is born from the centre of the ‘me’.
These having failed, political organizations have taken over.
There again, persuasion; there again the ultimate Utopian hope.
Every form of legislation from the very limited to the extreme, including concentration camps, has been used and enforced against any form of resistance.
Yet we go on in our self-centred activity, which is the only kind of action we seem to know.
If we think about it at all, we try to modify; if we are aware of it, we try to change the course of it; but fundamentally, deeply, there is no transformation, there is no radical cessation of that activity.
The thoughtful are aware of this; they are also aware that when that activity from the centre ceases, only then can there be happiness.
Most of us take it for granted that self-centred activity is natural and that the consequential action, which is inevitable, can only be modified, shaped and controlled.
Now those who are a little more serious, more earnest, not sincere—because sincerity is the way of self-deception—must find out whether, being aware of this extraordinary total process of self-centred activity, one can go beyond.
To understand what this self-centred activity is, one must obviously examine it, look at it, be aware of the entire process.
If one can be aware of it, then there is the possibility of its dissolution; but to be aware of it requires a certain understanding, a certain intention to face the thing as it is and not to interpret, not to modify, not to condemn it.
We have to be aware of what we are doing, of all the activity which springs from that self-centred state; we must be conscious of it.
One of our primary difficulties is that the moment we are conscious of that activity, we want to shape it, we want to control it, we want to condemn it or we want to modify it, so we are seldom able to look at it directly.
When we do, very few of us are capable of knowing what to do.
All our relationships, with nature, with people, with ideas, are the outcome of that activity.
Knowing all this, what is one to do?
All such activity must voluntarily come to an end—not self-imposed, not influenced, not guided.
Most of us are aware that this self-centred activity creates mischief and chaos but we are only aware of it in certain directions.
Either we observe it in others and are ignorant of our own activities or being aware, in relationship with others, of our own self-centred activity we want to transform, we want to find a substitute, we want to go beyond.
Before we can deal with it we must know how this process comes into being, must we not?
In order to understand something, we must be capable of looking at it; and to look at it we must know its various activities at different levels, conscious as well as unconscious—the conscious directives, and also the self-centred movements of our unconscious motives and intentions.
I am only conscious of this activity of the ‘me’ when I am opposing, when consciousness is thwarted, when the ‘me’ is desirous of achieving a result, am I not?
Surely a man who pursues virtue consciously is unvirtuous.
Humility cannot be pursued, and that is the beauty of humility.
This self-centred process is the result of time, is it not?
So long as this centre of activity exists in any direction, conscious or unconscious, there is the movement of time and I am conscious of the past and the present in conjunction with the future.
The self-centred activity of the ‘me’ is a time process.
It is memory that gives continuity to the activity of the centre, which is the ‘me’.
If you watch yourself and are aware of this centre of activity, you will see that it is only the process of time, of memory, of experiencing and translating every experience according to a memory; you will also see that self-activity is recognition, which is also the process of the mind.
Can the mind be free from all this?
It may be possible at rare moments; it may happen to most of us when we do an unconscious, unintentional, unpurposive act; but is it possible for the mind ever to be completely free from self-centred activity?
That is a very important question to put to ourselves, because in the very putting of it, you will find the answer.
If you are aware of the total process of this self-centred activity, fully cognizant of its activities at different levels of your consciousness, then surely you have to ask yourselves if it is possible for that activity to come to an end.
Is it possible not to think in terms of time, not to think in terms of what I shall be, what I have been, what I am?
For from such thought the whole process of self-centred activity begins; there, also, begins the determination to become, the determination to choose and to avoid, which are all a process of time.
We see in that process infinite mischief, misery, confusion, distortion, deterioration.
Surely the process of time is not revolutionary.
In the process of time there is no transformation; there is only a continuity and no ending, there is nothing but recognition.
It is only when you have complete cessation of the time process, of the activity of the self, that there is a revolution, a transformation, the coming into being of the new.
Being aware of this whole total process of the ‘me’ in its activity, what is the mind to do?
It is only with renewal, it is only with revolution—not through evolution, not through the ‘me’ becoming, but through the ‘me’ completely coming to an end—that there is the new.
The time process cannot bring the new; time is not the way of creation.
I do not know if any of you have had a moment of creativity.
I am not talking of putting some vision into action; I mean that moment of creation when there is no recognition.
At that moment, there is that extraordinary state in which the ‘me’, as an activity through recognition, has ceased.
If we are aware, we shall see that in that state there is no experiencer who remembers, translates, recognizes and then identifies; there is no thought process, which is of time.
In that state of creation, of creativity of the new, which is timeless, there is no action of the ‘me’ at all.
Our question surely is: Is it possible for the mind to be in that state, not momentarily, not at rare moments, but—I would rather not use the words ‘everlasting’ or ‘for ever’, because that would imply time—but to be in that state without regard to time?
Surely that is an important discovery to be made by each one of us, because that is the door to love; all other doors are activities of the self.
Where there is action of the self, there is no love.
Love is not of time.
You cannot practise love.
If you do, then it is a self-conscious activity of the ‘me’ which hopes through loving to gain a result.
Love is not of time; you cannot come upon it through any conscious effort, through any discipline, through identification, which is all of the process of time.
The mind, knowing only the process of time, cannot recognize love.
Love is the only thing that is eternally new.
Since most of us have cultivated the mind, which is the result of time, we do not know what love is.
We talk about love; we say we love people, that we love our children, our wife, our neighbour, that we love nature; but the moment we are conscious that we love, self-activity has come into being; therefore it ceases to be love.
This total process of the mind is to be understood only through relationship—relationship with nature, with people, with our own projections, with everything about us.
Life is nothing but relationship.
Though we may attempt to isolate ourselves from relationship, we cannot exist without it.
Though relationship is painful we cannot run away, by means of isolation, by becoming a hermit and so on.
All these methods are indications of the activity of the self.
Seeing this whole picture, being aware of the whole process of time as consciousness, without any choice, without any determined, purposive intention, without the desire for any result, you will see that this process of time comes to an end voluntarily—not induced, not as a result of desire.
It is only when that process comes to an end that love is, which is eternally new.
We do not have to seek truth.
Truth is not something far away.
It is the truth about the mind, truth about its activities from moment to moment.
If we are aware of this moment-to-moment truth, of this whole process of time, that awareness releases consciousness or the energy which is intelligence, love.
So long as the mind uses consciousness as self-activity, time comes into being with all its miseries, with all its conflicts, with all its mischief, its purposive deceptions; and it is only when the mind, understanding this total process, ceases, that love can be.
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK a little about what is time, because I think the enrichment, the beauty and significance of that which is timeless, of that which is true, can be experienced only when we understand the whole process of time.
After all, we are seeking, each in his own way, a sense of happiness, of enrichment.
Surely a life that has significance, the riches of true happiness, is not of time.
Like love, such a life is timeless; and to understand that which is timeless, we must not approach it through time but rather understand time.
We must not utilize time as a means of attaining, realizing, apprehending the timeless.
That is what we are doing most of our lives: spending time in trying to grasp that which is timeless, so it is important to understand what we mean by time, because I think it is possible to be free of time.
It is interesting to realize that our lives are mostly spent in time—time, not in the sense of chronological sequence, of minutes, hours, days and years, but in the sense of psychological memory.
We live by time, we are the result of time.
Our minds are the product of many yesterdays and the present is merely the passage of the past to the future.
Our minds, our activities, our being, are founded on time; without time we cannot think, because thought is the result of time, thought is the product of many yesterdays and there is no thought without memory.
Memory is time; for there are two kinds of time, the chronological and the psychological.
There is time as yesterday by the watch and as yesterday by memory.
You cannot reject chronological time; it would be absurd—you would miss your train.
Obviously there is time as yesterday but is there time as the mind thinks of it?
Surely time, psychological time, is the product of the mind.
Without the foundation of thought there is no time—time merely being memory as yesterday in conjunction with to-day, which moulds to-morrow.
That is, memory of yesterday’s experience in response to the present is creating the future—which is still the process of thought, a path of the mind.
The thought process brings about psychological progress in time but is it real, as real as chronological time?
And can we use that time which is of the mind as a means of understanding the eternal, the timeless?
As I said, happiness is not of yesterday, happiness is not the product of time, happiness is always in the present, a timeless state.
I do not know if you have noticed that when you have ecstasy, a creative joy, a series of bright clouds surrounded by dark clouds, in that moment there is no time: there is only the immediate present.
The mind, coming in after the experiencing in the present, remembers and wishes to continue it, gathering more and more of itself, thereby creating time.
So time is created by the ‘more’; time is acquisition and time is also detachment, which is still an acquisition of the mind.
Therefore merely disciplining the mind in time, conditioning thought within the framework of time, which is memory, surely does not reveal that which is timeless.
Is transformation a matter of time?
Most of us are accustomed to think that time is necessary for transformation: I am something, and to change what I am into what I should be requires time.
I am greedy, with greed’s results of confusion, antagonism, conflict, and misery; to bring about the transformation, which is non-greed, we think time is necessary.
That is to say time is considered as a means of evolving something greater, of becoming something.
The problem is this: One is violent, greedy, envious, angry, vicious or passionate.
To transform what if, is time necessary?
First of all, why do we want to change what is, or bring about a transformation?
Because what we are dissatisfies us; it creates conflict, disturbance, and, disliking that state, we want something better, something nobler, more idealistic.
Therefore we desire transformation because there is pain, discomfort, conflict.
Is conflict overcome by time?
If you say it will be overcome by time, you are still in conflict.
You may say it will take twenty days or twenty years to get rid of conflict, to change what you are, but during that time you are still in conflict and therefore time does not bring about transformation.
When we use time as a means of acquiring a quality, a virtue or a state of being, we are merely postponing or avoiding what is; and I think it is important to understand this point.
Greed or violence causes pain, disturbance in the world of our relationship with another, which is society; and being conscious of this state of disturbance, which we term greed or violence, we say to ourselves, “I will get out of it in time.
I will practise nonviolence, I will practise non-envy, I will practise peace.
” Now, you want to practise non-violence because violence is a state of disturbance, conflict, and you think that in time you will gain non-violence and overcome the conflict.
What is actually happening?
Being in a state of conflict you want to achieve a state in which there is no conflict.
Now is that state of no conflict the result of time, of a duration?
Obviously not; because, while you are achieving a state of nonviolence, you are still being violent and are therefore still in conflict.
Our problem is, can a conflict, a disturbance, be overcome in a period of time, whether it be days, years or lives?
What happens when you say, “I am going to practise nonviolence during a certain period of time”?
The very practice indicates that you are in conflict, does it not?
You would not practise if you were not resisting conflict; you say the resistance to conflict is necessary in order to overcome conflict and for that resistance you must have time.
But the very resistance to conflict is itself a form of conflict.
You are spending your energy in resisting conflict in the form of what you call greed, envy or violence but your mind is still in conflict, so it is important to see the falseness of the process of depending on time as a means of overcoming violence and thereby be free of that process.
Then you are able to be what you are: a psychological disturbance which is violence itself.
To understand anything, any human or scientific problem, what is important, what is essential?
A quiet mind, is it not?, a mind that is intent on understanding.
It is not a mind that is exclusive, that is trying to concentrate—which again is an effort of resistance.
If I really want to understand something, there is immediately a quiet state of mind.
When you want to listen to music or look at a picture which you love, which you have a feeling for, what is the state of your mind?
Immediately there is a quietness, is there not?
When you are listening to music, your mind does not wander all over the place; you are listening.
Similarly, when you want to understand conflict, you are no longer depending on time at all; you are simply confronted with what is, which is conflict.
Then immediately there comes a quietness, a stillness of mind.
When you no longer depend on time as a means of transforming what isbecause you see the falseness of that process, then you are confronted with what is, and as you are interested to understand what is, naturally you have a quiet mind.
In that alert yet passive state of mind there is understanding.
So long as the mind is in conflict, blaming, resisting, condemning, there can be no understanding.
If I want to understand you, I must not condemn you, obviously.
It is that quiet mind, that still mind, which brings about transformation.
When the mind is no longer resisting, no longer avoiding, no longer discarding or blaming what is but is simply passively aware, then in that passivity of the mind you will find, if you really go into the problem, that there comes a transformation.
Revolution is only possible now, not in the future; regeneration is to-day, not to-morrow.
If you will experiment with what I have been saying, you will find that there is immediate regeneration, a newness, a quality of freshness; because the mind is always still when it is interested, when it desires or has the intention to understand.
The difficulty with most of us is that we have not the intention to understand, because we are afraid that, if we understood, it might bring about a revolutionary action in our life and therefore we resist.
It is the defence mechanism that is at work when we use time or an ideal as a means of gradual transformation.
Thus regeneration is only possible in the present, not in the future, not to-morrow.
A man who relies on time as a means through which he can gain happiness or realize truth or God is merely deceiving himself; he is living in ignorance and therefore in conflict.
A man who sees that time is not the way out of our difficulty and who is therefore free from the false, such a man naturally has the intention to understand; therefore his mind is quiet spontaneously, without compulsion, without practice.
When the mind is still, tranquil, not seeking any answer or any solution, neither resisting nor avoiding—it is only then that there can be a regeneration, because then the mind is capable of perceiving what is true; and it is truth that liberates, not your effort to be free.
WE SEE THAT A radical change is necessary in society, in ourselves, in our individual and group relationships; how is it to be brought about?
If change is through conformity to a pattern projected by the mind, through a reasonable, well studied plan, then it is still within the field of the mind; therefore whatever the mind calculates becomes the end, the vision for which we are willing to sacrifice ourselves and others.
If you maintain that, then it follows that we as human beings are merely the creation of the mind, which implies conformity, compulsion, brutality, dictatorships, concentration camps—the whole business.
When we worship the mind, all that is implied, is it not?
If I realize this, if I see the futility of discipline, of control, if I see that the various forms of suppression only strengthen the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, then what am I to do?
To consider this problem fully we must go into the question of what is consciousness.
I wonder if you have thought about it for yourself or have merely quoted what authorities have said about consciousness?
I do not know how you have understood from your own experience, from your own study of yourself, what this consciousness implies—not only the consciousness of everyday activity and pursuits but the consciousness that is hidden, deeper, richer and much more difficult to get at.
If we are to discuss this question of a fundamental change in ourselves and therefore in the world, and in this change to awaken a certain vision, an enthusiasm, a zeal, a faith, a hope, a certainty which will give us the necessary impetus for action—if we are to understand that, isn’t it necessary to go into this question of consciousness?
We can see what we mean by consciousness at the superficial level of the mind.
Obviously it is the thinking process, thought.
Thought is the result of memory, verbalization; it is the naming, recording and storing up of certain experiences, so as to be able to communicate; at this level there are also various inhibitions, controls, sanctions, disciplines.
With all this we are quite familiar.
When we go a little deeper there are all the accumulations of the race, the hidden motives, the collective and personal ambitions, prejudices, which are the result of perception, contact and desire.
This total consciousness, the hidden as well as the open, is centred round the idea of the ‘me’, the self.
When we discuss how to bring about a change we generally mean a change at the superficial level, do we not?
Through determination, conclusions, beliefs, controls, inhibitions, we struggle to reach a superficial end which we want, which we crave for, and we hope to arrive at that with the help of the unconscious, of the deeper layers of the mind; therefore we think it is necessary to uncover the depths of oneself.
But there is everlasting conflict between the superficial levels and the so-called deeper levels—all psychologists, all those who have pursued self-knowledge are fully aware of that.
Will this inner conflict bring about a change?
Is that not the most fundamental and important question in our daily life: how to bring about a radical change in ourselves?
Will mere alteration at the superficial level bring it about?
I feel, and surely you also must feel, that a fundamental change in one’s life is essential—a change which is not a mere reaction, which is not the outcome of the stress and strain of environmental demands.
How is one to bring about such a change?
Will the study of my own consciousness, of my activities, will the awareness of my thoughts and feelings, stilling the mind in order to observe without condemnation, will that process bring about a change?
Can there be change through belief, through identification with a projected image called the ideal?
Does not all this imply a certain conflict between what I am and what I should be?
Will conflict bring about fundamental change?
I am in constant battle within myself and with society, am I not?
There is a ceaseless conflict going on between what I am and what I want to be; will this conflict, this struggle bring about a change?
I see a change is essential; can I bring it about by examining the whole process of my consciousness, by struggling, by disciplining, by practising various forms of repression?
I feel such a process cannot bring about a radical change.
Of that one must be completely sure.
And if that process cannot bring about a fundamental transformation, a deep inward revolution, then what will?
How are you to bring about true revolution?
What is the power, the creative energy that brings about that revolution and how is it to be released?
You have tried disciplines, you have tried the pursuit of ideals and various speculative theories: that you are God, and that if you can realize that Godhood or experience the Atman, the highest, or what you will, then that very realization will bring about a fundamental change.
Suppose you assume, as most so-called religious people do, that there is in you, fundamentally, deeply, the essence of reality; and that if, through cultivating virtue, through various forms of discipline, control, suppression, denial, sacrifice, you can get into touch with that reality, then the required transformation will be brought about.
Having created the image, the idea, the theory, the belief, the hope, you then look to your creation to bring about this radical change.
One must first see the extraordinarily subtle activities of the ‘me’, of the mind, one must become aware of the ideas, beliefs, speculations and put them all aside, for they are really deceptions, are they not?
Others may have experienced reality; but if you have not experienced it, what is the good of speculating about it or imagining that you are in essence something real, immortal, godly?
That is still within the field of thought and anything that springs from thought is conditioned, is of time, of memory; therefore it is not real.
If one actually realizes that—not speculatively, not imaginatively or foolishly, but actually sees the truth that any activity of the mind in its speculative search, in its philosophical groping, any assumption, any imagination or hope is only self-deception—then what is the power, the creative energy that brings about this fundamental transformation?
Perhaps, in coming to this point, we have used the conscious mind; we have followed the argument, we have opposed or accepted it, we have seen it clearly or dimly.
To go further and experience more deeply requires a mind that is quiet and alert to find out, does it not?
It is no longer pursuing ideas because, if you pursue an idea, there is the thinker following what is being said and so you immediately create duality.
If you want to go further into this matter of fundamental change, is it not necessary for the active mind to be quiet?
Surely it is only when the mind is quiet that it can understand the enormous difficulty, the complex implications of the thinker and the thought as two separate processes, the experiencer and the experienced, the observer and the observed.
Revolution, this psychological, creative revolution in which the ‘me’ is not, comes only when the thinker and the thought are one, when there is no duality such as the thinker controlling thought; and I suggest it is this experience alone that releases the creative energy which in turn brings about a fundamental revolution, the breaking up of the psychological ‘me’.
We know the way of power—power through domination, power through discipline, power through compulsion.
Through political power we hope to change fundamentally; but such power only breeds further darkness, disintegration, evil, the strengthening of the ‘me’.
We are familiar with the various forms of acquisition, both individually and as groups, but we have never tried the way of love, and we don’t even know what it means.
Love is not possible so long as there is the thinker, the centre of the ‘me’.
Realizing all this, what is one to do?
Surely the only thing which can bring about a fundamental change, a creative, psychological release, is everyday watchfulness, being aware from moment to moment of our motives, the conscious as well as the unconscious.
When we realize that disciplines, beliefs, ideals only strengthen the ‘me’ and are therefore utterly futile—when we are aware of that from day to day, see the truth of it, do we not come to the central point when the thinker is constantly separating himself from his thought, from his observations, from his experiences?
So long as the ‘me’ is the observer, the one who gathers experience, strengthens himself through experience, there can be no radical change, no creative release.
That creative release comes only when the thinker is the thought—but the gap cannot be bridged by any effort.
In that awareness, if the mind pursues it ever more deeply and extensively without seeking an end, a goal, there comes a state in which the thinker and the thought are one.
In that state there is no effort, there is no becoming, there is no desire to change; in that state the ‘me’ is not, for there is a transformation which is not of the mind.
It is only when the mind is empty that there is a possibility of creation; but I do not mean this superficial emptiness which most of us have.
Most of us are superficially empty, and it shows itself through the desire for distraction.
We want to be amused, so we turn to books, to the radio, we run to lectures, to authorities; the mind is everlastingly filling itself.
I am not talking of that emptiness which is thoughtlessness.
On the contrary, I am talking of the emptiness which comes through extraordinary thoughtfulness, when the mind sees its own power of creating illusion and goes beyond.
Creative emptiness is not possible so long as there is the thinker who is waiting, watching, observing in order to gather experience, in order to strengthen himself.
Can the mind ever be empty of all symbols, of all words with their sensations, so that there is no experiencer who is accumulating?
Is it possible for the mind to put aside completely all the reasonings, the experiences, the impositions, authorities, so that it is in a state of emptiness?
You will not be able to answer this question, naturally; it is an impossible question for you to answer, because you do not know, you have never tried.
But, if I may suggest, listen to it, let the question be put to you, let the seed be sown; and it will bear fruit if you reallylisten to it, if you do not resist it.
It is only the new that can transform, not the old.
If you pursue the pattern of the old, any change is a modified continuity of the old; there is nothing new in that, there is nothing creative.
The creative can come into being only when the mind itself is new; and the mind can renew itself only when it is capable of seeing all its own activities, not only at the superficial level, but deep down.
When the mind sees its own activities, is aware of its own desires, demands, urges, pursuits, the creation of its own authorities, fears; when it sees in itself the resistance created by discipline, by control, and the hope which projects beliefs, ideals—when the mind sees through, is aware of this whole process, can it put aside all these things and be new, creatively empty?
You will find out whether it can or cannot only if you experiment without having an opinion about it, without wanting to experience that creative state.
If you want to experience it, you will; but what you experience is not creative emptiness, it is only a projection of desire.
If you desire to experience the new, you are merely indulging in illusion; but if you begin to observe, to be aware of your own activities from day to day, from moment to moment, watching the whole process of yourself as in a mirror, then, as you go deeper and deeper, you will come to the ultimate question of this emptiness in which alone there can be the new.
Truth, God or what you will, is not something to be experienced, for the experiencer is the result of time, the result of memory, of the past, and so long as there is the experiencer there cannot be reality.
There is reality only when the mind is completely free from the analyser, from the experiencer and the experienced.
Then you will find the answer, then you will see that the change comes without your asking, that the state of creative emptiness is not a thing to be cultivated—it is there, it comes darkly, without any invitation; only in that state is there a possibility of renewal, newness, revolution.
Question: You say the present crisis is without precedent.
In what way is it exceptional?
Krisknamurti: Obviously the present crisis throughout the world is exceptional, without precedent.
There have been crises of varying types at different periods throughout history, social, national, political.
Crises come and go; economic recessions, depressions, come, get modified, and continue in a different form.
We know that; we are familiar with that process.
Surely the present crisis is different, is it not?
It is different first because we are dealing not with money nor with tangible things but with ideas.
The crisis is exceptional because it is in the field of ideation.
We are quarrelling with ideas, we are justifying murder; everywhere in the world we are justifying murder as a means to a righteous end, which in itself is unprecedented.
Before, evil was recognized to be evil, murder was recognized to be murder, but now murder is a means to achieve a noble result.
Murder, whether of one person or of a group of people, is justified, because the murderer, or the group that the murderer represents, justifies it as a means of achieving a result which will be beneficial to man.
That is we sacrifice the present for the future—and it does not matter what means we employ as long as our declared purpose is to produce a result which we say will be beneficial to man.
Therefore, the implication is that a wrong means will produce a right end and you justify the wrong means through ideation.
In the various crises that have taken place before, the issue has been the exploitation of things or of man; it is now the exploitation of ideas, which is much more pernicious, much more dangerous, because the exploitation of ideas is so devastating, so destructive.
We have learned now the power of propaganda and that is one of the greatest calamities that can happen: to use ideas as a means to transform man.
That is what is happening in the world to-day.
Man is not important—systems, ideas, have become important.
Man no longer has any significance.
We can destroy millions of men as long as we produce a result and the result is justified by ideas.
We have a magnificent structure of ideas to justify evil and surely that is unprecedented.
Evil is evil; it cannot bring about good.
War is not a means to peace.
War may bring about secondary benefits, like more efficient aeroplanes, but it will not bring peace to man.
War is intellectually justified as a means of bringing peace; when the intellect has the upper hand in human life, it brings about an unprecedented crisis.
There are other causes also which indicate an unprecedented crisis.
You are either a Mohammedan or a Hindu, a Christian or a Communist.
Name and property, caste and country, have become predominantly important, which means that man is caught in sensate value, the value of things, whether made by the mind or by the hand.
Things made by the hand or by the mind have become so important that we are killing, destroying, butchering, liquidating each other because of them.
We are nearing the edge of a precipice; every action is leading us there, every political, every economic action is bringing us inevitably to the precipice, dragging us into this chaotic, confusing abyss.
Therefore the crisis is unprecedented and it demands unprecedented action.
To leave, to step out of that crisis, needs a timeless action, an action which is not based on idea, on system, because any action which is based on a system, on an idea, will inevitably lead to frustration.
Such action merely brings us back to the abyss by a different route.
As the crisis is unprecedented there must also be unprecedented action, which means that the regeneration of the individual must be instantaneous, not a process of time.
It must take place now, not to-morrow; for tomorrow is a process of disintegration.
If I think of transforming myself to-morrow I invite confusion, I am still within the field of destruction.
Is it possible to change now?
Is it possible completely to transform oneself in the immediate, in the now?
I say it is.
The point is that as the crisis is of an exceptional character to meet it there must be revolution in thinking; and this revolution cannot take place through another, through any book, through any organization.
It must come through us, through each one of us.
Only then can we create a new society, a new structure away from this horror, away from these extraordinarily destructive forces that are being accumulated, piled up; and that transformation comes into being only when you as an individual begin to be aware of yourself in every thought, action and feeling.
Question: What is it that comes when nationalism goes?
Krishnamurti: Obviously, intelligence.
But I am afraid that is not the implication in this question.
Outwardly it brings about divisions between people, classifications, wars and destruction, which is obvious to anyone who is observant.
Inwardly, psychologically, this identification with the greater, with the country, with an idea, is obviously a form of self-expansion.
Living in a little village or a big town or whatever it may be, I am nobody; but if I identify myself with the larger, with the country, if I call myself a Hindu, it flatters my vanity, it gives me gratification, prestige, a sense of well-being; and that identification with the larger, which is a psychological necessity for those who feel that self-expansion is essential, also creates conflict, strife, between people.
Thus nationalism not only creates outward conflict but inward frustrations; when one understands nationalism, the whole process of nationalism, it falls away.
The understanding of nationalism comes through intelligence, by carefully observing, by probing into the whole process of nationalism, patriotism.
Out of that examination comes intelligence and then there is no substitution of something else for nationalism.
The moment you substitute religion for nationalism, religion becomes another means of self-expansion, another source of psychological anxiety, a means of feeding oneself through a belief.
Therefore any form of substitution, however noble, is a form of ignorance.
It is like a man substituting chewing-gum or betel-nut or whatever it is for smoking, whereas if one really understands the whole problem of smoking, of habits, sensations, psychological demands and all the rest of it, then smoking drops away.
You can understand only when there is a development of intelligence, when intelligence is functioning, and intelligence is not functioning when there is substitution.
Substitution is merely a form of self-bribery, to tempt you not to do this but to do that.
Nationalism, with its poison, with its misery and world strife, can disappear only when there is intelligence, and intelligence does not come merely by passing examinations and studying books.
Intelligence comes into being when we understand problems as they arise.
So when there is intelligence there is no substitution; and when there is intelligence, then nationalism, patriotism, which is a form of stupidity, disappears.
Question: You say that gurus are unnecessary, but how can I find truth without the wise help and guidance which only a guru can give?
Krishnamurti: The question is whether a guru is necessary or not.
Can truth be found through another?
Some say it can and some say it cannot.
We want to know the truth of this, not my opinion as against the opinion of another.
I have no opinion in this matter.
Either it is so or it is not.
Whether it is essential that you should or should not have a guru is not a question of opinion.
The truth of the matter is not dependent on opinion, however profound, erudite, popular, universal.
The truth of the matter is to be found out, in fact.
First of all, why do we want a guru?
We say we need a guru because we are confused and the guru is helpful; he will point out what truth is, he will help us to understand, he knows much more about life than we do, he will act as a father, as a teacher to instruct us in life; he has vast experience and we have but little; he will help us through his greater experience and so on and on.
That is, basically, you go to a teacher because you are confused.
If you were clear, you would not go near a guru.
Obviously if you were profoundly happy, if there were no problems, if you understood life completely, you would not go to any guru.
I hope you see the significance of this.
Because you are confused, you seek out a teacher.
You go to him to give you a way of life, to clarify your own confusion, to find truth.
You choose your guru because you are confused and you hope he will give you what you ask.
That is you choose a guru who will satisfy your demand; you choose according to the gratification he will give you and your choice is dependent on your gratification.
You do not choose a guru who says, “Depend on yourself”; you choose him according to your prejudices.
So since you choose your guru according to the gratification he gives you, you are not seeking truth but a way out of confusion; and the way out of confusion is mistakenly called truth.
Let us examine first this idea that a guru can clear up our confusion.
Can anyone clear up our confusion?
—confusion being the product of our responses.
We have created it.
Do you think someone else has created it—this misery, this battle at all levels of existence, within and without?
It is the result of our own lack of knowledge of ourselves.
It is because we do not understand ourselves, our conflicts, our responses, our miseries, that we go to a guru whom we think will help us to be free of that confusion.
We can understand ourselves only in relationship to the present; and that relationship itself is the guru, not someone outside.
If I do not understand that relationship, whatever a guru may say is useless, because if I do not understand relationship, my relationship to property, to people, to ideas, who can resolve the conflict within me?
To resolve that conflict, I must understand it myself, which means I must be aware of myself in relationship.
To be aware, no guru is necessary.
If I do not know myself, of what use is a guru?
As a political leader is chosen by those who are in confusion and whose choice therefore is also confused, so I choose a guru.
I can choose him only according to my confusion; hence he, like the political leader, is confused.
What is important is not who is right—whether I am right or whether those are right who say a guru is necessary; to find out why you need a guru is important.
Gurus exist for exploitation of various kinds, but that is irrelevant.
It gives you satisfaction if someone tells you how you are progressing, but to find out why you need a guru—there lies the key.
Another can point out the way but you have to do all the work, even if you have a guru.
Because you do not want to face that, you shift the responsibility to the guru.
No guru, no book or scripture, can give you self-knowledge: it comes when you are aware of yourself in relationship.
To be, is to be related; not to understand relationship is misery, strife.
Not to be aware of your relationship to property is one of the causes of confusion.
If you do not know your right relationship to property there is bound to be conflict, which increases the conflict in society.
If you do not understand the relationship between yourself and your wife, between yourself and your child, how can another resolve the conflict arising out of that relationship?
Similarly with ideas, beliefs and so on.
Being confused in your relationship with people, with property, with ideas, you seek a guru.
If he is a real guru, he will tell you to understand yourself.
You are the source of all misunderstanding and confusion; and you can resolve that conflict only when you understand yourself in relationship.
You cannot find truth through anybody else.
How can you?
Truth is not something static; it has no fixed abode; it is not an end, a goal.
On the contrary, it is living, dynamic, alert, alive.
How can it be an end?
If truth is a fixed point it is no longer truth; it is then a mere opinion.
Truth is the unknown, and a mind that is seeking truth will never find it, for mind is made up of the known, it is the result of the past, the outcome of time—which you can observe for yourself.
Mind is the instrument of the known, hence it cannot find the unknown; it can only move from the known to the known.
When the mind seeks truth, the truth it has read about in books, that ‘truth’ is self-projected; for then the mind is merely in pursuit of the known, a more satisfactory known than the previous one.
When the mind seeks truth, it is seeking its own self-projection, not truth.
After all, an ideal is self-projected; it is fictitious, unreal.
What is real is what is, not the opposite.
But a mind that is seeking reality, seeking God, is seeking the known.
When you think of God, your God is the projection of your own thought, the result of social influences.
You can think only of the known; you cannot think of the unknown, you cannot concentrate on truth.
The moment you think of the unknown, it is merely the self-projected known.
God or truth cannot be thought about.
If you think about it, it is not truth.
Truth cannot be sought: it comes to you.
You can go only after what is known.
When the mind is not tortured by the known, by the effects of the known, then only can truth reveal itself.
Truth is in every leaf, in every tear; it is to be known from moment to moment.
No one can lead you to truth; and if anyone leads you, it can only be to the known.
Truth can only come to the mind that is empty of the known.
It comes in a state in which the known is absent, not functioning.
The mind is the warehouse of the known, the residue of the known; for the mind to be in that state in which the unknown comes into being, it must be aware of itself, of its previous experiences, the conscious as well as the unconscious, of its responses, reactions, and structure.
When there is complete self-knowledge, then there is the ending of the known, then the mind is completely empty of the known.
It is only then that truth can come to you uninvited.
Truth does not belong to you or to me.
You cannot worship it.
The moment it is known, it is unreal.
The symbol is not real, the image is not real; but when there is the understanding of self, the cessation of self, then eternity comes into being.
Question: I gather definitely from you that learning and knowledge are impediments.
To what are they impediments?
Krishnamurti: Obviously knowledge and learning are an impediment to the understanding of the new, the timeless, the eternal.
Developing a perfect technique does not make you creative.
You may know how to paint marvellously, you may have the technique; but you may not be a creative painter.
You may know how to write poems, technically most perfect; but you may not be a poet.
To be a poet implies, does it not?, being capable of receiving the new; to be sensitive enough to respond to something new, fresh.
With most of us knowledge or learning has become an addiction and we think that through knowing we shall be creative.
A mind that is crowded, encased in facts, in knowledge—is it capable of receiving something new, sudden, spontaneous?
If your mind is crowded with the known, is there any space in it to receive something that is of the unknown?
Surely knowledge is always of the known; and with the known we are trying to understand the unknown, something which is beyond measure.
Take, for example, a very ordinary thing that happens to most of us: those who are religious—whatever that word may mean for the moment—try to imagine what God is or try to think about what God is.
They have read innumerable books, they have read about the experiences of the various saints, the Masters, the Mahatmas and all the rest, and they try to imagine or try to feel what the experience of another is; that is with the known you try to approach the unknown.
Can you do it?
Can you think of something that is not knowable?
You can only think of something that you know.
But there is this extraordinary perversion taking place in the world at the present time: we think we shall understand if we have more information, more books, more facts, more printed matter.
To be aware of something that is not the projection of the known, there must be the elimination, through the understanding, of the process of the known.
Why is it that the mind clings always to the known?
Is it not because the mind is constantly seeking certainty, security?
Its very nature is fixed in the known, in time; how can such a mind, whose very foundation is based on the past, on time, experience the timeless?
It may conceive, formulate, picture the unknown, but that is all absurd.
The unknown can come into being only when the known is understood, dissolved, put aside.
That is extremely difficult, because the moment you have an experience of anything, the mind translates it into the terms of the known and reduces it to the past.
I do not knew if you have noticed that every experience is immediately translated into the known, given a name, tabulated and recorded.
So the movement of the known is knowledge, and obviously such knowledge, learning, is a hindrance.
Suppose you had never read a book, religious or psychological, and you had to find the meaning, the significance of life.
How would you set about it?
Suppose there were no Masters, no religious organizations, no Buddha, no Christ, and you had to begin from the beginning.
First, you would have to understand your process of thinking, would you not?
—and not project yourself, your thoughts, into the future and create a God which pleases you; that would be too childish.
So first you would have to understand the process of your thinking.
That is the only way to discover anything new, is it not?
When we say that learning or knowledge is an impediment, a hindrance, we are not including technical knowledge—how to drive a car, how to run machinery—or the efficiency which such knowledge brings.
We have in mind quite a different thing: that sense of creative happiness which no amount of knowledge or learning will bring.
To be creative in the truest sense of that word is to be free of the past from moment to moment, because it is the past that is continually shadowing the present.
Merely to cling to information, to the experiences of others, to what someone has said, however great, and try to approximate your action to that—all that is knowledge, is it not?
But to discover anything new you must start on your own; you must start on a journey completely denuded, especially of knowledge, because it is very easy, through knowledge and belief, to have experiences; but those experiences are merely the products of self-projection and therefore utterly unreal, false.
If you are to discover for yourself what is the new, it is no good carrying the burden of the old, especially knowledge—the knowledge of another, however great.
You use knowledge as a means of self-protection, security, and you want to be quite sure that you have the same experiences as the Buddha or the Christ or X.
But a man who is protecting himself constantly through knowledge is obviously not a truth-seeker.
For the discovery of truth there is no path.
You must enter the uncharted sea—which is not depressing, which is not being adventurous.
When you want to find something new, when you are experimenting with anything, your mind has to be very quiet, has it not?
If your mind is crowded, filled with facts, knowledge, they act as an impediment to the new; the difficulty is for most of us that the mind has become so important, so predominantly significant, that it interferes constantly with anything that may be new, with anything that may exist simultaneously with the known.
Thus knowledge and learning are impediments for those who would seek, for those who would try to understand that which is timeless.
Question: All religions have insisted on some kind of self-discipline to moderate the instincts of the brute in man.
Through self-discipline the saints and mystics have asserted that they have attained godhood.
Now you seem to imply that such disciplines are a hindrance to the realization of God.
I am confused.
Who is right in this matter?
Krishnamurti: It is not a question of who is right in this matter.
You are caught between these two: someone says discipline, another says no discipline.
Generally what happens is that you choose what is more convenient, what is more satisfying: you like the man, his looks, his personal idiosyncrasies, his personal favouritism and all the rest of it.
Putting all that aside, let us examine this question directly and find out the truth of the matter for ourselves.
In this question a great deal is implied and we have to approach it very cautiously and tentatively.
Most of us want someone in authority to tell us what to do.
We look for a direction in conduct, because our instinct is to be safe, not to suffer more.
Someone is said to have realized happiness, bliss or what you will and we hope that he will tell us what to do to arrive there.
That is what we want: we want that same happiness, that same inward quietness, joy; and in this mad world of confusion we want someone to tell us what to do.
That is really the basic instinct with most of us and, according to that instinct, we pattern our action.
What is implied in discipline?
Why do we discipline ourselves, if we do?
Can discipline and intelligence go together?
Most people feel that we must, through some kind of discipline, subjugate or control the brute, the ugly thing in us.
Is that brute, that ugly thing, controllable through discipline?
What do we mean by discipline?
A course of action which promises a reward, a course of action which, if pursued, will give us what we want—it may be positive or negative; a pattern of conduct which, if practised diligently, sedulously, very, very ardently, will give me in the end what I want.
It may be painful but I am willing to go through it to get that.
The self, which is aggressive, selfish, hypocritical, anxious, fearful—you know, all of it—that self, which is the cause of the brute in us, we want to transform, subjugate, destroy.
How is this to be done?
Is it to be done through discipline, or through an intelligent understanding of the past of the self, what the self is, how it comes into being, and so on?
Shall we destroy the brute in man through compulsion or through intelligence?
Is intelligence a matter of discipline?
Let us for the time being forget what the saints and all the rest of the people have said; let us go into the matter for ourselves, as though we were for the first time looking at this problem; then we may have something creative at the end of it, not just quotations of what other people have said, which is all so vain and useless.
We first say that in us there is conflict, the black against the white, greed against non-greed and so on.
I am greedy, which creates pain; to be rid of that greed, I must discipline myself.
That is I must resist any form of conflict which gives me pain, which in this case I call greed.
I then say it is antisocial, it is unethical, it is not saintly and so on and so on—the various social-religious reasons we give for resisting it.
Is greed destroyed or put away from us through compulsion?
First, let us examine the process involved in suppression, in compulsion, in putting it away, resisting.
What happens when you do that, when you resist greed?
What is the thing that is resisting greed?
That is the first question, isn’t it?
Why do you resist greed and who is the entity that says, “I must be free of greed”?
The entity that says, “I must be free” is also greed, is he not?
Up to now, greed has paid him, but now it is painful; therefore he says, “I must get rid of it”.
The motive to get rid of it is still a process of greed, because he is wanting to be something which he is not.
Non-greed is now profitable, so I am pursuing non-greed; but the motive, the intention, is still to be something, to be non-greedy—which is still greed, surely; which is again a negative form of the emphasis on the ‘me’.
We find that being greedy is painful, for various reasons which are obvious.
So long as we enjoy it, so long as it pays us to be greedy, there is no problem.
Society encourages us in different ways to be greedy; so do religions encourage us in different ways.
So long as it is profitable, so long as it is not painful, we pursue it but the moment it becomes painful we want to resist it.
That resistance is what we call discipline against greed; but are we free from greed through resistance, through sublimation, through suppression?
First of all there must be a quiet mind, an undisturbed mind, to understand anything, especially something which I do not know, something which my mind cannot fathom—which, this questioner says, is God.
To understand anything, any intricate problem—of life or relationship, in fact any problem—there must be a certain quiet depth to the mind.
Is that quiet depth come by through any form of compulsion?
The superficial mind may compel itself, make itself quiet; but surely such quietness is the quietness of decay, death.
It is not capable of adaptability, pliability, sensitivity.
So resistance is not the way.
Now to see that requires intelligence, doesn’t it?
To see that the mind is made dull by compulsion is already the beginning of intelligence, isn’t it?
—to see that discipline is merely conformity to a pattern of action through fear.
That is what is implied in disciplining ourselves: we are afraid of not getting what we want.
What happens when you discipline the mind, when you discipline your being?
Don’t you know people who have disciplined themselves —if there are such people?
The result is obviously a process of decay.
There is an inward conflict which is put away, hidden away; but it is there, burning.
Thus we see that discipline, which is resistance, merely creates a habit and habit obviously cannot be productive of intelligence: habit never is, practice never is.
You may become very clever with your fingers by practising the piano all day, making something with your hands; but intelligence is demanded to direct the hands and we are now inquiring into that intelligence.
You see somebody whom you consider happy or as having realized, and he does certain things; you, wanting that happiness, imitate him.
This imitation is called discipline, isn’t it?
We imitate in order to receive what another has; we copy in order to be happy, which you think he is.
Is happiness found through discipline?
By practising a certain rule, by practising a certain discipline, a mode of conduct, are you ever free?
Surely there must be freedom for discovery, must there not?
If you would discover anything, you must be free inwardly, which is obvious.
Obviously you are not.
You are merely a repetitive machine, resisting according to a certain conclusion, according to a certain mode of conduct.
Freedom cannot come through discipline.
Freedom can only come into being with intelligence; and that intelligence is awakened, or you have that intelligence, the moment you see that any form of compulsion denies freedom, inwardly or outwardly.
The first requirement, not as a discipline, is obviously freedom; only virtue gives that freedom.
Greed is confusion; anger is confusion; bitterness is confusion.
When you see that, obviously you are free of them; you do not resist them but you see that only in freedom can you discover and that any form of compulsion is not freedom, and therefore there is no discovery.
What virtue does is to give you freedom.
The unvirtuous person is a confused person; in confusion, how can you discover anything?
Thus virtue is not the end-product of a discipline, but virtue is freedom and freedom cannot come through any action which is not virtuous, which is not true in itself.
Our difficulty is that most of us have read so much, most of us have superficially followed so many disciplines—getting up every morning at a certain hour, sitting in a certain posture, trying to hold our minds in a certain way—you know, practise, practise, discipline, because you have been told that if you do these things for a number of years you will have God at the end of it.
I may put it crudely, but that is the basis of our thinking.
Surely God doesn’t come so easily as all that?
God is not a mere marketable thing: I do this and you give me that.
Most of us are so conditioned by external influences, by religious doctrines, beliefs, and by our own inward demand to arrive at something, to gain something, that it is very difficult for us to think of this problem anew without thinking in terms of discipline.
God, reality or what you will—the name doesn’t matter—can come into being only when there is freedom, and there is no freedom where there is compulsion, positive or negative, through fear.
There is no freedom if you are seeking an end, for you are tied to that end.
You may be free from the past but the future holds you, and that is not freedom.
It is only in freedom that one can discover anything: a new idea, a new feeling, a new perception.
Any form of discipline which is based on compulsion denies that freedom, whether political or religious; and since discipline, which is conformity to an action with an end in view, is binding, the mind can never be free.
It can function only within that groove, like a gramophone record.
Thus, through practice, through habit, through cultivation of a pattern, the mind only achieves what it has in view.
Therefore it is not free; therefore it cannot realize that which is immeasurable.
To be aware of that whole process—why you are constantly disciplining yourself to public opinion; to certain saints; the whole business of conforming to opinion, whether of a saint or of a neighbour, it is all the same—to be aware of this whole conformity through practice, through subtle ways of submitting yourself, of denying, asserting, suppressing, sublimating, all implying conformity to a pattern: this is already the beginning of freedom, from which there is a virtue.
Non-greed, for instance, if pursued as an end is no longer virtue, is it?
That is if you are conscious that you are non-greedy, are you virtuous?
That is what we are doing through discipline.
Discipline, conformity, practice, only give emphasis to self-consciousness as being something.
The mind practises non-greed and therefore it is not free from its own consciousness as being non-greedy; therefore, it is not really non-greedy.
It has merely taken on a new cloak which it calls non-greed.
We can see the total process of all this: the motivation, the desire for an end, the conformity to a pattern, the desire to be secure in pursuing a pattern—all this is merely the moving from the known to the known, always within the limits of the mind’s own self-enclosing process.
To see all this, to be aware of it, is the beginning of intelligence, and intelligence is neither virtuous nor non-virtuous, it cannot be fitted into a pattern as virtue or non-virtue.
Intelligence brings freedom, which is not licentiousness, not disorder.
Without this intelligence there can be no virtue; virtue gives freedom and in freedom there comes into being reality.
If you see the whole process totally, in its entirety, then you will find there is no conflict.
It is because we are in conflict and because we want to escape from that conflict that we resort to various forms of disciplines, denials and adjustments.
When we see what is the process of conflict there is no question of discipline, because then we understand from moment to moment the ways of conflict.
Therefore, it is not a question of discipline.
Sensitivity can never come into being through compulsion.
You may compel a child to do something, put him in a corner, and he may be quiet; but inwardly he is probably seething, looking out of the window, doing something to get away.
That is what we are still doing.
So the question of discipline and of who is right and who is wrong can be solved only by yourself.
Also, you see, we are afraid to go wrong because we want to be a success.
Fear is at the bottom of the desire to be disciplined, but the unknown cannot be caught in the net of discipline.
On the contrary, the unknown must have freedom and not the pattern of your mind.
That is why the tranquillity of the mind is essential.
When the mind is conscious that it is tranquil, it is no longer tranquil; when the mind is conscious that it is non-greedy, free from greed, it recognizes itself in the new robe of non-greed but that is not tranquillity.
That is why one must also understand the problem in this question of the person who controls and that which is controlled.
They are not separate phenomena but a joint phenomenon: the controller and the controlled are one.
Question: I am beginning to realize that I am very lonely.
What am I to do?
Krishnamurti: The questioner wants to know why he feels loneliness?
Do you know what loneliness means and are you aware of it?
I doubt it very much, because we have smothered ourselves in activities, in books, in relationships, in ideas which really prevent us from being aware of loneliness.
What do we mean by loneliness?
It is a sense of being empty, of having nothing, of being extraordinarily uncertain, with no anchorage anywhere.
It is not despair, nor hopelessness, but a sense of void, a sense of emptiness and a sense of frustration.
I am sure we have all felt it, the happy and the unhappy, the very, very active and those who are addicted to knowledge.
They all know this.
It is the sense of real inexhaustible pain, a pain that cannot be covered up, though we do try to cover it up.
Let us approach this problem again to see what is actually taking place, to see what you do when you feel lonely.
You try to escape from your feeling of loneliness, you try to get on with a book, you follow some leader, or you go to a cinema, or you become socially very, very active, or you go and worship and pray, or you paint, or you write a poem about loneliness.
Becoming aware of loneliness, the pain of it, the extraordinary and fathomless fear of it, you seek an escape and that escape becomes more important and therefore your activities, your knowledge, your gods, your radios all become important, don’t they?
Our civilization is founded on it and that is a fact.
Have you ever tried to be alone?
When you do try, you will feel how extraordinarily difficult it is and how extraordinarily intelligent we must be to be alone, because the mind will not let us be alone.
The mind becomes restless, it busies itself with escapes, so what are we doing?
We are trying to fill this extraordinary void with the known.
We discover how to be active, how to be social; we know how to study, how to turn on the radio.
We are filling that thing which we do not know with the things we know.
We try to fill that emptiness with various kinds of knowledge, relationship or things.
That is our process, that is our existence.
Now when you realize what you are doing, do you still think you can fill that void?
You have tried every means of filling this void of loneliness.
Have you succeeded in filling it?
You have tried cinemas and you did not succeed and therefore you go after your gurus and your books or you become very active socially.
Have you succeeded in filling it or have you merely covered it up?
If you have merely covered it up, it is still there; therefore it will come back.
If you are able to escape altogether then you are locked up in an asylum or you become very, very dull.
That is what is happening in the world.
Can this emptiness, this void, be filled?
If not, can we run away from it, escape from it?
If we have experienced and found one escape to be of no value, are not all other escapes therefore of no value?
It does not matter whether you fill the emptiness with this or with that.
So-called meditation is also an escape.
It does not matter much that you change your way of escape.
How then will you find what to do about this loneliness?
You can only find what to do when you have stopped escaping.
When you are willing to face what is—which means you must not turn on the radio, which means you must turn your back to civilization—then that loneliness comes to an end, because it is completely transformed.
It is no longer loneliness.
If you understand what is then what is is the real.
Because the mind is continuously avoiding, escaping, refusing to see what is, it creates its own hindrances.
Because we have so many hindrances that are preventing us from seeing, we do not understand what is and therefore we are getting away from reality; all these hindrances have been created by the mind in order not to see what is.
To see what is not only requires a great deal of capacity and awareness of action but it also means turning your back on everything that you have built up, your bank account, your name and everything that we call civilization.
When you see what is, you will find how loneliness is transformed.
Question: What is the significance of pain and suffering?
Krishnamurti: When you suffer, when you have pain, what is the significance of it?
Physical pain has one significance but probably we mean psychological pain and suffering, which has quite a different significance at different levels.
What is the significance of suffering?
Why do you want to find the significance of suffering?
Not that it has no significance—we are going to find out.
But why do you want to find it?
Why do you want to find out why you suffer?
When I seek the significance of suffering, am I not avoiding, evading it, running away from it?
The fact is, I am suffering; but the moment I bring the mind to operate upon it and say, “Now, why?”,
I have already diluted the intensity of suffering.
In other words, we want suffering to be diluted, alleviated, put away, explained away.
Surely that doesn’t give an understanding of suffering.
If I am free from that desire to run away from it, then I begin to understand what is the content of suffering.
What is suffering?
A disturbance, isn’t it?, at different levels—at the physical and at the different levels of the subconscious.
It is an acute form of disturbance which I don’t like.
My son is dead.
I have built round him all my hopes—or round my daughter, my husband, what you will.
I have enshrined him with all the things I wanted him to be and I have kept him as my companion—you know, all that sort of thing.
Suddenly he is gone.
So there is a disturbance, isn’t there?
That disturbance I call suffering.
If I don’t like that suffering, then I say, “Why am I suffering?”,
“I loved him so much”, “He was this”, “I had that”.
I try to escape in words, in labels, in beliefs, as most of us do.
They act as a narcotic.
If I do not do that, what happens?
I am simply aware of suffering.
I don’t condemn it, I don’t justify it—I am suffering.
Then I can follow its movement, can’t I?
Then I can follow the whole content of what it means—T follow’ in the sense of trying to understand something.
What does it mean?
What is it that is suffering?
Not why there is suffering, not what is the cause of suffering, but what is actually happening?
I do not know if you see the difference.
Then I am able to follow its movement, see where it leads.
Surely if I do that it opens up, does it not?
Then I see that I have laid emphasis on the ‘me’—not on the person whom I love.
He only acted to cover me from my misery, from my loneliness, from my misfortune.
As I am not something, I hoped he would be that.
That has gone; I am left, I am lost, I am lonely.
Without him, I am nothing.
To come to that point is very difficult, isn’t it?
I am only taking this as an example.
Gradually, if I allow it to unfold, to open up, I see that I am suffering because I am lost; I am being called to give my attention to something which I am not willing to look at; something is being forced upon me which I am reluctant to see and to understand.
There are innumerable people to help me to escape—thousands of so-called religious people, with their beliefs and dogmas, hopes and fantasies—“it is karma, it is God’s will”—you know, all giving me a way out.
But if I can stay with it and not put it away from me, not try to circumscribe or deny it, then what happens?
What is the state of my mind when it is thus following the movement of suffering?
Is suffering merely a word, or an actuality?
If it is an actuality and not just a word, then the word has no meaning now, so there is merely the feeling of intense pain.
With regard to what?
With regard to an image, to an experience, to something which you have or have not.
If you have it, you call it pleasure; if you haven’t it is pain.
Therefore pain, sorrow, is in relationship to something.
Is that something merely a verbalization, or an actuality?
That is when sorrow exists, it exists only in relationship to something.
It cannot exist by itself—even as fear cannot exist by itself but only in relationship to something: to an individual, to an incident, to a feeling.
Now, you are fully aware of the suffering.
When there is no observer who is suffering, is the suffering different from you?
You are the suffering, are you not?
There is no labelling, there is no giving it a name and thereby brushing it aside—you are merely that pain, that feeling, that sense of agony.
When you are that, what happens?
When you do not name it, when there is no fear with regard to it, is the centre related to it?
If the centre is related to it, then it is afraid of it.
Then it must act and do something about it.
But if the centre is that, then what do you do?
There is nothing to be done, is there?
If you are that and you are not accepting it, not labelling it, not pushing it aside—if you are that thing, what happens?
Do you say you suffer then?
Surely, a fundamental transformation has taken place.
Then there is no longer “I suffer”, because there is no centre to suffer and the centre suffers because we have never examined what the centre is.
We just live from word to word, from reaction to reaction.
We never say, “Let me see what that thing is that suffers”.
You cannot see by enforcement, by discipline.
You must look with interest, with spontaneous comprehension.
Then you will see that the thing we call suffering, pain, the thing that we avoid, and the discipline, have all gone.
As long as I have no relationship to the thing as outside me, the problem is not; the moment I establish a relationship with it outside me, the problem is.
As long as I treat suffering as something outside—I suffer because I lost my brother, because I have no money, because of this or that—I establish a relationship to it and that relationship is fictitious.
But if I am that thing, if I see the fact, then the whole thing is transformed, it all has a different meaning.
Then there is full attention,integrated attention and that which is completely regarded is understood and dissolved, and so there is no fear and therefore the word ‘sorrow’ is non-existent.
Question: What is the difference between awareness and introspection?
And who is aware in awareness?
Krishnamurti: Let us first examine what we mean by introspection.
We mean by introspection looking within oneself, examining oneself.
Why does one examine oneself?
In order to improve, in order to change, in order to modify.
You introspect in order to become something, otherwise you would not indulge in introspection.
You would not examine yourself if there were not the desire to modify, change, to become something other than what you are.
That is the obvious reason for introspection.
I am angry and I introspect, examine myself, in order to get rid of anger or to modify or change anger.
Where there is introspection, which is the desire to modify or change the responses, the reactions of the self, there is always an end in view; when that end is not achieved, there is moodiness, depression.
Therefore introspection invariably goes with depression.
I don’t know if you have noticed that when you introspect, when you look into yourself in order to change yourself, there is always a wave of depression.
There is always a moody wave which you have to battle against; you have to examine yourself again in order to overcome that mood and so on.
Introspection is a process in which there is no release because it is a process of transforming what is into something which it is not.
Obviously that is exactly what is taking place when we introspect, when we indulge in that peculiar action.
In that action, there is always an accumulative process, the ‘I’ examining something in order to change it, so there is always a dualistic conflict and therefore a process of frustration.
There is never a release; and, realizing that frustration, there is depression.
Awareness is entirely different.
Awareness is observation without condemnation.
Awareness brings understanding, because there is no condemnation or identification but silent observation.
If I want to understand something, I must observe, I must not criticize, I must not condemn, I must not pursue it as pleasure or avoid it as non-pleasure.
There must merely be the silent observation of a fact.
There is no end in view but awareness of everything as it arises.
That observation and the understanding of that observation cease when there is condemnation, identification, or justification.
Introspection is self-improvement and therefore introspection is self-centredness.
Awareness is not self-improvement.
On the contrary, it is the ending of the self, of the ‘I’, with all its peculiar idiosyncrasies, memories, demands and pursuits.
In introspection there is identification and condemnation.
In awareness there is no condemnation or identification; therefore there is no self-improvement.
There is a vast difference between the two.
The man who wants to improve himself can never be aware, because improvement implies condemnation and the achievement of a result.
Whereas in awareness there is observation without condemnation, without denial or acceptance.
That awareness begins with outward things, being aware, being in contact with objects, with nature.
First, there is awareness of things about one, being sensitive to objects, to nature, then to people, which means relationship; then there is awareness of ideas.
This awareness, being sensitive to things, to nature, to people, to ideas, is not made up of separate processes, but is one unitary process.
It is a constant observation of everything, of every thought and feeling and action as they arise within oneself.
As awareness is not condemnatory, there is no accumulation.
You condemn only when you have a standard, which means there is accumulation and therefore improvement of the self.
Awareness is to understand the activities of the self, the ‘I’, in its relationship with people, with ideas and with things.
That awareness is from moment to moment and therefore it cannot be practised.
When you practise a thing, it becomes a habit and awareness is not habit.
This is not difficult.
It is what you actually do when you are interested in something, when you are interested in watching your child, your wife, your plants, the trees, the birds.
You observe without condemnation, without identification; therefore in that observation there is complete communion; the observer and the observed are completely in communion.
This actually takes place when you are deeply, profoundly interested in something.
Thus there is a vast difference between awareness and the self-expansive improvement of introspection.
Introspection leads to frustration, to further and greater conflict; whereas awareness is a process of release from the action of the self; it is to be aware of your daily movements, of your thoughts, of your actions and to be aware of another, to observe him.
You can do that only when you love somebody, when you are deeply interested in something; when I want to know myself, my whole being, the whole content of myself and not just one or two layers, then there obviously must be no condemnation.
Then I must be open to every thought, to every feeling, to all the moods, to all the suppressions; and as there is more and more expansive awareness, there is greater and greater freedom from all the hidden movement of thoughts, motives and pursuits.
Awareness is freedom, it brings freedom, it yields freedom, whereas introspection cultivates conflict, the process of self-enclosure; therefore there is always frustration and fear in it.
The questioner also wants to know who is aware.
When you have a profound experience of any kind, what is taking place?
When there is such an experience, are you aware that you are experiencing?
When you are angry, at the split second of anger or of jealousy or of joy, are you aware that you are joyous or that you are angry?
It is only when the experience is over that there is the experiencer and the experienced.
Then the experiencer observes the experienced, the object of experience.
At the moment of experience, there is neither the observer nor the observed: there is only the experiencing.
Most of us are not experiencing.
We are always outside the state of experiencing and therefore we ask this question as to who is the observer, who is it that is aware?
Surely such a question is a wrong question, is it not?
The moment there is experiencing, there is neither the person who is aware nor the object of which he is aware.
There is neither the observer nor the observed but only a state of experiencing.
Most of us find it is extremely difficult to live in a state of experiencing, because that demands an extraordinary pliability, a quickness, a high degree of sensitivity; and that is denied when we are pursuing a result, when we want to succeed, when we have an end in view, when we are calculating—all of which brings frustration.
A man who does not demand anything, who is not seeking an end, who is not searching out a result with all its implications, such a man is in a state of constant experiencing.
Everything then has a movement, a meaning; nothing is old, nothing is charred, nothing is repetitive, because what is is never old.
The challenge is always new.
It is only the response to the challenge that is old; the old creates further residue, which is memory, the observer, who separates himself from the observed, from the challenge, from the experience.
You can experiment with this for yourself very simply and very easily.
Next time you are angry or jealous or greedy or violent or whatever it may be, watch yourself.
In that state, ‘you’ are not.
There is only that state of being.
The moment, the second afterwards, you term it, you name it, you call it jealousy, anger, greed; so you have created immediately the observer and the observed, the experiencer and the experienced.
When there is the experiencer and the experienced, then the experiencer tries to modify the experience, change it, remember things about it and so on, and therefore maintains the division between himself and the experienced.
If you don’t name that feeling—which means you are not seeking a result, you are not condemning, you are merely silently aware of the feeling—then you will see that in that state of feeling, of experiencing, there is no observer and no observed, because the observer and the observed are a joint phenomenon and so there is only experiencing.
Therefore introspection and awareness are entirely different.
Introspection leads to frustration, to further conflict, for in it is implied the desire for change and change is merely a modified continuity.
Awareness is a state in which there is no condemnation, no justification or identification, and therefore there is understanding; in that state of passive, alert awareness there is neither the experiencer nor the experienced.
Introspection, which is a form of self-improvement, of self-expansion, can never lead to truth, because it is always a process of self-enclosure; whereas awareness is a state in which truth can come into being, the truth of what is, the simple truth of daily existence.
It is only when we understand the truth of daily existence that we can go far.
You must begin near to go far but most of us want to jump, to begin far without understanding what is close.
As we understand the near, we shall find the distance between the near and the far is not.
There is no distance—the beginning and the end are one.
Question: You have often talked of relationship.
What does it mean to you?
Krishnamurti: First of all, there is no such thing as being isolated.
To be is to be related and without relationship there is no existence.
What do we mean by relationship?
It is an interconnected challenge and response between two people, between you and me, the challenge which you throw out and which I accept or to which I respond; also the challenge I throw out to you.
The relationship of two people creates society; society is not independent of you and me; the mass is not by itself a separate entity but you and I in our relationship to each other create the mass, the group, the society.
Relationship is the awareness of interconnection between two people.
What is that relationship generally based on?
Is it not based on so-called interdependence, mutual assistance?
On mutual gratification, is it not?
If I do not please you, you get rid of me; if I please you, you accept me either as your wife or as your neighbour or as your friend.
That is the fact.
What is it that you call the family?
Obviously it is a relationship of intimacy, of communion.
In your family, in your relationship with your wife, with your husband, is there communion?
Surely that is what we mean by relationship, do we not?
Relationship means communion without fear, freedom to understand each other, to communicate directly.
Obviously relationship means that—to be in communion with another.
Are you in communion with your wife?
Perhaps you are physically but that is not relationship.
You and your wife live on opposite sides of a wall of isolation, do you not?
You have your own pursuits, your ambitions, and she has hers.
You live behind the wall and occasionally look over the top—and that you call relationship.
That is a fact, is it not?
You may enlarge it, soften it, introduce a new set of words to describe it but that is the fact—that you and another live in isolation, and that life in isolation you call relationship.
If there is real relationship between two people, which means there is communion between them, then the implications are enormous.
Then there is no isolation; there is love and not responsibility or duty.
Therefore he shares with another his joy, his sorrow, his money.
Are your families such?
Is there direct communion with your wife, with your children?
Therefore the family is merely an excuse to continue your name or tradition, to give you what you want, sexually or psychologically, so the family becomes a means of self-perpetuation, of carrying on your name.
That is one kind of immortality, one kind of permanency.
The family is also used as a means of gratification.
I exploit others ruthlessly in the business world, in the political or social world outside, and at home I try to be kind and generous.
I suffer in the world and I go home and try to find comfort.
So I use relationship as a means of gratification, which means I do not want to be disturbed by my relationship.
Thus relationship is sought where there is mutual satisfaction, gratification; when you do not find that satisfaction you change relationship; either you divorce or you remain together but seek gratification elsewhere or else you move from one relationship to another till you find what you seek —which is satisfaction, gratification, and a sense of self-protection and comfort.
After all, that is our relationship in the world, and it is thus in fact.
Relationship is sought where there can be security, where you as an individual can live in a state of security, in a state of gratification, in a state of ignorance—all of which always creates conflict, does it not?
If you do not satisfy me and I am seeking satisfaction, naturally there must be conflict, because we are both seeking security in each other; when that security becomes uncertain you become jealous, you become violent, you become possessive and so on.
So relationship invariably results in possession, in condemnation, in self-assertive demands for security, for comfort and for gratification, and in that there is naturally no love.
We talk about love, we talk about responsibility, duty, but there is really no love; relationship is based on gratification, the effect of which we see in the present civilization.
The way we treat our wives, children, neighbours, friends is an indication that in our relationship there is really no love at all.
It is merely a mutual search for gratification.
As this is so, what then is the purpose of relationship?
What is its ultimate significance?
If you observe yourself in relationship with others, do you not find that relationship is a process of self-revelation?
Does not my contact with you reveal my own state of being if I am aware, if I am alert enough to be conscious of my own reaction in relationship?
Relationship is really a process of self-revelation, which is a process of self-knowledge; in that revelation there are many unpleasant things, disquieting, uncomfortable thoughts, activities.
Since I do not like what I discover, I run away from a relationship which is not pleasant to a relationship which is pleasant.
Therefore, relationship has very little significance when we are merely seeking mutual gratification but becomes extraordinarily significant when it is a means of self-revelation and self-knowledge.
After all, there is no relationship in love, is there?
It is only when you love something and expect a return of your love that there is a relationship.
When you love, that is when you give yourself over to something entirely, wholly, then there is no relationship.
If you do love, if there is such a love, then it is a marvellous thing.
In such love there is no friction, there is not the one and the other, there is complete unity.
It is a state of integration, a complete being.
There are such moments, such rare, happy, joyous moments, when there is complete love, complete communion.
What generally happens is that love is not what is important but the other, the object of love becomes important; the one to whom love is given becomes important and not love itself.
Then the object of love, for various reasons, either biological, verbal or because of a desire for gratification, for comfort and so on, becomes important and love recedes.
Then possession, jealousy and demands create conflict and love recedes further and further; the further it recedes, the more the problem of relationship loses its significance, its worth and its meaning.
Therefore, love is one of the most difficult things to comprehend.
It cannot come through an intellectual urgency, it cannot be manufactured by various methods and means and disciplines.
It is a state of being when the activities of the self have ceased; but they will not cease if you merely suppress them, shun them or discipline them.
You must understand the activities of the self in all the different layers of consciousness.
We have moments when we do love, when there is no thought, no motive, but those moments are very rare.
Because they are rare we cling to them in memory and thus create a barrier between living reality and the action of our daily existence.
In order to understand relationship it is important to understand first of all what is, what is actually taking place in our lives, in all the different subtle forms; and also what relationship actually means.
Relationship is self-revelation; it is because we do not want to be revealed to ourselves that we hide in comfort, and then relationship loses its extraordinary depth, significance and beauty.
There can be true relationship only when there is love but love is not the search for gratification.
Love exists only when there is self-forgetfulness, when there is complete communion, not between one or two, but communion with the highest; and that can only take place when the self is forgotten.
Question: How can we solve our present political chaos and the crisis in the world?
Is there anything an individual can do to stop the impending war?
Krishnamurti: War is the spectacular and bloody projection of our everyday life, is it not?
War is merely an outward expression of our inward state, an enlargement of our daily action.
It is more spectacular, more bloody, more destructive, but it is the collective result of our individual activities.
Therefore, you and I are responsible for war and what can we do to stop it?
Obviously the ever-impending war cannot be stopped by you and me, because it is already in movement; it is already taking place, though at present chiefly on the psychological level.
As it is already in movement, it cannot be stopped—the issues are too many, too great, and are already committed.
But you and I, seeing that the house is on fire, can understand the causes of that fire, can go away from it and build in a new place with different materials that are not combustible, that will not produce other wars.
That is all that we can do.
You and I can see what creates wars, and if we are interested in stopping wars, then we can begin to transform ourselves, who are the causes of war.
An American lady came to see me a couple of years ago, during the war.
She said she had lost her son in Italy and that she had another son aged sixteen whom she wanted to save; so we talked the thing over.
I suggested to her that to save her son she had to cease to be an American; she had to cease to be greedy, cease piling up wealth, seeking power, domination, and be morally simple—not merely simple in clothes, in outward things, but simple in her thoughts and feelings, in her relationships.
She said, “That is too much.
You are asking far too much.
I cannot do it, because circumstances are too powerful for me to alter”.
Therefore she was responsible for the destruction of her son.
Circumstances can be controlled by us, because we have created the circumstances.
Society is the product of relationship, of yours and mine together.
If we change in our relationship, society changes; merely to rely on legislation, on compulsion, for the transformation of outward society, while remaining inwardly corrupt, while continuing inwardly to seek power, position, domination, is to destroy the outward, however carefully and scientifically built.
That which is inward is always overcoming the outward.
What causes war—religious, political or economic?
If we had no belief but goodwill, love and consideration between us, then there would be no wars.
But we are fed on beliefs, ideas and dogmas and therefore we breed discontent.
The present crisis is of an exceptional nature and we as human beings must either pursue the path of constant conflict and continuous wars, which are the result of our everyday action, or else see the causes of war and turn our back upon them.
Obviously what causes war is the desire for power, position, prestige, money; also the disease called nationalism, the worship of a flag; and the disease of organized religion, the worship of a dogma.
All these are the causes of war; if you as an individual belong to any of the organized religions, if you are greedy for power, if you are envious, you are bound to produce a society which will result in destruction.
So again it depends upon you and not on the leaders—not on so-called statesmen and all the rest of them.
It depends upon you and me but we do not seem to realize that.
We have three meals a day, we have our jobs, we have our bank accounts, big or little, and we say, “For God’s sake, don’t disturb us, leave us alone”.
The higher up we are, the more we want security, permanency, tranquillity, the more we want to be left alone, to maintain things fixed as they are; but they cannot be maintained as they are, because there is nothing to maintain.
Everything is disintegrating.
We do not want to face these things, we do not want to face the fact that you and I are responsible for wars.
You and I may talk about peace, have conferences, sit round a table and discuss, but inwardly, psychologically, we want power, position, we are motivated by greed.
We intrigue, we are nationalistic, we are bound by beliefs, by dogmas, for which we are willing to die and destroy each other.
Do you think such men, you and I, can have peace in the world?
To have peace, we must be peaceful; to live peacefully means not to create antagonism.
Peace is not an ideal.
To me, an ideal is merely an escape, an avoidance of what is, a contradiction of what is.
An ideal prevents direct action upon what is.
To have peace, we will have to love, we will have to begin not to live an ideal life but to see things as they are and act upon them, transform them.
As long as each one of us is seeking psychological security, the physiological security we need—food, clothing and shelter—is destroyed.
We are seeking psychological security, which does not exist; and we seek it, if we can, through power, through position, through titles, names—all of which is destroying physical security.
This is an obvious fact, if you look at it.
To bring about peace in the world, to stop all wars, there must be a revolution in the individual, in you and me.
Economic revolution without this inward revolution is meaningless, for hunger is the result of the maladjustment of economic conditions produced by our psychological states—greed, envy, ill-will and possessiveness.
To put an end to sorrow, to hunger, to war, there must be a psychological revolution and few of us are willing to face that.
We will discuss peace, plan legislation, create new leagues, the United Nations and so on and on; but we will not win peace because we will not give up our position, our authority, our money, our properties, our stupid lives.
To rely on others is utterly futile; others cannot bring us peace.
No leader is going to give us peace, no government, no army, no country.
What will bring peace is inward transformation which will lead to outward action.
Inward transformation is not isolation, is not a withdrawal from outward action.
On the contrary, there can be right action only when there is right thinking and there is no right thinking when there is no self-knowledge.
Without knowing yourself, there is no peace.
To put an end to outward war, you must begin to put an end to war in yourself.
Some of you will nod your heads and say, “I agree”, and go outside and do exactly the same as you have been doing for the last ten or twenty years.
Your agreement is merely verbal and has no significance, for the world’s miseries and wars are not going to be stopped by your casual assent.
They will be stopped only when you realize the danger, when you realize your responsibility, when you do not leave it to somebody else.
If you realize the suffering, if you see the urgency of immediate action and do not postpone, then you will transform yourself; peace will come only when you yourself are peaceful, when you yourself are at peace with your neighbour.
Question: How am I to get rid of fear, which influences all my activities?
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by fear?
Fear of what?
There are various types of fear and we need not analyse every type.
But we can see that fear comes into being when our comprehension of relationship is not complete.
Relationship is not only between people but between ourselves and nature, between ourselves and property, between ourselves and ideas; as long as that relationship is not fully understood, there must be fear.
Life is relationship.
To be is to be related and without relationship there is no life.
Nothing can exist in isolation; so long as the mind is seeking isolation, there must be fear.
Fear is not an abstraction; it exists only in relation to something.
The question is, how to be rid of fear?
First of all, anything that is overcome has to be conquered again and again.
No problem can be finally overcome, conquered; it can be understood but not conquered.
They are two completely different processes and the conquering process leads to further confusion, further fear.
To resist, to dominate, to do battle with a problem or to build a defence against it is only to create further conflict, whereas if we can understand fear, go into it fully step by step, explore the whole content of it, then fear will never return in any form.
As I said, fear is not an abstraction; it exists only in relationship.
What do we mean by fear?
Now, when there is fear of not being, of not advancing, or fear of the unknown, of death, can that fear be overcome by determination, by a conclusion, by any choice?
Mere suppression, sublimation, or substitution, creates further resistance, does it not?
Therefore fear can never be overcome through any form of discipline, through any form of resistance.
That fact must be clearly seen, felt and experienced: fear cannot be overcome through any form of defence or resistance nor can there be freedom from fear through the search for an answer or through mere intellectual or verbal explanation.
Now what are we afraid of?
Are we afraid of a fact or of an idea about the fact?
Are we afraid of the thing as it is, or are we afraid of what we think it is?
Take death, for example.
Are we afraid of the fact of death or of the idea of death?
The fact is one thing and the idea about the fact is another.
Am I afraid of the word ‘death’ or of the fact itself?
Because I am afraid of the word, of the idea, I never understand the fact, I never look at the fact, I am never in direct relation with the fact.
It is only when I am in complete communion with the fact that there is no fear.
If I am not in communion with the fact, then there is fear, and there is no communion with the fact so long as I have an idea, an opinion, a theory, about the fact, so I have to be very clear whether I am afraid of the word, the idea or of the fact.
If I am face to face with the fact, there is nothing to understand about it: the fact is there, and I can deal with it.
If I am afraid of the word, then I must understand the word, go into the whole process of what the word, the term, implies.
For example, one is afraid of loneliness, afraid of the ache, the pain of loneliness.
Surely that fear exists because one has never really looked at loneliness, one has never been in complete communion with it.
The moment one is completely open to the fact of loneliness one can understand what it is, but one has an idea, an opinion about it, based on previous knowledge; it is this idea, opinion, this previous knowledge about the fact, that creates fear.
Fear is obviously the outcome of naming, of terming, of projecting a symbol to represent the fact; that is fear is not independent of the word, of the term.
I have a reaction, say, to loneliness; that is I say I am afraid of being nothing.
Am I afraid of the fact itself or is that fear awakened because I have previous knowledge of the fact, knowledge being the word, the symbol, the image?
How can there be fear of a fact?
When I am face to face with a fact, in direct communion with it, I can look at it, observe it; therefore there is no fear of the fact.
What causes fear is my apprehension about the fact, what the fact might be or do.
It is my opinion, my idea, my experience, my knowledge about the fact, that creates fear.
So long as there is verbalization of the fact, giving the fact a name and therefore identifying or condemning it, so long as thought is judging the fact as an observer, there must be fear.
Thought is the product of the past, it can only exist through verbalization, through symbols, through images; so long as thought is regarding or translating the fact, there must be fear.
Thus it is the mind that creates fear, the mind being the process of thinking.
Thinking is verbalization.
You cannot think without words, without symbols, images; these images, which are the prejudices, the previous knowledge, the apprehensions of the mind, are projected upon the fact, and out of that there arises fear.
There is freedom from fear only when the mind is capable of looking at the fact without translating it, without giving it a name, a label.
This is quite difficult, because the feelings, the reactions, the anxieties that we have, are promptly identified by the mind and given a word.
The feeling of jealousy is identified by that word.
Is it possible not to identify a feeling, to look at that feeling without naming it?
It is the naming of the feeling that gives it continuity, that gives it strength.
The moment you give a name to that which you call fear, you strengthen it; but if you can look at that feeling without terming it, you will sec that it withers away.
Therefore if one would be completely free of fear it is essential to understand this whole process of terming, of projecting symbols, images, giving names to facts.
There can be freedom from fear only when there is self-knowledge.
Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, which is the ending of fear.
Question: I am not interested in anything, but most people are busy with many interests.
I don’t have to work, so I don’t.
Should I undertake some useful work?
Krishnamurti: Become a social worker or a political worker or a religious worker—is that it?
Why not be that?
If you are in sorrow, be sorrowful.
Don’t try to find a way out of it, because your being bored has an immense significance, if you can understand it, live with it.
If you say, “I am bored, therefore I will do something else”, you are merely trying to escape from boredom, and, as most of our activities are escapes, you do much more harm socially and in every other way.
The mischief is much greater when you escape than when you are what you are and remain with it.
The difficulty is, how to remain with it and not run away; as most of our activities are a process of escape it is immensely difficult for you to stop escaping and face it.
Why should you do anything?”
If you are bored, why are you bored?
What is the thing called boredom?
Why is it that you are not interested in anything?
There must be reasons and causes which have made you dull: suffering, escapes, beliefs, incessant activity, have made the mind dull, the heart unpliable.
If you could find out why you are bored, why there is no interest, then surely you would solve the problem, wouldn’t you?
Then the awakened interest will function.
If you are not interested in why you are bored, you cannot force yourself to be interested in an activity, merely to be doing something— like a squirrel going round in a cage.
I know that this is the kind of activity most of us indulge in.
But we can find out inwardly, psychologically, why we are in this state of utter boredom; we can see why most of us are in this state: we have exhausted ourselves emotionally and mentally; we have tried so many things, so many sensations, so many amusements, so many experiments, that we have become dull, weary.
We join one group, do everything wanted of us and then leave it; we then go to something else and try that.
If we fail with one psychologist, we go to somebody else or to the priest; if we fail there, we go to another teacher, and so on; we always keep going.
This process of constantly stretching and letting go is exhausting, isn’t it?
Like all sensations, it soon dulls the mind.
We have done that, we have gone from sensation to sensation, from excitement to excitement, till we come to a point when we are really exhausted.
Now, realizing that, don’t proceed any further; take a rest.
Let the mind gather strength by itself; don’t force it.
As the soil renews itself during the winter time, so, when the mind is allowed to be quiet, it renews itself.
But it is very difficult to allow the mind to be quiet, to let it lie fallow after all this, for the mind wants to be doing something all the time.
When you come to that point where you are really allowing yourself to be as you are—bored, ugly, hideous, or whatever it is—then there is a possibility of dealing with it.
What happens when you accept something, when you accept what you are?
When you accept that you are what you are, where is the problem?
There is a problem only when we do not accept a thing as it is and wish to transform it—which does not mean that I am advocating contentment; on the contrary.
If we accept what we are, then we see that the thing which we dreaded, the thing which we called boredom, the thing which we called despair, the thing which we called fear, has undergone a complete change.
There is a complete transformation of the thing of which we were afraid.
That is why it is important, as I said, to understand the process, the ways of our own thinking.
Self-knowledge cannot be gathered through anybody, through any book, through any confession, psychology, or psycho-analyst.
It has to be found by yourself, because it is your life; without the widening and deepening of that knowledge of the self, do what you will, alter any outward or inward circumstances, influences—it will ever be a breeding-ground of despair, pain, sorrow.
To go beyond the self-enclosing activities of the mind, you must understand them; and to understand them is to be aware of action in relationship, relationship to things, to people and to ideas.
In that relationship, which is the mirror, we begin to see ourselves, without any justification or condemnation; and from that wider and deeper knowledge of the ways of our own mind, it is possible to proceed further; it is possible for the mind to be quiet, to receive that which is real.
Question: If I am perfectly honest, I have to admit that I resent, and at times hate, almost everybody.
It makes my life very unhappy and painful.
I understand intellectually that I am this resentment, this hatred; but I cannot cope with it.
Can you show me a way?
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by ‘intellectually’?
When we say that we understand something intellectually, what do we mean by that?
Is there such a thing as intellectual understanding?
Or is it that the mind merely understands the words, because that is our only way of communicating with each other?
Can we, however, really understand anything merely verbally, mentally?
That is the first thing we have to be clear about: whether so-called intellectual understanding is not an impediment to understanding.
Either I understand something or I don’t.
To say to oneself, “I understand something intellectually”, is surely a barrier to understanding.
Now the question is this: “How am I, who am resentful, hateful, how am I to be free of, or cope with that problem?
” How do we cope with a problem?
What is a problem?
Surely, a problem is something which is disturbing.
I am resentful, I am hateful; I hate people and it causes pain.
And I am aware of it.
It is a very disturbing factor in my life.
What am I to do, how am I to be really free of it—not just momentarily slough it off but fundamentally be free of it?
How am I to do it?
It is a problem to me because it disturbs me.
If it were not a disturbing thing, it would not be a problem to me, would it?
Because it causes pain, disturbance, anxiety, because I think it is ugly, I want to get rid of it.
Therefore the thing that I am objecting to is the disturbance, isn’t it?
I give it different names at different times, in different moods; one day I call it this and another something else but the desire is, basically, not to be disturbed.
Isn’t that it?
Because pleasure is not disturbing, I accept it.
I don’t want to be free from pleasure, because there is no disturbance—at least, not for the time being, but hate, resentment, are very disturbing factors in my life and I want to get rid of them.
My concern is not to be disturbed and I am trying to find a way in which I shall never be disturbed.
Why should I not be disturbed?
I must be disturbed, to find out, must I not?
I must go through tremendous upheavals, turmoil, anxiety, to find out, must I not?
If I am not disturbed I shall remain asleep and perhaps that is what most of us do want—to be pacified, to be put to sleep, to get away from any disturbance, to find isolation, seclusion, security.
If I do not mind being disturbed—really, not just superficially, if I don’t mind being disturbed, because I want to find out—then my attitude towards hate, towards resentment, undergoes a change, doesn’t it?
If I do not mind being disturbed, then the name is not important, is it?
The word ‘hate’ is not important, is it?
Or ‘resentment’ against people is not important, is it?
Because then I am directly experiencing the state which I call resentment without verbalizing that experience.
Anger is a very disturbing quality, as hate and resentment are; and very few of us experience anger directly without verbalizing it.
If we do not verbalize it, if we do not call it anger, surely there is a different experience, is there not?
Because we term it, we reduce a new experience or fix it in the terms of the old, whereas, if we do not name it, then there is an experience which is directly understood and this understanding brings about a transformation in that experiencing.
Take, for example, meanness.
Most of us, if we are mean, are unaware of it—mean about money matters, mean about forgiving people, you know, just being mean.
I am sure we are familiar with that.
Now, being aware of it, how are we going to be free from that quality?
—not to become generous, that is not the important point.
To be free from meanness implies generosity, you haven’t got to become generous.
Obviously, one must be aware of it.
You may be very generous in giving a large donation to your society, to your friends, but awfully mean about giving a bigger tip—you know what I mean by ‘mean’.
One is unconscious of it.
When one becomes aware of it, what happens?
We exert our will to be generous; we try to overcome it; we discipline ourselves to be generous and so on and so on.
Please experiment with this.
First, one must be disturbed, and it is obvious that most of us do not like to be disturbed.
We think we have found a pattern of life—the Master, the belief, whatever it is—and there we settle down.
It is like having a good bureaucratic job and functioning there for the rest of one’s life.
With that same mentality we approach various qualities of which we want to be rid.
We do not see the importance of being disturbed, of being inwardly insecure, of not being dependent.
Surely it is only in insecurity that you discover, that you see, that you understand?
We want to be like a man with plenty of money, at ease; he will not be disturbed; he doesn’t want to be disturbed.
Disturbance is essential for understanding and any attempt to find security is a hindrance to understanding.
When we want to get rid of something which is disturbing, it is surely a hindrance.
If we can experience a feeling directly, without naming it, I think we shall find a great deal in it; then there is no longer a battle with it, because the experiencer and the thing experienced are one, and that is essential.
So long as the experiencer verbalizes the feeling, the experience, he separates himself from it and acts upon it; such action is an artificial, illusory action.
But if there is no verbalization, then the experiencer and the thing experienced are one.
That integration is necessary and has to be radically faced.
Question: Gossip has value in self-revelation, especially in revealing others to me.
Seriously, why not use gossip as a means of discovering what is?
I do not shiver at the word ‘gossip’ just because it has been condemned for ages.
Krishnamurti: I wonder why we gossip?
Not because it reveals others to us.
And why should others be revealed to us?
Why do you want to know others?
Why this extraordinary concern about others?
First of all, why do we gossip?
It is a form of restlessness, is it not?
Like worry, it is an indication of a restless mind.
Why this desire to interfere with others, to know what others are doing, saying?
It is a very superficial mind that gossips, isn’t it?
—an inquisitive mind which is wrongly directed.
The questioner seems to think that others are revealed to him by his being concerned with them—with their doings, with their thoughts, with their opinions.
But do we know others if we don’t know ourselves?
Can we judge others, if we do not know the way of our own thinking, the way we act, the way we behave?
Why this extraordinary concern over others?
Is it not an escape, really, this desire to find out what others are thinking and feeling and gossiping about?
Doesn’t it offer an escape from ourselves?
Is there not in it also the desire to interfere with others’ lives?
Isn’t our own life sufficiently difficult, sufficiently complex, sufficiently painful, without dealing with others’, interfering with others’?
Is there time to think about others in that gossipy, cruel, ugly manner?
Why do we do this?
You know, everybody does it.
Practically everybody gossips about somebody else.
I think, first of all, we gossip about others because we are not sufficiently interested in the process of our own thinking and of our own action.
We want to see what others are doing and perhaps, to put it kindly, to imitate others.
Generally, when we gossip it is to condemn others, but, stretching it charitably, it is perhaps to imitate others.
Why do we want to imitate others?
It is an extraordinarily dull mind that wants excitement, and goes outside itself to get it.
In other words, gossip is a form of sensation, isn’t it?, in which we indulge.
It may be a different kind of sensation, but there is always this desire to find excitement, distraction.
If one really goes into this question deeply, one comes back to oneself, which shows that one is really extraordinarily shallow and seeking excitement from outside by talking about others.
Catch yourself the next time you are gossiping about somebody; if you are aware of it, it will indicate an awful lot to you about yourself.
Don’t cover it up by saying that you are merely inquisitive about others.
It indicates restlessness, a sense of excitement, a shallowness, a lack of real, profound interest in people which has nothing to do with gossip.
The next problem is, how to stop gossip.
That is the next question, isn’t it?
When you are aware that you are gossiping, how do you stop gossiping?
If it has become a habit, an ugly thing that continues day after day, how do you stop it?
Does that question arise?
When you know you are gossiping, when you are aware that you are gossiping, aware of all its implications, do you then say to yourself, “How am I to stop it?
” Does it not stop of its own accord, the moment you are aware that you are gossiping?
The ‘how’ does not arise at all.
The ‘how’ arises only when you are unaware; and gossip indicates a lack of awareness.
Experiment with this for yourself the next time you are gossiping, and see how quickly, how immediately you stop gossiping when you are aware of what you are talking about, aware that your tongue is running away with you.
It does not demand the action of will to stop it.
All that is necessary is to be aware, to be conscious of what you are saying and to see the implications of it.
You don’t have to condemn or justify gossip.
Be aware of it and you will see how quickly you stop gossiping; because it reveals to oneself one’s own ways of action, one’s behaviour, thought-pattern; in that revelation, one discovers oneself, which is far more important than gossiping about others, about what they are doing, what they are thinking, how they behave.
Most of us who read daily newspapers are filled with gossip, global gossip.
It is all an escape from ourselves, from our own pettiness, from our own ugliness.
We think that through a superficial interest in world events we are becoming more and more wise, more capable of dealing with our own lives.
All these, surely, are ways of escaping from ourselves, are they not?
In ourselves we are so empty, shallow; we are so frightened of ourselves.
We are so poor in ourselves that gossip acts as a form of rich entertainment, an escape from ourselves.
We try to fill that emptiness in us with knowledge, with rituals, with gossip, with group meetings—with the innumerable ways of escape, so the escapes become all-important, and not the understanding of what is.
The understanding of what is demands attention; to know that one is empty, that one is in pain, needs immense attention and not escapes, but most of us like these escapes, because they are much more pleasurable, more pleasant.
Also, when we know ourselves as we are, it is very difficult to deal with ourselves; that is one of the problems with which we are faced.
We don’t know what to do.
When I know that I am empty, that I am suffering, that I am in pain, I don’t know what to do, how to deal with it.
So one resorts to all kinds of escapes.
The question is, what to do?
Obviously, of course, one cannot escape; for that is most absurd and childish.
But when you are faced with yourself as you are, what are you to do?
First, is it possible not to deny or justify it but just to remain with it, as you are?
—which is extremely arduous, because the mind seeks explanation, condemnation, identification.
If it does not do any of those things but remains with it, then it is like accepting something.
If I accept that I am brown, that is the end of it; but if I am desirous of changing to a lighter colour, then the problem arises.
To accept what is is most difficult; one can do that only when there is no escape and condemnation or justification is a form of escape.
Therefore when one understands the whole process of why one gossips and when one realizes the absurdity of it, the cruelty and all the things involved in it, then one is left with what one is; and we approach it always either to destroy it, or to change it into something else.
If we don’t do either of those things but approach it with the intention of understanding it, being with itcompletely, then we will find that it is no longer the thing that we dreaded.
Then there is a possibility of transforming that which is.
Question: What place has criticism in relationship?
What is the difference between destructive and constructive criticism?
Krishnamurti: First of all, why do we criticize?
Is it in order to understand?
Or is it merely a nagging process?
If I criticize you, do I understand you?
Does understanding come through judgement?
If I want to comprehend, if I want to understand not superficially but deeply the whole significance of my relationship to you, do I begin to criticize you?
Or am I aware of this relationship between you and me, silently observing it—not projecting my opinions, criticisms, judgements, identifications or condemnations, but silently observing what is happening?
And if I do not criticize, what happens?
One is apt to go to sleep, is one not?
Which does not mean that we do not go to sleep if we are nagging.
Perhaps that becomes a habit and we put ourselves to sleep through habit.
Is there a deeper, wider understanding of relationship, through criticism?
It doesn’t matter whether criticism is constructive or destructive—that is irrelevant, surely.
Therefore the question is: “What is the necessary state of mind and heart that will understand relationship?
” What is the process of understanding?
How do we understand something?
How do you understand your child, if you are interested in your child?
You observe, don’t you?
You watch him at play, you study him in his different moods; you don’t project your opinion on to him.
You don’t say he should be this or that.
Then, perhaps, you begin to understand the child.
Unfortunately most of us criticize in order to shape, in order to interfere; it gives us a certain amount of pleasure, a certain gratification, to shape something—the relationship with a husband, child or whoever it may be.
You feel a sense of power in it, you are the boss, and in that there is a tremendous gratification.
Surely through all that process there is no understanding of relationship.
Then there is self-criticism.
To be critical of oneself, to criticize, condemn, or justify oneself—does that bring understanding of oneself?
When I begin to criticize myself, do I not limit the process of understanding, of exploring?
Does introspection, a form of self-criticism, unfold the self?
What makes the unfoldment of the self possible?
To be constantly analytical, fearful, critical—surely that does not help to unfold.
What brings about the unfoldment of the self so that you begin to understand it is the constant awareness of it without any condemnation, without any identification.
There must be a certain spontaneity; you cannot be constantly analysing it, disciplining it, shaping it.
This spontaneity is essential to understanding.
If I merely limit, control, condemn, then I put a stop to the movement of thought and feeling, do I not?
It is in the movement of thought and feeling that I discover—not in mere control.
When one discovers, then it is important to find out how to act about it.
In that there is no understanding, there is no transcending.
If I can watch the self without any condemnation, without any identification, then it is possible to go beyond it.
That is why this whole process of approximating oneself to an ideal is so utterly wrong.
Ideals are home-made gods and to conform to a self-projected image is surely not a release.
Thus there can be understanding only when the mind is silently aware, observing—which is arduous, because we take delight in being active, in being restless, critical, in condemning, justifying.
That is our whole structure of being; and, through the screen of ideas, prejudices, points of view, experiences, memories, we try to understand.
Is it possible to be free of all these screens and so understand directly?
Surely we do that when the problem is very intense; we do not go through all these methods—we approach it directly.
The understanding of relationship comes only when this process of self-criticism is understood and the mind is quiet.
If you are listening to me and are trying to follow, with not too great an effort, what I wish to convey, then there is a possibility of our understanding each other.
But if you are all the time criticizing, throwing up your opinions, what you have learned from books, what somebody else has told you and so on and so on, then you and I are not related, because this screen is between us.
If we are both trying to find out the issues of the problem, which lie in the problem itself, if both of us are eager to go to the bottom of it, find the truth of it, discover what it is—then we are related.
Then your mind is both alert and passive, watching to see what is true in this.
Understanding comes, surely, when there is the swift pliability of a mind which is passively aware.
Then it is capable of reception, then it is sensitive.
A mind is not sensitive when it is crowded with ideas, prejudices, opinions, either for or against.
To understand relationship, there must be a passive awareness—which does not destroy relationship.
On the contrary, it makes relationship much more vital, much more significant.
Then there is in that relationship a possibility of real affection; there is a warmth, a sense of nearness, which is not mere sentiment or sensation.
If we can so approach or be in that relationship to everything, then our problems will be easily solved—the problems of property, the problems of possession, because we are that which we possess.
The man who possesses money is the money.
The man who identifies himself with property is the property or the house or the furniture.
Similarly with ideas or with people; when there is possessiveness, there is no relationship.
Most of us possess because we have nothing else if we do not possess.
We are empty shells if we do not possess, if we do not fill our life with furniture, with music, with knowledge, with this or that.
And that shell makes a lot of noise and that noise we call living; and with that we are satisfied.
When there is a disruption, a breaking away of that, then there is sorrow, because then you suddenly discover yourself as you are—an empty shell, without much meaning.
To be aware of the whole content of relationship is action, and from that action there is a possibility of true relationship, a possibility of discovering its great depth, its great significance and of knowing what love is.
Question: Belief in God has been a powerful incentive to better living.
Why do you deny God?
Why do you not try to revive man’s faith in the idea of God?
Krishnamurti: Let us look at the problem widely and intelligently.
I am not denying God—it would be foolish to do so.
Only the man who does not know reality indulges in meaningless words.
The man who says he knows, does not know; the man who is experiencing reality from moment to moment has no means of communicating that reality.
Belief is a denial of truth, belief hinders truth; to believe in God is not to find God.
Neither the believer nor the non-believer will find God; because reality is the unknown, and your belief or non-belief in the unknown is merely a self-projection and therefore not real.
I know you believe and I know it has very little meaning in your life.
There are many people who believe; millions believe in God and take consolation.
First of all, why do you believe?
You believe because it gives you satisfaction, consolation, hope, and you say it gives significance to life.
Actually your belief has very little significance, because you believe and exploit, you believe and kill, you believe in a universal God and murder each other.
The rich man also believes in God; he exploits ruthlessly, accumulates money, and then builds a temple or becomes a philanthropist.
The men who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima said that God was with them; those who flew from England to destroy Germany said that God was their co-pilot.
The dictators, the prime ministers, the generals, the presidents, all talk of God, they have immense faith in God.
Are they doing service, making a better life for man?
The people who saythey believe in God have destroyed half the world and the world is in complete misery.
Through religious intolerance there are divisions of people as believers and non-believers, leading to religious wars.
It indicates how extraordinarily politically-minded you are.
Is belief in God “a powerful incentive to better living”?
Why do you want an incentive to better living?
Surely, your incentive must be your own desire to live cleanly and simply, must it not?
If you look to an incentive, you are not interested in making life possible for all, you are merely interested in your incentive, which is different from mine—and we will quarrel over the incentive.
If we live happily together not because we believe in God but because we are human beings, then we will share the entire means of production in order to produce things for all.
Through lack of intelligence we accept the idea of a super-intelligence which we call ‘God’; but this ‘God’, this super-intelligence, is not going to give us a better life.
What leads to a better life is intelligence; and there cannot be intelligence if there is belief, if there are class divisions, if the means of production are in the hands of a few, if there are isolated nationalities and sovereign governments.
All this obviously indicates lack of intelligence and it is the lack of intelligence that is preventing a better living, not non-belief in God.
You all believe in different ways, but your belief has no reality whatsoever.
Reality is what you are, what you do, what you think, and your belief in God is merely an escape from your monotonous, stupid and cruel life.
Furthermore, belief invariably divides people: there is the Hindu, the Buddhist, the Christian, the communist, the socialist, the capitalist and so on.
Belief, idea, divides; it never brings people together.
You may bring a few people together in a group but that group is opposed to another group.
Ideas and beliefs are never unifying; on the contrary, they are separative, disintegrating and destructive.
Therefore your belief in God is really spreading misery in the world; though it may have brought you momentary consolation, in actuality it has brought you more misery and destruction in the form of wars, famines, class-divisions and the ruthless action of separate individuals.
So your belief has no validity at all.
If you really believed in God, if it were a real experience to you, then your face would have a smile; you would not be destroying human beings.
Now, what is reality, what is God?
God is not the word, the word is not the thing.
To know that which is immeasurable, which is not of time, the mind must be free of time, which means the mind must be free from all thought, from all ideas about God.
What do you know about God or truth?
You do not really know anything about that reality.
All that you know are words, the experiences of others or some moments of rather vague experience of your own.
Surely that is not God, that is not reality, that is not beyond the field of time.
To know that which is beyond time, the process of time must be understood, time being thought, the process of becoming, the accumulation of knowledge.
That is the whole background of the mind; the mind itself is the background, both the conscious and the unconscious, the collective and the individual.
So the mind must be free of the known, which means the mind must be completely silent, not made silent.
The mind that achieves silence as a result, as the outcome of determined action, of practice, of discipline, is not a silent mind.
Stillness comes only when you understand the whole process of thought, because to understand the process is to end it and the ending of the process of thought is the beginning of silence.
Only when the mind is completely silent not only on the upper level but fundamentally, right through, on both the superficial and the deeper levels of consciousness—only then can the unknown come into being.
The unknown is not something to be experienced by the mind; silence alone can be experienced, nothing but silence.
If the mind experiencesanything but silence, it is merely projecting its own desires and such a mind is not silent; so long as the mind is not silent, so long as thought in any form, conscious or unconscious, is in movement, there can be no silence.
Silence is freedom from the past, from knowledge, from both conscious and unconscious memory; when the mind is completely silent, not in use, when there is the silence which is not a product of effort, then only does the timeless, the eternal come into being.
That state is not a state of remembering—there is no entity that remembers, that experiences.
Therefore God or truth or what you will is a thing that comes into being from moment to moment, and it happens only in a state of freedom and spontaneity, not when the mind is disciplined according to a pattern.
God is not a thing of the mind, it does not come through self-projection, it comes only when there is virtue, which is freedom.
Virtue is facing the fact of what is and the facing of the fact is a state of bliss.
Only when the mind is blissful, quiet, without any movement of its own, without the projection of thought, conscious or unconscious—only then does the eternal come into being.
Question: Memory, you say, is incomplete experience.
I have a memory and a vivid impression of your previous talks.
In what sense is it an incomplete experience?
Please explain this idea in all its details.
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by memory?
You go to school and are full of facts, technical knowledge.
If you are an engineer, you use the memory of technical knowledge to build a bridge.
That is factual memory.
There is also psychological memory.
You have said something to me, pleasant or unpleasant, and I retain it; when I next meet you, I meet you with that memory, the memory of what you have said or have not said.
There are two facets to memory, the psychological and the factual.
They are always interrelated, therefore not clear cut.
We know that factual memory is essential as a means of livelihood but is psychological memory essential?
What is the factor which retains the psychological memory?
What makes one psychologically remember insult or praise?
Why does one retain certain memories and reject others?
Obviously one retains memories which are pleasant and avoids memories which are unpleasant.
If you observe, you will see that painful memories are put aside more quickly than the pleasurable ones.
Mind is memory, at whatever level, by whatever name you call it; mind is the product of the past, it is founded on the past, which is memory, a conditioned state.
Now with that memory we meet life, we meet a new challenge.
The challenge is always new and our response is always old, because it is the outcome of the past.
So experiencing without memory is one state and experiencing with memory is another.
That is there is a challenge, which is always new.
I meet it with the response, with the conditioning of the old.
So what happens?
I absorb the new, I do not understand it; and the experiencing of the new is conditioned by the past.
It is only when there is complete understanding of anything that it does not leave the scar of memory.
When there is a challenge, which is ever new, you meet it with the response of the old.
The old response conditions the new and therefore twists it, gives it a bias, therefore there is no complete understanding of the new so that the new is absorbed into the old and accordingly strengthens the old.
This may seem abstract but it is not difficult if you go into it a little closely and carefully.
The situation in the world at the present time demands a new approach, a new way of tackling the world problem, which is ever new.
We are incapable of approaching it anew because we approach it with our conditioned minds, with national, local, family and religious prejudices.
Our previous experiences are acting as a barrier to the understanding of the new challenge, so we go on cultivating and strengthening memory and therefore we never understand the new, we never meet the challenge fully, completely.
It is only when one is able to meet the challenge anew, afresh, without the past, only then does it yield its fruits, its riches.
Obviously, it is an incomplete experience if it is merely an impression, a memory.
If you understand what has been said, see the truth of it, that truth is not a memory.
Truth is not a memory, because truth is ever new, constantly transforming itself.
You have a memory of the previous talk.
Because you are using the previous talk as a guide, you have not fully understood it.
You want to go into it and unconsciously or consciously it is being maintained.
If you understand something completely, that is see the truth of something wholly, you will find there is no memory whatsoever.
Our education is the cultivation of memory, the strengthening of memory.
Your religious practices and rituals, your reading and knowledge, are all the strengthening of memory.
What do we mean by that?
Why do we hold to memory?
I do not know if you have noticed that, as one grows older, one looks back to the past, to its joys, to its pains, to its pleasures; if one is young, one looks to the future.
Why are we doing this?
Why has memory become so important?
For the simple and obvious reason that we do not know how to live wholly, completely in the present.
We are using the present as a means to the future and therefore the present has no significance.
We cannot live in the present because we are using the present as a passage to the future.
Because I am going to become something, there is never a complete understanding of myself, and to understand myself, what I am exactly now, does not require the cultivation of memory.
On the contrary, memory is a hindrance to the understanding of what is.
I do not know if you have noticed that a new thought, a new feeling, comes only when the mind is not caught in the net of memory.
When there is an interval between two thoughts, between two memories, when that interval can be maintained, then out of that interval a new state of being comes which is no longer memory.
We have memories, and we cultivate memory as a means of continuance.
If you had no memory, your property, your family, your ideas, would not be important as such; so to give strength to ‘me’ and ‘mine’, you cultivate memory.
If you observe, you will see that there is an interval between two thoughts, between two emotions.
In that interval, which is not the product of memory, there is an extraordinary freedom from the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ and that interval is timeless.
Let us look at the problem differently.
Surely memory is time, is it not?
Memory creates yesterday, to-day and tomorrow.
Memory of yesterday conditions to-day and therefore shapes to-morrow.
That is the past through the present creates the future.
There is a time process going on, which is the will to become.
Memory is time, and through time we hope to achieve a result.
I am a clerk to-day and, given time and opportunity, I will become the manager or the owner.
Therefore I must have time, and with the same mentality we say, “I shall achieve reality, I shall approach God”.
Therefore I must have time to realize, which means I must cultivate memory, strengthen memory by practice, by discipline, to be something, to achieve, to gain, which means continuation in time.
Through time we hope to achieve the timeless, through time we hope to gain the eternal.
Can you do that?
Can you catch the eternal in the net of time, through memory, which is of time?
The timeless can be only when memory, which is the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, ceases.
If you see the truth of that—that through time the timeless cannot be understood or received—then we can go into the problem of memory.
The memory of technical things is essential; but the psychological memory that maintains the self, the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, that gives identification and self-continuance, is wholly detrimental to life and to reality.
When one sees the truth of that, the false drops away; therefore there is no psychological retention of yesterday’s experience.
You see a lovely sunset, a beautiful tree in a field and when you first look at it, you enjoy it completely, wholly; but you go back to it with the desire to enjoy it again.
What happens when you go back with the desire to enjoy it?
There is no enjoyment, because it is the memory of yesterday’s sunset that is now making you return, that is pushing, urging you to enjoy.
Yesterday there was no memory, only a spontaneous appreciation, a direct response; to-day you are desirous of recapturing the experience of yesterday.
That is, memory is intervening between you and the sunset, therefore there is no enjoyment, there is no richness, fullness of beauty.
Again, you have a friend, who said something to you yesterday, an insult or a compliment and you retain that memory; with that memory you meet your friend to-day.
You do not really meet your friend—you carry with you the memory of yesterday, which intervenes.
So we go on, surrounding ourselves and our actions with memory, and therefore there is no newness, no freshness.
That is why memory makes life weary, dull and empty.
We live in antagonism with each other because the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ are strengthened through memory.
Memory comes to life through action in the present; we give life to memory through the present but when we do not give life to memory, it fades away.
Memory of facts, of technical things, is an obvious necessity, but memory as psychological retention is detrimental to the understanding of life, the communion with each other.
Question: What is the difference between surrendering to the will of God and what you are saying about the acceptance of what is?
You are not surrendering to something you do not know.
If you know reality, you cannot surrender to it; you cease to exist; there is no surrendering to a higher will.
If you are surrendering to a higher will, then that higher will is the projection of yourself, for the real cannot be known through the known.
It comes into being only when the known ceases to be.
The known is a creation of the mind, because thought is the result of the known, of the past, and thought can only create what it knows; therefore what it knows is not the eternal.
That is why, when you surrender to the will of God, you are surrendering to your own projections; it may be gratifying, comforting but it is not the real.
To understand what is demands a different process—perhaps the word ‘process’ is not right but what I mean is this: to understand what is is much more difficult, it requires greater intelligence, greater awareness, than merely to accept or give yourself over to an idea.
To understand what is does not demand effort; effort is a distraction.
Thus it is extraordinarily difficult and arduous to be aware of what is, because our very thinking has become a distraction.
We do not want to understand what is.
We look at what is through the spectacles of prejudice, of condemnation or of identification, and it is very arduous to remove these spectacles and to look at what is.
Surely what is is a fact, is the truth, and all else is an escape, is not the truth.
To understand what is, the conflict of duality must cease, because the negative response of becoming something other than what is is the denial of the understanding of what is.
If I want to understand arrogance I must not go into the opposite, I must not be distracted by the effort of becoming or even by the effort of trying to understand what is.
It is not a question of accepting what is; you do not accept what is, you do not accept that you are brown or white, because it is a fact; only when you are trying to become something else do you have to accept.
The moment you recognize a fact it ceases to have any significance; but a mind that is trained to think of the past or of the future, trained to run away in multifarious directions, such a mind is incapable of understanding what is.
Without understanding what is you cannot find what is real and without that understanding life has no significance, life is a constant battle wherein pain and suffering continue.
The real can only be understood by understanding what is.
It cannot be understood if there is any condemnation or identification.
The mind that is always condemning or identifying cannot understand; it can only understand that within which it is caught.
The understanding of what is, being aware of what is, reveals extraordinary depths, in which is reality, happiness and joy.
Question: Is not the longing expressed in prayer a way to God?
Krishnamurti: First of all, we are going to examine the problems contained in this question.
In it are implied prayer, concentration and meditation.
You, as an individual, are demanding, petitioning, begging, seeking guidance from something which you call God; therefore your approach is one of seeking a reward, seeking a gratification.
You are in trouble, national or individual, and you pray for guidance; or you are confused and you beg for clarity, you look for help to what you call God.
In this is implied that God, whatever God may be—we won’t discuss that for the moment —is going to clear up the confusion which you and I have created.
After all, it is we who have brought about the confusion, the misery, the chaos, the appalling tyranny, the lack of love, and we want what we call God to clear it up.
In other words, we want our confusion, our misery, our sorrow, our conflict, to be cleared away by somebody else, we petition another to bring us light and happiness.
Now when you pray, when you beg, petition for something, it generally comes into being.
When you ask, you receive; but what you receive will not create order, because what you receive does not bring clarity, understanding.
It only satisfies, gives gratification but does not bring about understanding, because, when you demand, you receive that which you yourself project.
You want something, you are longing for it, and in that moment of longing, of obsequious begging, you are fairly receptive; your conscious, active mind is comparatively still, so the unconscious projects itself into that and you have an answer.
It is surely not an answer from reality, from the immeasurable—it is your own unconscious responding.
So don’t let us be confused and think that when your prayer is answered you are in relationship with reality.
Reality must come to you; you cannot go to it.
In this problem of prayer there is another factor involved: the response of that which we call the inner voice.
As I said, when the mind is supplicating, petitioning, it is comparatively still; when you hear the inner voice, it is your own voice projecting itself into that comparatively still mind.
When the mind is absolutely still, when desire ceases, then only reality comes into being.
A person who is demanding, petitioning, supplicating, longing for direction will find what he seeks but it will not be the truth.
What he receives will be the response of the unconscious layers of his own mind which project themselves into the conscious; that still, small voice which directs him is not the real but only the response of the unconscious.
In this problem of prayer there is also the question of concentration.
With most of us, concentration is a process of exclusion.
Concentration is brought about through effort, compulsion, direction, imitation, and so concentration is a process of exclusion.
I am interested in so-called meditation but my thoughts are distracted, so I fix my mind on a picture, an image, or an idea and exclude all other thoughts.
This process of concentration, which is exclusion, is considered to be a means of meditating.
There is the constant interruption of other ideas, other thoughts, other emotions and you try to push them away; you spend your time battling with your thoughts.
This process you call meditation.
Prayer is not meditation and concentration as exclusion is not meditation.
A general who is planning war, butchery, is very concentrated.
A business man making money is very concentrated—he may even be ruthless, putting aside every other feeling and concentrating completely on what he wants.
A man who is interested in anything is naturally, spontaneously concentrated.
Such concentration is not meditation, it is merely exclusion.
Merely to concentrate or to pray does not bring understanding.
Understanding is the very basis, the fundamental process of meditation.
You don’t have to accept my word for it but if you examine prayer and concentration very carefully, deeply, you will find that neither of them leads to understanding.
They merely lead to obstinacy, to a fixation, to illusion.
Whereas meditation, in which there is understanding, brings about freedom, clarity and integration.
To be ignorant is to give wrong values; the very nature of stupidity is the lack of comprehension of right values.
Understanding comes into being when there are right values, when right values are established.
Therefore self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation—not the knowledge that you pick up from my books, from authorities, from gurus, but the knowledge that comes into being through self-inquiry, which is self-awareness.
Meditation is the beginning of self-knowledge and without self-knowledge there is no meditation.
If I don’t understand the ways of my thoughts, of my feelings, if I don’t understand my motives, my desires, my demands, my pursuit of patterns of action, which are ideas—if I do not know myself, there is no foundation for thinking; the thinker who merely asks, prays, or excludes, without understanding himself, must inevitably end in confusion, in illusion.
The beginning of meditation is self-knowledge, which means being aware of every movement of thought and feeling, knowing all the layers of my consciousness, not only the superficial layers but the hidden, the deeply concealed activities.
To know the deeply concealed activities, the hidden motives, responses, thoughts and feelings, there must be tranquillity in the conscious mind; that is the conscious mind must be still in order to receive the projection of the unconscious.
The superficial, conscious mind is occupied with its daily activities, with earning a livelihood, deceiving others, exploiting others, running away from problems—all the daily activities of our existence.
That superficial mind must understand the right significance of its own activities and thereby bring tranquillity to itself.
It cannot bring about tranquillity, stillness, by mere regimentation, by compulsion, by discipline.
It can bring about tranquillity, peace, stillness, only by understanding its own activities, by observing them, by being aware of them, by seeing its own ruthlessness, how it talks to the servant, to the wife, to the daughter, to the mother and so on.
When the superficial, conscious mind is thus fully aware of all its activities, through that understanding it becomes spontaneously quiet, not drugged by compulsion or regimented by desire; then it is in a position to receive the intimation, the hints of the unconscious, of the many, many hidden layers of the mind—the racial instincts, the buried memories, the concealed pursuits, the deep wounds that are still unhealed.
It is only when all these have projected themselves and are understood, when the whole consciousness is unburdened, unfettered by any wound, by any memory whatsoever, that it is in a position to receive the eternal.
Meditation is self-knowledge and without self-knowledge there is no meditation.
If you are not aware of all your responses all the time, if you are not fully conscious, fully cognizant of your daily activities, merely to lock yourself in a room and sit down in front of a picture of your guru, of your Master, to meditate, is an escape, because without self-knowledge there is no right thinking and, without right thinking, what you do has no meaning, however noble your intentions are.
Thus prayer has no significance without self-knowledge but when there is self-knowledge there is right thinking and hence right action.
When there is right action, there is no confusion and therefore there is no supplication to someone else to lead you out of it.
A man who is fully aware is meditating; he does not pray, because he does not want anything.
Through prayer, through regimentation, through repetition and all the rest of it, you can bring about a certain stillness, but that is mere dullness, reducing the mind and the heart to a state of weariness.
It is drugging the mind; and exclusion, which you call concentration, does not lead to reality—no exclusion ever can.
If you really want to know yourself, you will search out your heart and your mind to know their full content and when there is the intention to know, you will know.
Then you can follow, without condemnation or justification, every movement of thought and feeling; by following every thought and every feeling as it arises you bring about tranquillity which is not compelled, not regimented, but which is the outcome of having no problem, no contradiction.
It is like the pool that becomes peaceful, quiet, any evening when there is no wind; when the mind is still, then that which is immeasurable comes into being.
Question: The conscious mind is ignorant and afraid of the unconscious mind.
Krishnamurti: We are aware that there is the conscious and the unconscious mind but most of us function only on the conscious level, in the upper layer of the mind, and our whole life is practically limited to that.
Now the questioner asks, “You are addressing mainly the conscious mind and is that enough?” Let us see what we mean by the conscious mind.
Yet most of us cling to what the conscious mind has accepted, because the conscious mind finds it convenient to adjust to certain obvious facts; but the unconscious may rebel, and often does, and so there is conflict between the so-called conscious and the unconscious.
But that consciousness is always of the past, never of the present; you are conscious only of things that are over.
Watch your own hearts and minds and you will see that consciousness is functioning between the past and the future and that the present is merely a passage of the past to the future.
Consciousness is therefore a movement of the past to the future.
If you watch your own mind at work, you will see that the movement to the past and to the future is a process in which the present is not.
Either the past is a means of escape from the present, which may be unpleasant, or the future is a hope away from the present.
So the mind is occupied with the past or with the future and sloughs off the present.
It either condemns and rejects the fact or accepts and identifies itself with the fact.
Such a mind is obviously not capable of seeing any fact as a fact.
That is our state of consciousness which is conditioned by the past and our thought is the conditioned response to the challenge of a fact; the more you respond according to the conditioning of belief, of the past, the more there is the strengthening of the past.
That strengthening of the past is obviously the continuity of itself, which it calls the future.
So that is the state of our mind, of our consciousness—a pendulum swinging backwards and forwards between the past and the future.
That is our consciousness, which is made up not only of the upper layers of the mind but of the deeper layers as well.
Such consciousness obviously cannot function at a different level, because it only knows those two movements of backwards and forwards.
If you watch very carefully you will see that it is not a constant movement but that there is an interval between two thoughts; though it may be but an infinitesimal fraction of a second, there is an interval that has significance in the swinging backwards and forwards of the pendulum.
We see the fact that our thinking is conditioned by the past which is projected into the future; the moment you admit the past, you must also admit the future, because there are not two such states as the past and the future but one state which includes both the conscious and the unconscious, both the collective past and the individual past.
The collective and the individual past, in response to the present, give out certain responses which create the individual consciousness; therefore consciousness is of the past and that is the whole background of our existence.
The moment you have the past, you inevitably have the future, because the future is merely the continuity of the modified past but it is still the past, so our problem is how to bring about a transformation in this process of the past without creating another conditioning, another past.
You give up one religion and take on another, reject one form of belief and accept another.
Such substitution is obviously not understanding life, life being relationship.
Our problem is how to be free from all conditioning.
Either you say it is impossible, that no human mind can ever be free from conditioning, or you begin to experiment, to inquire, to discover.
If you assert that it is impossible, obviously you are out of the running.
Your assertion may be based on limited or wide experience or on the mere acceptance of a belief but such assertion is the denial of search, of research, of inquiry, of discovery.
To find out if it is possible for the mind to be completely free from all conditioning, you must be free to inquire and to discover.
Now I say it is definitely possible for the mind to be free from all conditioning—not that you should accept my authority.
If you accept it on authority, you will never discover, it will be another substitution and that will have no significance.
When I say it is possible, I say it because for me it is a fact and I can show it to you verbally, but if you are to find the truth of it for yourself, you must experiment with it and follow it swiftly.
That is a fact and you must put it aside.
So that way there is no escape and to break the background is essential, because to meet the challenge of the new, the mind must be new; to discover God, truth, or what you will, the mind must be fresh, uncontaminated by the past.
To analyse the past, to arrive at conclusions through a series of experiments, to make assertions and denials and all the rest of it, implies, in its very essence, the continuance of the background in different forms; when you see the truth of that fact you will discover that the analyser has come to an end.
The mind is the result of the past, which is the process of conditioning.
That interval is spontaneous, it is not brought about through any causation, through any wish, through any compulsion.
If you watch very carefully, you will see that though the response, the movement of thought, seems so swift, there are gaps, there are intervals between thoughts.
Between two thoughts there is a period of silence which is not related to the thought process.
If you observe you will see that that period of silence, that interval, is not of time and the discovery of that interval, the full experiencing of that interval, liberates you from conditioning—or rather it does not liberate ‘you’ but there is liberation from conditioning.
So the understanding of the process of thinking is meditation.
We are now not only discussing the structure and the process of thought, which is the background of memory, of experience, of knowledge, but we are also trying to find out if the mind can liberate itself from the background.
It is only when the mind is not giving continuity to thought, when it is still with a stillness that is not induced, that is without any causation—it is only then that there can be freedom from the background.
Question: We know sex as an inescapable physical and psychological necessity and it seems to be a root-cause of chaos in the personal life of our generation.
How can we deal with this problem?
We are always thinking from a centre towards the periphery but the periphery is the centre for most of us and so anything we touch is superficial.
Whatever we do on the periphery must inevitably create a problem, and that is our life: we live in the superficial and we are content to live there with all the problems of the superficial.
Problems exist so long as we live in the superficial, on the periphery, the periphery being the ‘me’ and its sensations, which can be externalized or made subjective, which can be identifiedwith the universe, with the country or with some other thing made up by the mind.
So long as we live within the field of the mind there must be complications, there must be problems; that is all we know.
Mind is sensation, mind is the result of accumulated sensations and reactions and anything it touches is bound to create misery, confusion, an endless problem.
The mind is the real cause of our problems, the mind that is working mechanically night and day, consciously and unconsciously.
The mind is a most superficial thing and we have spent generations, we spend our whole lives, cultivating the mind, making it more and more clever, more and more subtle, more and more cunning, more and more dishonest and crooked, all of which is apparent in every activity of our life.
The very nature of our mind is to be dishonest, crooked, incapable of facing facts, and that is the thing which creates problems; that is the thing which is the problem itself.
The sexual act is no problem to you, any more than eating is a problem to you, but if you think about eating or anything else all day long because you have nothing else to think about, it becomes a problem to you.
For the time being, at least for that moment, you can forget yourself—and there is no other way of forgetting yourself.
Everything else you do in life gives emphasis to the ‘me’, to the self.
Every other issue you touch becomes a nightmare, a source of suffering and pain, so you cling to the one thing which gives complete self-forgetfulness, which you call happiness.
But when you cling to it, it too becomes a nightmare, because then you want to be free from it, you do not want to be a slave to it.
So you invent, again from the mind, the idea of chastity, of celibacy, and you try to be celibate, to be chaste, through suppression, all of which are operations of the mind to cut itself off from the fact.
Sex becomes an extraordinarily difficult and complex problem so long as you do not understand the mind which thinks about the problem.
The act itself can never be a problem but the thought about the act creates the problem.
The act you safeguard; you live loosely, or indulge yourself in marriage, thereby making your wife into a prostitute which is all apparently very respectable, and you are satisfied to leave it at that.
Surely the problem can be solved only when you understand the whole process and structure of the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’: my wife, my child, my property, my car, my achievement, my success; until you understand and resolve all that, sex as a problem will remain.
You are creating, feeding, expanding yourself on the one hand, and on the other you are trying to forget yourself, to lose yourself if only for a moment.
Sex is not a problem; the problem is this contradiction in your life; and the contradiction cannot be bridged over by the mind, because the mind itself is a contradiction.
The contradiction can be understood only when you understand fully the whole process of your daily existence.
Going to the cinemas and watching women on the screen, reading books which stimulate the thought, the magazines with their half-naked pictures, your way of looking at women, the surreptitious eyes that catch yours—all these things are encouraging the mind through devious ways to emphasize the self and at the same time you try to be kind, loving, tender.
The two cannot go together.
The man who is ambitious, spiritually or otherwise, can never be without a problem, because problems cease only when the self is forgotten, when the ‘me’ is non-existent, and that state of the non-existence of the self is not an act of will, it is not a mere reaction.
Sex becomes a reaction; when the mind tries to solve the problem, it only makes the problem more confused, more troublesome, more painful.
The act is not the problem but the mind is the problem, the mind which says it must be chaste.
Chastity is not of the mind.
The mind can only suppress its own activities and suppression is not chastity.
Chastity is not a virtue, chastity cannot be cultivated.
The man who is cultivating humility is surely not a humble man; he may call his pride humility, but he is a proud man, and that is why he seeks to become humble.
Pride can never become humble and chastity is not a thing of the mind—you cannot become chaste.
You will know chastity only when there is love, and love is not of the mind nor a thing of the mind.
Therefore the problem of sex which tortures so many people all over the world cannot be resolved till the mind is understood.
We cannot put an end to thinking but thought comes to an end when the thinker ceases and the thinker ceases only when there is an understanding of the whole process.
Fear comes into being when there is division between the thinker and his thought; when there is no thinker, then only is there no conflict in thought.
What is implicit needs no effort to understand.
The thinker comes into being through thought; then the thinker exerts himself to shape, to control his thoughts or to put an end to them.
The thinker is a fictitious entity, an illusion of the mind.
When there is a realization of thought as a fact, then there is no need to think about the fact.
If there is simple, choiceless awareness, then that which is implicit in the fact begins to reveal itself.
Therefore thought as fact ends.
Then you will see that the problems which are eating at our hearts and minds, the problems of our social structure, can be resolved.
Then sex is no longer a problem, it has its proper place, it is neither an impure thing nor a pure thing.
Sex has its place; but when the mind gives it the predominant place, then it becomes a problem.
The mind gives sex a predominant place because it cannot live without some happiness and so sex becomes a problem; when the mind understands its whole process and so comes to an end, that is when thinking ceases, then there is creation and it is that creation which makes us happy.
To be in that state of creation is bliss, because it is self-forgetfulness in which there is no reaction as from the self.
This is not an abstract answer to the daily problem of sex—it is the only answer.
The mind denies love and without love there is no chastity; it is because there is no love that you make sex into a problem.
