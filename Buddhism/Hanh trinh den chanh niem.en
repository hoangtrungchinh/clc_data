Writing an autobiography might seem like an inappropriate exercise for a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk, since we bhikkhus strive to eradicate the ego, not glorify it.
Through meditation and mindfulness we want to let go of attachments and practice selflessness.
Why then would I write a whole book about me?
The idea, oddly enough, came from my meditation retreats.
Whenever I teach a retreat, I invite attendees to write questions on slips of paper and put them in a box.
Each evening, after my formal Dhamma talk, a lecture about the essence of the Buddha’s teachings, I pull a few of the slips out of the box, one by one, and answer whatever question is there.
Usually people want to know about meditation: how to keep up the momentum they’ve built at the retreat; what to do when they are so agitated they can’t sit still; how to practice if they don’t have a good teacher nearby.
Sometimes, though, someone asks a question about my life:
“How long have you been a monk?”
“What was it like, growing up in Sri Lanka?”
“How do you maintain monastic discipline in this world full of temptations?”
When I answer those kinds of questions, I tend to ramble.
I tell stories about my life and people seem to enjoy them.
The meditation hall, usually a silent place, fills with laughter.
Often the students say, “Bhante, you should write your autobiography!”
I’ve read a few life stories of spiritual men and women, and in them, it always seems like miraculous, wondrous things happen to the main character.
Sometimes, the main character may even be the one performing miracles.
Reading these amazing stories, one might conclude that spiritual people are somehow very different from regular people.
As for me, I can claim no miracles.
I have been a simple person all my life.
Early on I learned that if I worked hard, I would usually get good results — nothing supernatural about that.
In many ways my life is probably much like yours.
And so I was hesitant to write the book my students were suggesting.
I worried that it would appear to be an exercise in ego. I was afraid people might think I had grown vain and self-absorbed in my old age.
“Not necessarily,” a friend told me.
“You might be able to do some teaching by telling your own story.” I thought about that.
I thought about my life and realized that, yes, this might indeed be an opportunity to show how the Buddha’s teachings can be an extraordinary guide, leading a simple person like myself to a life of great happiness, great fulfillment.
As a monk, I have dedicated my life to protecting and maintaining the Buddha’s teachings.
I have found that because of that, the Dhamma has protected and maintained me as well.
That’s what I have learned in my seventy-five years.
And that’s the essence of what I want to share with you in all these rambling stories about my life.
For example, I can say sincerely that whenever I was arrogant in my life, I suffered a great deal.
As a young man in monks’ college, I spied on other students, I gossiped, I was always looking for others’ faults.
And because of that, I was miserable.
In fact, I’d say that has always been my greatest weakness: finding fault in others.
Rising above that defilement even a little bit took many long years, through much trial and error, and even now I occasionally struggle with it.
But more or less, I’m happy to say, I can now pretty much accept people as they are.
And my life is so much smoother as a result.
By relying on the Buddha’s teachings, I have learned slowly to withdraw from conflict rather than charging into it or, worse still, going looking for it.
That, too, has made life immeasurably more peaceful.
With the help of the Buddha’s teachings and the practice of mindfulness, the greatest change I have made in myself, I think, is that I can easily forgive people now, no matter what they do, and believe me, this skill didn’t come easily! I had to work long and hard at it.
But my own anger, contentiousness, and judgmentalness were fertile ground for practice.
Just because a person becomes a monk, by no means is he immediately free from all defilements of character or empty of worldly concerns.
As you will see over and over in this book, even in the supposedly noble world of spiritual work, I encountered — in myself and in others — petty jealousies, backstabbing, indifference, and cruelty.
When I reminisce now, I can see that all those things that seemed so awful at the time have ultimately led to positive outcomes.
All the people and situations that I thought were painful were also teachers pushing me in the direction I was supposed to go, pointing out what I needed to learn to become happy.
In retrospect, I am grateful for the mysterious chain of causes and effects that unfolded in my life, even though many of them felt awful and unlucky at the time.
If my father had not been such a strict disciplinarian, I might not have left home to become a monk.
If my teachers hadn’t punished me so severely, I wouldn’t have gone off to missionary school.
If I hadn’t lost my memory and needed a “cure,” I might never have taken an interest in meditation.
If I hadn’t fallen sick working with the Untouchables of India, I wouldn’t have left to go to Malaysia.
If my visa had been extended in Malaysia, I probably would never have ventured to America.
And if things hadn’t fallen apart so bitterly at the Washington Buddhist Vihara, I might not have started Bhavana Society.
But this has been my life, and I am grateful for all of it.
Even so, it pained me to write about some of these things, to dredge up the memories of old hurts and conflicts.
Several times I nearly lost my nerve and withdrew from the plans for this book.
In my periods of doubt, I kept remembering the words of Mark Twain: “Only dead men tell the truth.”
I thought about the sometimes ugly truths of my life, and I worried.
If I wrote about them honestly, I would be displaying my weaknesses, my shortcomings.
But hiding the truth — well, that didn’t feel right either.
And furthermore, it seemed so un-monk-like to write about unpleasant conversations and situations that happened decades ago, to reveal people who were unkind to me, especially when many of them aren’t around anymore to defend themselves.
Adding to my worries was the fact that my native culture does not prize open discussion of conflict.
When my Sinhalese nephews read an early draft of this manuscript, they were aghast.
“You can’t talk about people this way,” they said.
“Why do you want to rehash these old problems? It can only cause trouble.”
People in Sri Lanka don’t want to hear about a monk’s mistakes or character flaws.
They prefer to think of him as an exalted holy man to whom they can bow down in reverence.
In the spiritual economy of Asian Buddhist monastics and laypeople, honoring a venerable bhikkhu by giving him gifts or supporting him brings spiritual merit.
To find out that he is anything less than worthy would disturb a layperson’s sense of order.
But in Western culture, the truth is highly prized.
So I couldn’t tell my life story and leave out the bad parts; that would be a “sanitized” version and would perhaps be perceived as dishonest.
And if I portrayed myself as never having struggled with difficulties and shortcomings, my story certainly wouldn’t help anyone see the value of the Dhamma in dealing with life’s slings and arrows.
The first of the Buddha’s noble truths is that life contains suffering.
We cannot avoid suffering.
Our only option is to work at overcoming the defilements within ourselves that cause suffering: greed, anger, and delusion.
Overcoming these defilements is a lifelong task, as I hope the story of my simple life, my own journey to mindfulness, will show.
But I also hope my story will illustrate that, no matter how strong they may be, the sources of suffering can be overcome in your life, too!
But I also hope my story will illustrate that, no matter how strong they may be, the sources of suffering can be overcome in your life, too!
CHAPTER ONE. Small Treasure
I WAS BORN on the seventh of December 1927, in Henepola, Ceylon.
Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, is a teardrop-shaped island off the southeast coast of India.
It is a beautiful place of lushly forested mountains, rice paddies, and farms of rubber plants and tea trees.
In the late 1920s, the tiny village of Henepola was home to about forty families.
The village was not accessible by road, and it had no school, police station, post office, shops, or restaurants.
It consisted entirely of a cluster of huts and the nearby Buddhist temple, our only public gathering place.
No one in Henepola had electricity or running water, but there was a small river that ran through our village.
The nearest large town was a three-mile walk on a narrow dirt path that wound through groves of coconut trees and tea estates, and the nearest other village was a half mile away.
People from my country have only to hear my ordained name, Henepola Gunaratana, to know where I was born.
The Sinhalese custom is for a monk to receive a new name at ordination: The surname has spiritual meaning, and the first name is that of his birthplace.
When I was a boy, Ceylon was a British colony valued for its spices, tea, rubber, and precious gems, as well as for its strategic location on the silk trading route between Europe and China.
Most of the country’s 1.5 million people were farmers, and my family was no exception.
We grew rice, coconuts, coffee, and other crops on small plots of land, sometimes our own, sometimes rented from British estates.
Nearly everyone in our village was poor, desperately poor.
But our Theravada Buddhist belief system gave us unshakable confidence in life.
According to kamma, the law of cause and effect, current circumstances are the result of past actions.
More importantly, future circumstances will be the result of our current actions.
Therefore, we believed it was best to try hard and carry on, regardless of the difficulties in our lives.
Buddhism, in fact, permeates my earliest memories.
Our entire village’s anchor was the temple.
People went there to visit the monks and ask them to chant suttas, or Buddhist discourses, for nearly every event: weddings, birthdays, serious illnesses, and deaths.
The monks served as teachers, preachers, and advisors, sometimes even as physicians.
People also enjoyed simply chatting with the monks at any hour of day or night.
The temple was always open.
Four times a month — on the full moon, the new moon, and each quarter moon — people typically spent a twenty-four-hour period at the temple.
It was rather freeform.
Some people sat down to meditate; others did walking meditation or stood near the sacred Bodhi tree, reciting scriptures.
Monks and laypeople took turns delivering sermons in the preaching hall, where people sat or reclined on the cool concrete floor.
I remember as a child, I’d doze off in my mother’s lap during those sermons.
My mother’s name was Herat Mudiyanselage Lokumenike.
Her first and middle names mean “person of the highest class,” and her last name means “large gem.”
In Ceylon at that time, women kept their maiden names when they married.
My father’s name was Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Puncibanda.
Translated roughly, his first and middle names mean “a person of high class,” and his last name means “treasure.”
It was simply coincidence that my mother’s middle name, which she inherited from her father, was the same middle name as her husband’s.
I was the second youngest of seven children.
My mother was thirty-seven when she gave birth to me, and I had two older brothers and three older sisters.
One of those sisters was so much older that she had married and left home before I was even born.
Two girls were born after me, but one died as an infant.
My birth was attended by a midwife, who received a measure of rice and a coconut for her trouble.
I came into this world at home in a dimly lit hut with no windows.
While my mother was in labor, she alternately squatted and lay on a mat made of palm fronds spread over the floor.
As was the custom, the midwife tied a rope to the roof beam; it hung down over my mother’s mat so that she could pull on it as a distraction when the pain became unbearable.
She delivered all eight of her children that way.
Two weeks after my birth, when it looked likely I was hearty enough to survive, my father went to visit the chief of a nearby village.
All births and deaths had to be officially registered with a local chief, but Henepola was too small to have its own chief, so my father walked a half mile to the nearest village, Dehideniya.
There, he told the chief the name he had given his third son: Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Ukkubanda.
Ukku means small and banda means treasure.
It’s a fond name adults use to refer tenderly to a baby.
Often the name, even though it’s used for an infant, would remain into adulthood.
As I got older, though, my parents decided to call me Kudabanda, which means something like “small boy.”
That made sense, I suppose, because I was the last boy in the family.
But I never asked them why they called me that instead of my legal name.
My father built our house himself.
It was maybe thirty by forty feet.
The roof was made of straw, dried fronds from coconut trees, and scraps of tin.
The walls were made of mud, reinforced with strips of bamboo.
Along the front and back of the house were open verandas, with walls that were made of mud on the lower half and a wooden lattice on the upper half.
Compared to many huts in the village, ours was spacious.
It had two rooms.
One was a small, dark kitchen; the other was a storage room for my father’s papers, books, and tools.
The furniture was sparse, and all of it handmade, consisting of a couple of small, crude benches and a chair woven of beech strips.
I remember my father sitting upright in that chair after meals, smoking a cigar or chewing betel nut while he told us stories or gave us lectures.
My mother sat on a bench, never in Father’s chair.
We children sat on the floor.
The floor was made of mud, like the walls, but every so often my mother and sisters smeared fresh cow dung over it, using their bare hands.
Manure was considered a germicide, its odor the smell of freshness.
We walked on that floor every day, barefoot.
There were only two beds, each a crude wooden platform topped by a cloth sack stuffed with dried coconut husks.
Those “mattresses” were only a little softer than a pile of rocks.
My oldest brother, Tikiribanda, slept in one bed, which was on the veranda at the front of our hut.
My other brother and I slept near him, on the bare floor.
The other bed, on the back veranda, was my father’s.
Never once did I see my mother lying in that bed with him; she slept with my sisters on the floor.
I never saw my parents kiss or hug or even have a private conversation.
Our parents did, however, share a deep devotion to Buddhism.
Every morning we children woke up to the singsong chant of them reading Pali suttas.
These daily recitations served as our lullaby at night, too.
Before we even learned the alphabet, we could recite Pali devotional stanzas from memory, and we knew what the words kamma and rebirth meant.
Day after day my parents went about their routines without grumbling.
Every morning my father went off to work in the rice paddy, or on our small rubber estate.
My mother stayed home and took care of the house and us children.
When my father came home, she would have a meal ready for him.
Both of my parents knew how to read and write in Sinhalese, which was a rarity in our village and in most of rural Ceylon.
Because my father was literate, and was known as a man of dignity and strict moral principles, he was the most highly respected man in Henepola.
The other villagers often came to him to settle their disputes.
With his own family, though, my father could be a terror.
Sometimes he would suddenly start fighting with my mother. I never understood why.
And he showed his temper in a violent way.
Punishment for us children was swift and painful, and sometimes he even beat my mother.
When that happened, all of us hid.
We were afraid that if we made a sound, his rage would turn on us.
My mother had no formal education, but she was very intelligent.
She taught herself how to read and write, and she knew a lot about herbal medicine.
Her intuition was powerful.
I was very close to my oldest sister, Dingiriamma.
When I was almost two, she gave birth to her second child, a girl who died a couple of weeks later.
Although I had already started to eat solid food, I still loved to drink milk, but our family had no cow and my mother’s milk flow had long since stopped.
So, for almost a year after her baby died, Dingiriamma took me to her breast and fed me as if I were her own child.
She and her husband lived in a village called Gunadaha, three miles away, and a couple of times a week, she would walk to our house and nurse me.
To this day, I still consider her my second mother.
We were perhaps closer to each other than to all of the other five siblings.
My mother and sisters had the job of gathering firewood for cooking fuel.
In an area forested mostly with palm trees and cocoa plants, wood was scarce.
Often, they had to rip dead branches off rubber trees.
Since we had no electricity, we relied on the dim light of coconut oil lamps.
Sometimes, when we didn’t have enough oil for the lamps, my mother made a torch out of nuts from the kekune tree.
She would remove the hard shell from ten or fifteen nuts, and then impale them on a stick.
The natural oil in the nuts would burn for hours.
Although our village didn’t have running water, our family was lucky because about two hundred yards from the house, we had a private well.
This well was fed by a spring that ran year-round, and although it was only about five feet deep, it was a generous six feet by four feet wide.
We used the water for bathing, drinking, and washing clothes.
My mother and sisters hauled the spring water to the house in large earthen pots, which had round bellies and small mouths.
I remember how water stayed so cool in those pots.
For bathing, we used primitive buckets made of fibrous sheaths shed by areca palm trees. Those sheaths were sometimes five feet long and three feet wide.
We could fold one into a bucket shape and carry two or three gallons of water in it.
No matter how clean we kept our bodies, our clothes, and our mattresses, we all suffered the agony of bed bugs.
I vividly remember scratching the swollen, red places on my body where bed bugs had bitten me.
Although the itching was terrible, I never thought to wish for anything else; it was just a part of life.
We had mosquitoes and flies, too, but those you could combat by burning coconut husks.
Bed bugs, on the other hand, were nearly impossible to get rid of.
They were barely visible, and hid in the coconut husk mattresses.
Even though we often washed those mattresses and dried them in the sun, the bed bugs always came back.
Some people would move their mattresses away from the wall or place little tin cans of oil under each leg of their bed, but the bed bugs were determined.
If they couldn’t climb up the legs of the bed, they crawled up the wall and dropped down from the ceiling like tiny kamikaze pilots.
Leeches were another problem.
Whenever my brother and I went exploring, we’d come home with leeches clinging to our legs or burrowed between our toes.
We would pull them off, but often their minute teeth stayed imbedded in our skin.
A couple of days later, there would be open wounds where the leeches had bitten us.
Sometimes blueflies laid their eggs there.
Those eggs would hatch into maggots, which of course made the wounds worse.
Maybe because I was malnourished, my body didn’t have enough strength to fight the bacteria in those wounds. They would heal slowly, and badly.
I still have scars on my legs.
My father had inherited several acres of land: a one-acre rubber estate, a half-acre tea plantation, a one-acre rice field, and the cleared acre on which he built our house.
In addition to farming rice, tea, and rubber, my father also enjoyed gardening.
In the clearing around our house, he planted bougainvillea and hibiscus.
Next to the house, he planted a mixed hedge of jasmine and roses, which he neatly trimmed with a large knife.
He also grew numerous cash crops: sweet potatoes, tapioca, beans, eggplant, okra, bitter gourds, cabbage, and coffee.
However, even with that much food growing nearby, there was still never enough to feed us all.
In addition to our property, we had two water buffalo, which my father used to pull a plow across the rice paddy.
Luckily, we did not have to feed the buffalo produce from our fields and gardens; they ate grass or the thorny, discarded shells of jackfruit.
My father traded his crops for dried fish, spices, sugar, salt, kerosene oil, and other supplies we couldn’t grow or make ourselves.
To do his trading, he walked three miles to a town called Galagedara, where there were some shops run by Muslims and Hindu Tamils.
Often he couldn’t find what he wanted; everything seemed to be in short supply.
To help support his seven hungry children, my father also did carpentry work for our neighbors.
Unfortunately, people could rarely afford to pay him.
Maybe it was the constant financial worries that made him so cross.
He was a severe disciplinarian.
He kept a stick hidden on the roof of the house and used it quickly and forcefully to punish us for any slight wrongdoing.
His shout was so frightening that we would tremble when we heard it.
My brother Rambanda and I knew that sound, and the stick, well. We were quite mischievous.
One of our earliest pranks was throwing stones at cows and birds.
One day we saw a dog with puppies.
My brother picked up a handful of stones and told me to climb a nearby tree.
His plan was to harass the dog while we were safely ensconced in the tree.
I told Rambanda the tree was too high to climb, that I was too small.
“Please don’t,” I begged.
“She’ll bite me.”
But he was intent.
He swung himself up into the tree, then started pelting the dog with stones.
I ran as fast as I could, but the dog was faster.
I fell down and she bit me.
When my brother and I got home, we had to explain why I was bleeding.
My father beat both of us for being cruel to the dog.
Rambanda and I always seemed to be hungry.
Edible fruits or nuts we found while playing were great treats.
If they were growing on someone’s property, we’d ask the property owner’s permission.
If they said no, we took the fruits anyway.
One day my brother and I were on our way to our family’s rubber estate.
Halfway there, we passed a small field belonging to a poorer family.
There were about fifty corn plants growing in that field.
One plant near the road had a ripe ear of corn hanging on it.
My brother looked around and saw no one, so he picked the ear and broke it in half.
One piece for him, one for me: delicious!
On our way home, we passed the cornfield again.
This time, for some reason, we decided to be honest.
My brother went to the owner’s house and asked her for an ear of corn.
The woman said there was one just next to the road, and we were welcome to it.
She came out into the field to show us where it was, but when we reached the corn stalks by the road, the woman saw that the ear she intended to give us was gone.
Then she noticed a small footprint in the mud.
She asked my brother to place his foot in the footprint.
He did, and it was a perfect fit.
We were obviously guilty, but the woman didn’t appear angry.
She said, “You boys go home.
I’ll bring you some more corn.”
We started off happily toward home.
When we reached our house, however, the woman was already there.
She had told our father the whole story and he was waiting for us, stick in hand, angrier than I had ever seen him.
This was a doubly bad deed.
Not only had we broken the Buddhist precept against stealing, but we also had stolen from a lower-caste family who had very little.
Father thrashed us until our backs began to bleed.
My mother tried to stop him, but he kept beating us.
Even the woman, the victim of our crime, begged him to stop.
Everyone was crying, but our father would listen to no one.
He beat us until he was too tired to beat us anymore.
This, of course, would be labeled child abuse today.
But seventy years ago in Ceylon, it was standard practice for parents to punish children by thrashing them.
As a devout Buddhist, my father was determined to teach us the difference between right and wrong, and his methods were simply those of his generation and culture.
Truly, I can’t fault him for that.
As a child, I wore a long shirt of rough cotton. It was blue and red plaid, and came down to my knees.
That was the uniform for young boys and girls.
When I was eleven, I began to wear two pieces of clothing: a regular shirt and a skirtlike sarong.
Throughout my childhood, I never wore shoes or even sandals; they were too expensive.
We children had to be careful with our clothes because we only got new outfits at New Year’s, which Ceylonese celebrated in mid-April.
My siblings and I also had no toys.
We played with sticks, dry palm fronds, coconut shells, and frayed pieces of discarded rope.
Our playground was the sand in front of our house, the rice fields, or the threshing grounds where farmers separated rice from its stalks.
I also loved to climb trees and explore the forest.
One time I was out exploring and discovered an old woodshed in the forest.
I found some rope and slung it over one of the beams in the shed, to make a swing.
It was great fun for about thirty seconds.
As soon as I started swinging, the beam cracked, broke in two, and fell on top of my head.
Everything felt numb for a moment, then warm liquid began to pour down my forehead and over my face.
I stumbled outside and found an areca palm sheath on the ground.
I pressed it to my head, thinking I somehow had to collect all that blood.
My mother, who seemed to have a sixth sense for knowing when I was in trouble, quickly found me.
She took me home, tenderly washed the wound on my head, and applied one of her herbal ointments.
In the evenings, my brothers, sisters, and I would play hide-and-seek until dinnertime, which was usually around 9 P.M.
As soon as dinner was over, we fell asleep, on the bare floor, without a pillow or blanket.
There was no such thing as brushing our teeth or taking a bath before we went to bed.
To lull us to sleep Mother told beautiful stories, some of them folktales and some Jataka tales, which are stories of the Buddha’s previous lives.
As a child, one of my favorite Jataka stories was about Sasa, the generous rabbit who offered to jump into a fire and sacrifice himself so a hungry old man could have something to eat.
I think I liked that story because I used to gaze at the full moon and would see in its craters and valleys what looked like a rabbit.
I dreamed of being generous enough to reach the moon, where I could sit beside that rabbit and look down on the earth.
My parents always told me the Buddha was soft and gentle like moonlight, shining his brilliance on everyone without discrimination.
So when I thought of the moon, I thought of the rabbit in the moon, of Sasa the generous rabbit, and of the Buddha — all three were interwoven in my mind.
It’s ironic that I liked the story of a self-sacrificing rabbit, because I myself was actually very greedy, especially about food.
I was always on guard over my food, lest someone grab my meal away from me.
If someone even looked at my plate, I would get angry and throw it on the ground.
That was completely foolish, of course, because food was too precious to waste.
But I had a flash temper, perhaps like my father, and I didn’t control it any better than he did.
Sometimes my brothers and sisters stared at my food just to set me off.
Once, when that happened, I flew into such a rage I threw my plate of food out the door.
Father gave me a beating, then made me go and pick up the plate, and of course I didn’t get any more food that meal.
One day, my third sister, who was four years older than I, took a wooden stick and drew a pumpkin in the sand.
I took another stick and scratched it out.
She was so upset that she hit me with a broom.
I grabbed a wooden bench and chased her into the house, then I threw the bench at her.
It hit her big toe and ripped the nail completely off.
There was a lot of blood and immediately she started wailing.
When my mother heard her, she rushed in to help and I ran outside.
That was the first time I remember doing something mean to one of my siblings.
I was seven or eight years old.
Luckily, my father was not home when it happened, and neither my mother nor my sister told him exactly what happened.
I guess they feared my father’s wrath as much as I did.
They simply let him believe my sister’s bandaged toe was the result of an accident.
When I was growing up, there were no cars or even bicycles in our village; walking was the only mode of transportation.
To get to a main road, we either had to walk two miles down a steep hill in one direction or three miles along a flat road in the other direction.
When people were seriously ill and unable to walk, they were tied into a chair or onto a board and carried three miles to the nearest hospital, in Galagedara.
In 1933, when I was five, a malaria epidemic swept Ceylon.
My whole family was sick, off and on, for three years.
The British government distributed quinine, as well as free rice and other food staples, because no one was strong enough to work.
However, there was a catch: We had to walk three miles each week to get our allotment.
We took turns making the trip; whoever was least sick would go.
I remember walking those three miles with a terrible fever, just to get the food and medicine.
I recall two other medical emergencies.
When I was about eight or nine I abruptly lost my night vision, probably because of malnutrition.
After dark, it was as if I were blind.
I couldn’t see anything at all, even with the light from a kerosene lamp.
My brothers and sisters teased me about it, saying I was pretending, but my mother was very concerned.
She consulted the village medicine man, who gave her a bitter-tasting potion for me.
It was made from an herb, but he wouldn’t tell her its name.
Many people believed herbal medicines had mystical powers, and their components were often kept secret.
My mother was supposed to grind the herb into a paste and feed it to me every day until my eyesight improved.
The paste tasted wretched, and to make matters worse, I was supposed to take this foul concoction early in the morning, when my stomach was empty.
To get me to take that medicine, my mother used the power of love.
Before anyone else in the house was awake, she would take me onto her lap.
She would hug me, kiss me, and tell me stories in a low whisper.
After a few minutes, I was so relaxed and happy that I would have done anything she asked.
That was the moment she would put the medicine in my mouth and tell me to swallow it quickly.
She always mixed the bitter paste with sugar, though it still tasted awful.
But after several months of that daily ritual, I completely recovered my eyesight.
Now, many years later, I understand the power of metta, or loving-friendliness.
In a way, it helps us swallow the bitterness of life.
It smooths over the rough moments, the disappointments, the hurt.
The Buddha used the power of metta to “conquer” many of his enemies.
He even instructed monks living in the forest to use metta when confronted by poisonous snakes.
And the Metta Sutta is one of the most beautiful of his discourses.
It is a very short sutta, but one that Buddhist monks usually chant at every formal gathering.
It describes a way of thinking and acting that can bring peace to the practitioner and to those around him or her.
The Buddha told his disciples that the practice of metta is a meritorious deed.
Therefore, while cultivating thoughts of loving-friendliness, we are happy, feeling the kind of deep happiness that comes from performing a meritorious deed.
It’s a sense of peace.
Whenever I teach people how to formally practice loving-friendliness, I give them the following phrases to repeat:
May you be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to you.
May no difficulties come to you.
May no problems come to you.
May you always meet with success.
May you also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.
The first person to whom we direct thoughts of metta is ourself: “May I be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to me.
May no difficulties come to me… ”
Why start with yourself? some people ask.
Isn’t that terribly selfish? To love yourself before anyone else?
Not necessarily.
It is easiest to summon up metta for ourselves because, among all beings on earth, we love ourselves best.
 So we can quickly generate those warm feelings of loving-friendliness for ourselves.
We can saturate ourselves in it, fill our bodies and minds with it.
Then, as the goodwill spreads through our being, it naturally spills out.
We have surplus to share.
And we do, with the next most logical group of people: those near and dear to us.
Spouses, life partners, children, parents, brothers, sisters, other relatives, close friends, perhaps a spiritual mentor.
We picture them in our mind’s eye and we repeat the phrases, with those cherished ones as the recipients of our metta.
The next group is the largest.
It includes all those beings we encounter every day, but aren’t as close to.
The passing ¬acquaintances — sometimes complete strangers — who move in and out of our lives.
Classmates, coworkers, neighbors, the checkout clerk at the grocery store, the person sitting in the car next to you at a stoplight, a friendly dog with a wagging tail, someone who whizzes by you on a bike trail.
We extend loving-friendliness to all these beings, human and nonhuman, and wish them well.
The last group is probably — hopefully! — a small one.
It consists of your adversaries, those difficult people who pop up in your life to provide what we might politely call “challenges.”
This is where metta practice becomes sticky for many people.
Wish your enemies well? Hope for their success, when they’re going after the same promotion you want? Send them peaceful thoughts when they’ve just insulted your child or cut in front of you in traffic?
Yes, said the Buddha.
And here’s why: If we wish that person well, and hope that he has success, maybe he will develop spiritually.
That’s the kind of success we’re wishing for him — spiritual success.
And if he evolves spiritually, he probably won’t be our adversary anymore.
There won’t be any need for that.
He’ll be more peaceful; his noble qualities will emerge.
We’ll all be able to coexist more harmoniously.
But the practice of loving-friendliness shouldn’t be confined to formal repetition of the phrases.
We should cultivate metta in our thoughts, words, and deeds, the Buddha said.
Every step, every action, every reflection should be one of metta.
Whatever a person repeats again and again will become his or her own mental state.
If you practice metta constantly, you yourself will be full of metta.
It will become your nature.
And you’ll realize that others have this soft, gentle nature buried within them, too.
My mother understood and lived the words of the Buddha.
She made sure all her children heard stories of the Buddha’s life and learned about his compassion and wisdom.
She herself was a walking example of metta, always treating anyone she met with gentleness and soft words.
In many ways, I considered her almost a holy person.
About a year after my mysterious bout of night blindness, my mother had an accident that changed her life.
One day she climbed a cocoa tree to pick some cocoa fruit, something she did often.
She would cut open the fruit, take out the fleshy seeds , and dry them in the sun.
Father would take them to market and sell them for about five cents a pound.
Dried cocoa seeds were a great delicacy because they could be pounded into cocoa powder.
That day, my mother’s routine turned to tragedy.
When she was high in the tree, a branch gave way under her and she fell.
I heard her cry out, and when I ran over, I found her lying on her back on the ground, unconscious.
Two of my sisters came, as well, and when they saw her, they started crying.
Apparently the neighbors heard my sisters crying and they tried their best to help.
When Mother woke up, one of the neighbors offered her a folk tonic: a drink of brandy with an egg yolk stirred into it.
She refused to drink it.
All her life she had followed the Buddhist precepts, which include a dictum against alcohol.
She didn’t want to break the precept, even if the brandy would dull her pain.
Someone ran to alert my father, who was working in the rice paddy.
My father, in turn, ran to fetch the village medicine man.
Several people helped carry my mother to our house; her back was hurting so much she couldn’t walk.
The medicine man sent people in several directions to collect the leaves and roots of particular herbs.
When they returned, he ground the herbs into a paste and rubbed it on my mother’s back.
He left us with a supply of the paste, and told us to reapply it twice a day.
Every Ceylonese village had both a Buddhist monk and a medicine man, and the two worked cooperatively.
Before preparing any of his herbal medicines, the medicine man would chant Buddhist stanzas in front of his home altar.
He didn’t charge anything for his services, but people routinely gave him gifts of vegetables, coconuts, spices, tea, or betel nut.
It was believed that if the medicine man was a good Buddhist, his potions would have more power.
Therefore, his healing power depended on his purity as a Buddhist.
Even after the British set up a system of local government with a chief in charge of each village, the medicine man and head monk still had the greatest authority.
The chief always consulted with the head monk and the medicine man before making decisions about how to punish a criminal or settle a dispute.
Several days after her fall, my mother was no better.
She couldn’t move her legs or stand up; all she could do was moan in pain.
She barely ate or drank anything except for a little rice soup and some orange juice.
It was obvious she needed more medical care, but my parents didn’t trust hospitals.
My mother said she wanted to go to her parents’ house, about thirty miles from our village.
That was a long journey, but the medicine man in her parents’ village was supposed to be powerful, and my mother said she would be more comfortable in her childhood home.
So Father and a few other men eased her onto a board and carried her to the nearest town.
There, my father hired a car and took her to her parents’ house.
During their trip, we children were left alone.
My second oldest sister was eighteen by then, so she did the cooking and looked after us younger ones.
After a few days, my father returned without my mother.
She had remained at her parents’ house to recuperate.
But she never recovered entirely.
When she finally came home several months later, she was hunchbacked and on crutches.
Her right leg wouldn’t bend at all, and she couldn’t even walk the short distance to the temple.
At age seven, I started school.
The nearest one was in Medagama, about a half mile from our house, and was run by Catholic missionary nuns.
I loved it, mainly because of the delicious lunches we were served each day.
Before eating, we had to say Catholic prayers, our heads bowed over the little food trays placed on our desks.
I closed my eyes and mumbled the words, but my mind was on the tantalizing aromas wafting up to my nose.
I attended the Catholic school for about a year before the Buddhist temple in Dehideniya opened a primary school.
All the children of Henepola, perhaps thirty or forty of us, switched schools.
The first year at the Buddhist school was pretty cramped.
The temple’s preaching hall, an open-air structure, served as the only classroom, and it was always noisy because there were so many of us in one room.
A year later, the government granted a small plot of land next to the temple for a separate school building.
The villagers worked together to build a simple rectangular, one-room building, which was about one hundred feet by thirty feet.
It had five-foot-high walls with only bare openings instead of windows or doors, and the roof was made of coconut palm fronds.
This new building had long tables and hard wooden benches.
During our first year in the new school building, we used slates and slender stone slabs for writing our lessons.
By the second year, however, the government provided pencils and paper exercise books, a real luxury!
Every morning when the teacher walked in, we stood next to our benches and bowed, hands folded in front of our chests.
“Good morning, sir,” we chorused, as he greeted us with a similar bow.
Then it was inspection time.
The teacher walked along the rows of students and looked at our teeth and fingernails to make sure they were clean. Everything had to be neat, including our clothes.
If something wasn’t, we got a thrashing with his long cane.
In fact, if we did anything wrong at all, our backsides met that cane.
And sometimes the teacher used his knuckles to rap our skulls.
It didn’t occur to anyone that this was cruel, or anything other than usual.
Before lessons began, in Pali we all recited the three refuges — ¬refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha — and the five precepts of Buddhism.
Even the youngest children knew these recitations by heart, because everyone had heard their parents chanting them at home every single day of their lives.
The school curriculum included Sinhalese grammar, history, science, arithmetic, and of course, Buddhism.
Every day, on the way to and from school, I walked past a small, swift-flowing creek.
Neither my brother nor I could swim, and my mother was petrified that we would drown in that creek.
Every day she would stand in the doorway of our house and wait for us to come home from school.
She knew what a magnet the creek was for adventurous kids, how my brother and I longed to throw down our schoolbooks, tear off our sarongs, and jump in the cool water.
And some days, we did just that! My mother, ever vigilant, would scream at the top of her lungs as soon as we set foot in the water, and we would reluctantly climb out.
Once, though, we got away with it.
We jumped in the water and Mother didn’t see us.
Almost immediately, I was trapped in a small whirlpool where the stream flowed under a stand of bamboo.
I flailed my arms and tried to stay afloat, but the eddy was pulling me down with a terrifying force.
Somehow my brother managed to grab hold of me and pull me out.
He saved my life.
That would not be my last experience of near-drowning.
To this day, even though I have traveled all over the world and crossed oceans countless times, I am still uncomfortable around large bodies of water.
One day, when I was perhaps nine years old, I was coming home from school with several other boys during a heavy rainstorm.
We had to cross a rice field, which had narrow dividers between the rows of rice plants, with irrigation ditches bisecting the dividers.
We came to one particular ditch swollen by the monsoon rains.
It was like a small river, with a swift current.
All the other boys jumped over the ditch, but I hesitated, holding my schoolbooks against my chest.
Finally, as I was working up my courage to jump, I slipped on the edge of the bank and fell into the water.
My books and slate were immediately carried away by the current as I struggled to keep my head above water.
The harder I tried to swim, the faster I seemed to sink.
My brother, Rambanda, jumped into the water and pulled me out.
I was scared and wet, but all right.
We never told our parents about it.
We knew what would happen if we did.
The Buddhist temple, which was about a quarter-mile from our house, was the center of our village.
Only one monk and his assistant, a layman, lived there.
The compound included a preaching hall, a shrine room, a little mud hut that served as a kitchen, and an outhouse.
In a corner of the courtyard stood a Bodhi tree, to remind us of the tree that Shakyamuni Buddha sat under when he attained enlightenment.
A brick wall surrounded the tree, to keep children from climbing its sacred limbs.
The temple was maintained by a board of directors and a willing force of volunteer labor.
People from the village cheerfully helped with construction, cleaning, cooking, and organizing celebrations.
Buddhists believe that such good works earn merit in this life and the next.
Most people went to the temple nearly every day, even if only for a short visit.
The daily rhythms of the temple also regulated our daily lives.
Every day at 6 A.M., either the monk or his assistant would ring a large, gong-like bell in the temple courtyard.
That was the signal for morning devotions.
It meant the monk had completed his hour-long meditation and now was going to the shrine room to chant devotional prayers.
Everyone in the village could hear that bell.
When it rang, we knew it was time for our individual rituals, too.
We would put fresh flowers on our home altars, light incense, and settle down to chant.
The temple bell would ring again at 11 A.M., when the monk was beginning to eat his main meal of the day.
That bell was our only way of marking time, as no one had clocks or wristwatches.
Every evening, Rambanda and I went to the temple.
We loved it there.
The monk let us play on the temple grounds and often gave us candy or leftover food.
We were not supposed to eat temple food, because it had been offered by villagers for the monk’s consumption.
Our parents had told us that eating temple food would cause bad kamma for us, that we’d be dragged into hell by that kamma.
But the monk was so friendly, and our hunger so strong, that we forgot about hell.
We eagerly ate whatever he gave us: boiled rice, spicy fish, cooked lentils, rice-flour sweets, maybe a ripe mango.
My father built the temple’s preaching hall, a thirty-by-thirty-foot building with a cement floor, brick walls, and a tile roof.
Inside was a square platform about six inches high, with four tall wooden pillars at its corners.
The only thing on the platform was a chair, surrounded by a wooden lattice and covered with a cloth canopy that was draped over the pillars.
On full-moon and new-moon days, laypeople spent the whole day and night at the temple.
Monks from neighboring villages would also come to our temple and take turns sitting on that throne and delivering sermons.
First thing in the morning, a monk would recite one of the Buddha’s discourses in Pali.
Because Pali is similar to Sinhalese, most of the laypeople could understand what he was saying.
The morning recital was short, usually only an hour, because the monks also had to perform a devotional service before their lunch, which was at 11 A.M.
In the afternoon, another monk would explain the meaning of the Pali discourse that had been delivered that morning.
Then the temple visitors were free for several hours to meditate, ask the monks questions, or read Dhamma books.
In the evening, a solemn ceremony unfolded.
After all the laypeople assembled in the preaching hall, a learned monk was carried in by two men folding their arms together to make a seat.
There weren’t many of these highly respected monks.
Some of them could recite the entire Pali canon by memory and knew all the commentaries as well.
They were skilled in picking apart a discourse and explaining every point, in marathon sermons that lasted as long as ten hours.
They were usually renowned for their storytelling abilities and their sweet chanting voices.
The monk’s procession was accompanied by drum-beating, conch-blowing, flute-playing, and loud calls of “Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!” which means, “Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!”
The monk was gently lowered into his chair on the platform, then wrapped in a white cloth up to his neck.
A curtain was drawn in front of him, leaving only his face showing.
Other men came forward with tea for the monk, or a tray full of sugarcane candy and a chewing mixture of betel nuts, areca nuts, lime paste, and tobacco.
A spittoon was placed before him.
First the monk took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, the Triple Gem of Buddhism.
His voice was beautifully nasal, his chant hypnotically singsong as it floated out from behind the curtain:
Then the monk would administer the five precepts to the villagers, a traditional beginning for any Buddhist gathering.
He chanted the phrases in Pali, and the laypeople repeated after him.
After those preliminaries, the sermon would begin around 8 P.M.
Sometimes it lasted all night.
Children fell asleep on the floor beside their parents.
The adults, however, were supposed to stay awake.
To help them, an old man with a long white beard sat in front of the platform.
Every time the monk paused to take a breath, the old man said very loudly, “YES, Venerable Sir!”
Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night and find the whole room asleep, save for the monk and that old man.
It amazed me that anyone managed to stay awake.
Around 5 A.M., the drum-beaters began thumping a beat, and people would begin to stir.
By then the monk had moved into the last part of his sermon, explaining how Maitreya, the future Buddha, will appear when the teachings of Gotama, our present Buddha, are no longer in practice.
At 6 A.M., the monk would open the curtain and stretch out his legs, which had been folded in the same position all night.
Several men would approach him, carrying a pan of warm coconut oil.
For fifteen minutes, they’d massage his feet and legs with the oil.
Then the monk would descend from the platform and retire to his room to wash before breakfast.
Watching all this as a young boy, I was deeply impressed.
The laypeople’s pious attitude and respect for the monk was inspiring.
I told my parents that I wanted to become a monk: I wanted to deliver sermons and be carried to my chair by reverent people.
Not only that, but I would teach Dhamma in English, I boasted.
My oldest brother had taught me the English alphabet, as well as a few English words.
Nobody else in our village knew any English at all, even though it was the “official” language of Ceylon under British rule.
We villagers were allowed to use Sinhalese, but English was clearly the language of the elite — those with government jobs, those in high society, those wealthy enough to travel.
So I thought if I could learn English, I would be the ultimate educated monk.
My parents listened to my childish dreams, and they laughed.
CHAPTER TWO. The Homeless Life
AS I GREW OLDER, my interest in becoming a monk intensified.
Before I became a bhikkhu, I loved pretending I was a bhikkhu.
I would wrap a piece of white cloth around myself, the way monks wrap their robes around them, and sit down under a tree in the forest.
I imagined that the other trees around me were people, and I preached to the crowd of silent listeners, reciting a few Pali stanzas I’d heard at the temple.
I would also sit and pretend to be deep in “meditations,” though I had no idea what meditation was.
Even then, I believed it was somehow my kamma to become a monk.
This is not to say that it was my “fate” to be a monk, for Buddhism has no such notions.
Rather, because of all the accumulated causes and conditions in my past, however long that may have been, I now wanted to be a Buddhist monk.
Perhaps I had been a monk in a previous life — not a totally successful one, because I obviously hadn’t achieved enlightenment in that life, but not a complete failure, either, because I had the good fortune to have been reborn as a human being, with another chance to better myself spiritually.
But even putting such notions aside, the impulse to ordain and that deep longing to wear the saffron robe flowered in me very early.
By the time I was eleven years old, I had lost interest in the boyhood mischief and pranks Rambanda and I used to enjoy, but I’d also lost interest in school.
I wanted only to enter the two-and-a-half-millennium-old order of Buddhist monks in the ancient Asian tradition.
Stories of young boys in the time of the Buddha who had had similar aspirations to become monks captivated me.
One such story was about a boy called Culapanthaka.
Culapanthaka was born at the side of a road as his mother traveled to her parents’ home.
In ancient India, it was the custom for a pregnant woman to return to her ancestral home to deliver a baby, and often the rigors of the trip induced labor.
Prince Siddhattha Gotama , who would later become the Buddha, was born in a grove of trees near a roadway because his mother, Queen Mahamaya, was on her way to her parents’ house.
Culapanthaka’s mother had two sons, both of them born in this fashion, by the side of a road.
The first, she named Mahapanthaka — “big traveler.” The second one’s name, Culapanthaka, meant “little traveler.” Because she was extremely poor, she left the boys in the care of her parents in Rajagaha.
Mahapanthaka often accompanied his grandfather to hear the Bud¬dha preach, and that inspired him eventually to become a monk.
Young Culapanthaka followed in his brother’s footsteps several years later.
Mahapanthaka wanted to teach his brother Dhamma, but found him to be a poor student.
Culapanthaka could not memorize one simple stanza even in several months’ time.
Mahapanthaka was very disappointed and thought it was wrong for his brother to continue as a monk if he could not learn Dhamma.
“You should take off your monk’s robe and go home,” he told his younger brother.
Culapanthaka was devastated.
He loved the monk’s life and loved being a disciple of the Buddha.
He didn’t know what to do, but he knew he didn’t want to leave the robe.
Not long after, Jivaka Komarabhacca, who sometimes served as the Buddha’s physician, requested that Mahapanthaka invite the Buddha and all the monks in the monastery to have a noontime meal at his house.
Mahapanthaka accepted the invitation on the monks’ behalf, adding, “By tomorrow, however, Culapanthaka will no longer be at the monastery.
I have asked him to disrobe. But I will come with the Buddha and the rest of the monks.”
Overhearing his brother’s decisive tone, Culapanthaka grieved bitterly, and with tears in his eyes, he packed his few belongings and left the monastery.
But as he was walking out, the Buddha met him and asked him why he seemed so sad. He told the Buddha what had happened.
“Come, come,” said the Buddha. “You don’t have to leave the robe and the monk’s life just because you couldn’t memorize one stanza.
Here, I’ll teach you something that you can learn easily.”
The Buddha gave him a piece of white cloth and said, “Take this cloth and sit in the sun.
Put the cloth in the palm of your left hand, and rub it with your right palm, saying over and over, ‘Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.’”
Culapanthaka did exactly what the Buddha asked him to.
He sat in the sun, rubbing his right hand in circles over the cloth, repeating the unusual mantra the Buddha had given him as an exercise in mind¬fulness.
After a while he looked down.
The white piece of cloth had turned dark, stained by the oils in his hand.
Even though he had been chanting a mantra about cleaning, he had made the cloth dirty!
All of a sudden, Culapanthaka realized that everything is impermanent.
All that he loved, all that he encountered, all that he resisted, everything without exception was as impermanent as that clean white cloth.
At that moment, clearly realizing the impermanence of all things, Culapanthaka became enlightened.
He went to the monastery, sat under a tree and, using the mysterious psychic powers of a fully awakened one, created hundreds of monks exactly like himself.
Meanwhile, the other monks of the monastery had gone with the Buddha to Jivaka’s house.
The Buddha did not see Culapanthaka and thus declined to eat when the lunch was served.
“What is the matter, Venerable Sir?” asked a nervous Jivaka.
“Is something amiss?”
“Are you sure that all the monks in the monastery have come here?” asked the Buddha.
“Yes, Venerable Sir, I am sure they’ve all come.
Venerable Mahapanthaka confirmed that.”
“Nevertheless,” the Buddha said calmly, “send somebody to the monastery and see if any monk was left behind.”
Jivaka sent a man to the monastery.
The man returned very quickly, pale as a ghost.
“Venerable Sir, the entire monastery is full of monks!” he said.
“Some were meditating, some sewing their robes, some cleaning the compound, some fetching water, some walking, some reciting whole discourses on the Dhamma.”
Then the Buddha asked the man to go back to the monastery and ask for Culapanthaka.
He did.
And when he did, all the monks — hundreds of them — said, in one voice, “I am Culapanthaka.”
The man was dumbfounded.
He went back to Jivaka’s house and reported what he had witnessed.
Then the Buddha asked him to go back and catch one of the monks by his robe.
“If you do that,” the Buddha said, “the other monks will disappear.”
That was what the man did.
And he brought the one named Culapanthaka back for lunch.
When they finished eating, the Buddha asked Culapanthaka to deliver a sermon.
His brother, Mahapanthaka, and the rest of the monks were shocked.
Why would the Buddha honor such an inferior person, a no-good monk who couldn’t even memorize so much as a stanza of the teachings?
But Culapanthaka delivered a wonderful Dhamma sermon, taken directly from his own realization of impermanence.
Everyone was astounded by the depth of his intellect.
According to the story, in one of his previous lives he had been a very smart monk, but had laughed at a dull colleague who was trying with difficulty to learn a certain passage by heart.
So in Culapanthaka’s next life, his kamma came to fruition: On the one hand he could not learn one stanza in four months, and on the other hand he was able to attain enlightenment and supernatural powers.
Both were the results of his own previous kamma, good and bad.
A dual-purpose story: both inspiration and warning!
Like Culapanthaka, I was steadfast in pursuit of my goal.
I pestered my parents about becoming a bhikkhu long enough that they gradually began to take my request more seriously, as something more than a passing whim.
I was still too young to ordain fully, but I could live in a temple and train as a novice.
Many young boys did that, and many of those became monks when they were old enough.
It was considered very auspicious for a family if one of its sons entered the order.
When a boy ordained, all his relatives received the benefit of spiritual merit.
Even if a young man had already married when he decided to become a monk, it was no shame for him to leave his wife.
She, too, would acquire merit by her husband’s ordination.
So, with some reluctance, my father finally agreed to let me try temple life.
My mother cried because she hated to see me leave home, but she saw in my determination that it was inevitable — my birth horoscope had even predicted it! And my mother was certainly not the only mother in Ceylon to give her youngest son to the religious life; because Buddhism was so pervasive in our culture, this happened all the time.
My father consulted the village astrologer to determine a lucky day for me to leave home.
In those days, astrology dictated the main events of our lives.
People consulted the stars for deciding when to plant a crop, when to marry, when to cremate the dead, when to cut a child’s hair for the first time, when to start an important job, even when to dig the foundation for a building.
Although astrological principles may seem contrary to the Buddha’s teaching of the kammic law of cause and effect, belief in astrology co-existed nonetheless alongside Buddhist practices, and no one thought this was a problem in the least.
On the chosen day, my mother cooked some milk rice for me.
That was a wonderful treat, made only for very special occasions.
When a child reads his alphabet for the first time, his mother makes milk rice.
When a child goes to school for the first time, his mother makes milk rice.
To celebrate a birthday or the new year, people make milk rice.
The first harvest of rice every year is used to make milk rice that is offered to the monks.
And, of course, it was milk rice that the village girl Sujata offered to an emaciated Siddhattha Gotama, after he decided to give up asceticism.
He accepted the refreshment.
It revived him to the point that he was able to meditate strongly beneath the Bodhi tree and attain enlightenment and then teach about the Middle Way.
While I was eating the milk rice my mother had prepared for my home-leaving day, I saw that tears were beginning to roll down her cheeks and my sisters’.
Rambanda also was trying to keep from crying.
As the time to leave approached, my father appeared, dressed in his best white sarong and shirt.
He told me it was time to get going.
I put on a white sarong and shirt, too.
By then my brother was crying openly, and suddenly it became very hard to leave.
Mixed feelings swirled into a knot in my throat.
I was happy at last to be going to a temple, but I felt very sad to leave my family.
With this departure I was symbolically renouncing home life to take up what is called “the homeless life,” the life of a Buddhist monk.
The family gathered in front of the house to see me off.
I knelt before my mother and touched my forehead to the sand at her feet.
She stroked my head with both of her hands.
“May the Triple Gem protect you,” she murmured, her voice thick and choked.
“May all the gods protect you.
May you live long in good health.
May no harm come to you.”
And then she started sobbing.
I stood up and she kissed my forehead and gave me a strong hug.
My father and I walked many hours along dusty roads to reach the temple that would be my new home.
We had no appointment, and my father had not told the temple I was coming.
The stars said it was an auspicious day for my home-leaving, and that was that.
Late in the day we reached the town of Kosinna, in Rambukkana district.
The temple was on a coconut estate at the end of a dirt path.
The compound included a preaching hall, monks’ quarters, and a separate shrine room.
In the open center of the compound were several chairs and lots of flowering plants, as well as beds of betel shrubs, which yield the betel leaves that the monks chewed for their mild narcotic effects.
My father presented me to the resident monk, who was a small man about sixty years old.
I would later find out that this man had been married before he ordained, and had lived in a house at the edge of the coconut estate, and that he had a grown son.
My father stayed with me at the temple for about two hours; then he left.
I was very tired and wanted only to sleep.
Already, my home and my childhood seemed distant.
The next morning, the head monk gave me a book of basic Pali, the language the Buddha spoke and the one used in Theravada Buddhist chanting.
He told me I would need to memorize everything in the book to prepare for my ordination, and he outlined what would be expected of me.
I and the three other boys living at the temple were required to walk around the estate collecting fallen coconuts and stacking them in various places.
We also had to sweep, collect firewood for cooking, haul water, wash dishes, and do laundry.
Basically we were unpaid laborers — slaves, of a sort.
Our religious duties included picking flowers to be placed on the altar in the shrine room and attending devotional services every morning and evening.
The other boys cooked our meals every day.
My job was to go to the head monk’s former home and fetch special food prepared for him by his former wife.
Only he was allowed to eat those dishes.
The three other boys who lived at the temple were all older and bigger than I was.
These “temple boys” were not novice monks, as I would eventually be, but they had the opportunity to have a religious education by living at the temple and working in exchange for their room and board.
One of them was in charge of the betel shrubs.
The other managed the kitchen.
The third took care of the many dogs roaming the compound.
Generally, they did jobs that a monk was not allowed to do because of his vows, such as cooking or shopping.
This was to be my new life.
But I lived in that temple for only about three months.
One day I was in the kitchen washing a pot.
Two of the other boys stood nearby having a heated argument.
One boy threw a rock at the other and it hit me on the wrist.
My hand swelled immediately and was very painful.
I wrote my father a letter and told him what had happened.
Several days later, he arrived to take me home.
“I don’t want my boy at any temple where there are violent people,” he said.
He felt it was reasonable that a father might hit his son, but did not think this kind of behavior had any place in a temple.
I went back home with my father.
My mother and sisters were overjoyed to see me again, and it was wonderful to be back with Rambanda.
We all seemed to take up right where we had left off.
I spent most of my time running back and forth between my parents’ house and the house where my oldest sister lived with her husband and daughter.
They told me they would love to have a boy in their house, so why didn’t I come live with them?
It was tempting.
I loved them both very much, and my niece was like a sister to me.
And my situation, at that point, seemed very uncertain.
I was almost twelve and hadn’t been in school for four months.
But the desire to be a monk still burned in my heart.
I missed being in the robes.
So I asked my father to find another temple that would take me.
Several months later, in January 1939, my brother-in-law told my father he had heard of another temple, this one in the village of Malandeniya, looking for a boy to ordain.
It was called Sri Vijayarama, which means “prosperous and victorious.” My father and brother-in-law thought that Malandeniya was about six miles from our house, but they weren’t sure because none of us had ever been there.
My second home-leaving was much like the first: my mother’s rice milk; a clean white sarong; tears and feelings of both excitement and sadness on my part.
I felt happy anticipation of my future as a monk.
At the same time, reflecting on my experience at the previous temple, I was filled with anxiety over going to live in another strange place with strange people.
This time, both my father and brother-in-law would accompany me on the trip.
As we left, my mother told my brother-in-law, “Please take care of my boy.
Since you live close to that temple, bring me reports about my boy.”
Then we set off on foot, as my mother stood by the house.
I kept turning around to look at her, and each time, she was still standing there, farther and farther away, until I could no longer see her — and it was longer still before the tears dried on my cheeks.
There was no road to follow from our village to Malandeniya.
We walked along a footpath that crossed rice paddies, small creeks, and rubber tree plantations.
Every once in a while, we passed through other small villages.
Each time we asked directions to Malandeniya, someone would send us a little farther along the way.
Finally we approached a temple compound that was surrounded by barbed wire.
We later learned that this was to prevent the neighbors’ cattle from coming in and eating the small coconut trees on the grounds.
At the gate, strips of bamboo covered the wire so that it didn’t rip people’s sarongs as they stepped through.
When we walked in, we were greeted first by a pack of barking dogs, then by a few boys, and eventually by the head monk, a man of medium height, with sharp eyes and a very long nose.
He smiled, showing teeth stained dark by betel nuts.
My father, my brother-in-law, and I immediately knelt in the dirt and bowed three times.
The monk motioned us inside the temple and pointed to mats on the floor where we could sit.
The monk’s name was Venerable Kiribatkumbure Sonuttara Maha¬thera.
The title Mahathera, “great elder,” signified that he had been a bhikkhu for at least thirty-eight years.
He was then almost sixty years old and seemed very friendly; he smiled often.
My father introduced me to him and told him that I would like to live at the temple and ordain.
The monk looked me up and down, then nodded.
It was that simple.
I had been accepted.
My father and brother-in-law stayed about an hour, chatting with the monk, and then left.
The moment they disappeared from sight, I felt a great wave of loneliness wash over me.
I longed to run after them and tell them I had changed my mind, that I wanted to go home.
I started to cry, and I couldn’t stop for hours.
Venerable Sonuttara consoled me, saying that at the monastery I would have a very good home and I would learn Dhamma from very good teachers.
Then he gave me a worn mat and a dirty pillow to spread on the concrete floor for my bed.
The shrine room contained a wooden platform raised on pillars four feet high.
Its centerpiece was a very old, very ugly Buddha statue made of clay.
That Buddha, I remember, had terrible, mean-looking eyes. It was nothing like the serene statues seen in most Buddhist temples.
Evidently whoever sculpted it had not been schooled in the special qualities of the Buddha that are supposed to be depicted in statues of him.
On one side of the scowling Buddha was a picture of blue-skinned Vishnu, one of the chief Hindu deities.
On the other side was a portrait of Huniyam Devata, a god revered even today by some Sinhalese for his viciousness.
Some people say prayers in front of this deity to invoke its power against their enemies.
Vishnu and Huniyam were strange choices for the altar of a Buddhist temple, and the cumulative effect of these three statues was unsettling indeed.
In a separate building, about twenty feet from the shrine room, were three rooms, all of them dirty and dingy: the head monk’s sleeping quarters, a guest room for visiting monks, and a storeroom.
The kitchen was reached by way of an open-air corridor.
There was a small area for eating, also very dirty, and a wood cookstove with three stones on top, where pots could be placed over the fire.
Behind the kitchen was an outhouse exclusively for the use of the head monk.
We boys were told to relieve ourselves in an open area at the back of the temple compound.
And whenever we did so, the neighbors’ pigs would come and clean up after us.
Just as in the first temple, I had many duties assigned to me.
I was to split firewood for cooking, bring water from the well, sweep the grounds, pick flowers for the altar, cook, wash dishes, and feed the dozen dogs and cats that roamed the temple compound.
Between chores I was supposed to be memorizing Sanskrit stanzas from books called Sataka, which literally means “one hundred” but generally refers to “one hundred verses composed in praise of the Buddha.” When we memorized all of one book, we moved on to another.
One of the Sataka books explains the hundred and eight names of the Buddha, another presents the nine admirable qualities of the Buddha, and so on.
The purpose of forcing young boys to memorize those stanzas was threefold: to teach us correct Sanskrit pronunciation; to introduce us to the qualities of the Buddha; and most importantly, I think, to arouse faith and devotion in our young minds.
Each evening, as we recited our day’s memorizations, Venerable Sonuttara would turn the kerosene lamp very low so that I couldn’t cheat by reading my texts.
If I made mistakes or hadn’t memorized enough verses, he would get angry and slap me.
His slaps were more like “teaching aids,” not quite the same as the violence that made me want to leave the first temple.
Usually, though, I did well at the recitations.
I seemed to be a quick learner, and my teacher was pleased.
Within three months, he announced that I had progressed well and was ready for novice ordination.
Venerable Sonuttara consulted an almanac to choose an auspicious day and time for the ceremony.
Then he sent word to my parents and invited twenty monks from other temples in the district.
The oldest monk in the district, Venerable Alagoda Sumanatissa Nayaka Mahathera, would act as preceptor and administer my vows.
The day before the ceremony, the temple was a flurry of activity as guests arrived and villagers from Malandeniya prepared food for the visiting monks.
Many of my relatives came for the big day, including my father, brother-in-law, and Rambanda, my dear brother.
My mother could not travel that far because of her back injury.
She was heartbroken she couldn’t be there, my father told me, and I was very sad, too.
At ten o’clock in the morning, everyone gathered on a ten-by-forty-foot porch of the monks’ residence.
Normally an ordination ceremony would have been held in the shrine room, but because so many guests were there, my teacher decided the ceremony should be in the bigger space.
I wore a clean white shirt and sarong.
My father walked with me toward the assembled monks, who were sitting on the floor next to a makeshift altar, facing the crowd.
I knelt before the senior monk, Venerable Sumanatissa, and bowed three times.
He told me to seek permission from my father to enter the homeless life of a mendicant.
So I knelt in front of my father and repeated the ritual of three bows, each time touching my forehead to the floor at his feet to express respect.
I remember my father’s solemn face looking down at me.
When I returned to the monks, Venerable Sumanatissa cut a few strands of my hair with a pair of scissors and told me to repeat after him: “Hair on the head, hair on the body, nails, teeth, skin.” The parts of the body were to be my first subject of meditation.
It is a traditional assignment given to all novices, reflecting the Buddha’s First Foundation of Mindfulness, the physical form.
In one of his key discourses, the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, the Discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Buddha laid out four subjects toward which we should direct attention: our body, our feelings and emotions, our consciousness itself, and the mental objects of consciousness.
If we really look at those four things with total, undivided, and clear attention, we begin to see that they’re all in flux all the time.
They move and flow, changing from one moment to the next, leaving no possibility to cling to any one moment’s experience.
Contemplating those four constantly fluctuating objects, we see the impermanence of everything manifest in our own being.
Moreover, we see that there’s no difference between ourselves and others.
We are, each and every one of us, a conglomeration of body, feelings, consciousness, and mental objects.
Understanding this, we become more magnanimous with others.
Jealousy and separateness fade, and are replaced by growing compassion and loving-friendliness.
But not for a twelve-year-old boy in the midst of his novice ¬ordination — all of that, of course, is still a distant goal on the day a novice monk receives his first subject of meditation.
The older bhikkhus might equally well instruct a novice to work with any of the other four foundations of mindfulness, but they always choose the body because it is very easy, even for the beginner, to perceive.
The body is, so to speak, right there, in all its lust-producing, pain-creating, pride-swelling physicality.
And as I knelt before my preceptor, I had only the dimmest idea of what I would later learn about that first foundation of mindfulness.
The senior monk dropped the locks of my hair into my open palm.
That was a signal for a junior monk to come forward and lead me out to have the rest of my head shaved.
The head-shaving ritual, symbolic of a monk’s giving up material and worldly attachments, is always done in private, away from the audience of laypeople.
Once my head was bare, I was sent to take a bath in the temple well, behind the kitchen.
Then I dressed in white clothes again.
When I reentered the hall, I was carrying a folded bundle on top of my head — my monk’s robes.
I knelt before my preceptor.
Chanting in Pali, I asked the Venerable to receive the set of robes I had, and to ordain me as a novice monk so that I would be able to end all suffering and attain nibbana .
Again, three bows.
Then Venerable Sumanatissa administered the three refuges and the ten precepts that were to become the moral basis of my new life, chanting them in Pali with me repeating after him.
I go to the Buddha for refuge.
I go to the Dhamma for refuge.
I go to the Sangha for refuge.

I undertake the precept to abstain from killing.
I undertake the precept to abstain from stealing.
I undertake the precept to abstain from sexual activities.
I undertake the precept to abstain from lying.
I undertake the precept to abstain from taking intoxicating drinks and drugs, which cause infatuation and heedlessness.
I undertake the precept to abstain from eating after noon.
I undertake the precept to abstain from dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, and visiting theatrical shows.
I undertake the precept to abstain from wearing garlands, perfumes, unguents, cosmetics, and beautifying the body.
I undertake the precept to abstain from using luxurious chairs and beds.
I undertake the precept to abstain from accepting gold and silver.
After reciting these things, I made the formal request of my preceptor that he share the merits I had earned by this act of ordaining: “Venerable Sir, please rejoice in all the merits I have acquired and allow me to rejoice in all the merits that you have acquired.”
Then I made three more bows to him and bowed to all the other monks as well.
Finally, Venerable Sumanatissa announced my new name: Gunaratana, “Jewel of Virtue.”
Now I was a novice.
I was given a little cushion and told to sit among the other monks, though not too close! I sat, and a small parade of laypeople came forward, each one bowing and laying a small present before me.
There were towels, bars of soap, an umbrella — practical items useful to me in my new, simplified life.
The day concluded with a sumptuous meal.
I ate with the other monks, sitting on the floor.
The food offered at temples by laypeople is expressly for the monastics, and so I had never before been allowed to legitimately partake of it.
It was delicious.
That day was truly a high point in my life.
Everything was perfect, except for one thing: My beloved mother was not there.
I missed her very much.
Two weeks later, I went to see her.
She was overjoyed to see her youngest son, now with a shaved head, wearing the burnt-orange robes of an ordained bhikkhu.
She spread a clean towel at my feet and, sinking painfully to her knees, prostrated before me.
Three times her forehead touched the towel.
It was a reversal of the day I left home, when I had bowed to her.
Now she was paying her respects to me.
It was a powerful and moving moment for both of us.
“My dear little monk,” said my mother, tears in her eyes, “you should never disrobe.
The monk’s life is the best for you.
It is the life of freedom.
Never think of disrobing.”
From that day onward, whenever I visited home, Mother repeated this ritual and this request of me, always saying, “Never disrobe, my son.”
After my ordination, life at the temple changed, yet it didn’t.
There were still religious texts to memorize, chores to perform, punishments to endure.
Meals were certainly different, though.
Now, according to the precepts, I could not eat solid food after midday.
Basically, we had one large meal a day.
It was collected by going on alms round in the village.
As the resident novice, that was my job.
Every day, after my morning chores, I left the temple at about 9:30 A.M.
A large metal bowl, about the size of a soup tureen, hung from a wide cloth band around my neck, its mouth covered by a cotton cloth.
My duty was to collect food to feed both the head monk and myself from each of the sixty or so houses in the village.
Villagers stood in front of their huts, pots of rice or dahl or vegetables or sweet cakes in hand.
As I walked slowly by, maintaining silence and avoiding eye contact, they would place a spoonful of their offering in my bowl.
The alms round is still practiced today in villages all over Asia.
It’s a beautiful sight — long lines of monks walking silently, barefoot, and stopping in front of laypeople’s homes.
The devout villagers bow as they place food in the alms bowls.
Not a word is exchanged.
This practice is an ancient tradition bringing to life the interdependent relationship of monastics and laypeople.
The bhikkhus, who are not allowed by their vows to cook food, receive sustenance from the laypeople.
The laypeople, by offering food to the bhikkhus, receive spiritual merit and support the continuation of the Buddha’s way.
But for me, alms round was always stressful.
I had to visit all sixty homes and return to the temple precisely at 11 A.M.
If I was just five minutes late, my teacher would refuse to eat.
Monastic rules specified that our meal must be completed before noon, and my teacher didn’t want to eat hurriedly.
So I rushed through the village, not daring to miss even one house, because that would deprive its occupants of the merit of offering alms food, and then they would complain to my teacher and I’d receive a reprimand.
There were many dogs in that village, and they were hungry.
When they saw a small boy carrying a bowl of steaming, fragrant food, they became aggressive.
I tried to fend them off with the umbrella I carried to protect me against the blazing sun.
But I was never very successful.
Sometimes I tried to run away from the dogs, but with a heavy bowl hanging around my neck, that wasn’t easy.
Invariably I would fall, spilling food in the dust.
The dogs would rush me, snarling and snapping.
Many times I returned to the temple with bleeding legs and a half-empty alms bowl.
Some of the villagers seemed to feel sorry for me.
Whenever a particular dog had bitten me, they would come to the temple a few days later and announce that that dog had “died.”
This outcome was not at all something I would have wished for, but it was nonetheless what happened.
Every day after lunch, I helped the two temple boys clean the kitchen, then I left for a two-mile walk to a temple in the next village, where the head monk would drill me in Pali lessons.
I was able to memorize the verses easily, so this monk liked me very much.
Then, after my lessons, I would rush back to my temple for evening chores and devotions, a ritual of reciting the qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
After that service, we had tea and I studied some more.
We were usually in bed by 9:30 P.M.
The wake-up gong sounded at four o’clock the next morning.
Like my father, Venerable Sonuttara had a temper.
He used abusive language to insult me and the temple boys.
If we broke any rules or strayed from the daily schedule in the slightest, he didn’t hesitate to hit us with whatever he could lay his hands on: rocks, sticks, bricks, a broom, even a knife.
So I tried hard to follow the rules.
As soon as I got up at 4:00 every morning, I would begin to cook breakfast and heat water.
By 5:00, my teacher expected the water, so he could wash his face.
Then I had to pick fresh flowers and arrange them on the altar for morning devotions at 5:30.
Breakfast was to be ready precisely at 6:00.
Venerable Sonuttara wanted the dogs’ plates placed next to where he sat, so he could feed them with his own hands.
We could not eat until he finished, then we had to gulp our food in order to get to our next chores quickly.
After I was ordained a novice, I was allowed to eat near my teacher, but he sat on a chair and put his plate on a table.
I was nearby, sitting on the floor, with my plate on a low bench in front of me.
When I returned from alms round at 11:00, we went through a similar ritual of serving lunch and gobbling our own meals.
At 1 P.M. our teacher expected his tea on a special table.
Then I went to the other temple for my Pali lessons, returning no later than three in the afternoon.
By 5:30, the flowers and garden were to be watered and then I had time for a quick bath before evening devotional chanting at 6:00.
At 6:30, I was expected to serve the Venerable his tea.
At 7:00 I recited my memorized verses for him.
Afterward, I prepared his betel chewing mixture, to be served at 7:30.
Then there was final cleanup and bed.
On full-moon and new-moon days, we enjoyed a break from the routine.
Instead of manual laborers, we were hosts to the villagers who would come to spend that special day at the temple.
Most of them were elderly and could not read or write.
In most temples, monks would read Jataka tales to the laypeople and explain their significance.
The whole collection of Jataka tales is 550 stories, each one illustrating how the Buddha in a previous rebirth manifested a certain noble quality: generosity, say, or moral integrity, renunciation, wisdom, effort, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-friendliness, and equanimity.
Sometimes in the Jataka tales, the Buddha is some kind of animal; always he is a bodhisattva, or one who is in the preparatory phases of becoming a Buddha.
Because I had a fourth-grade education, I was something of a hero to the uneducated villagers who came to our temple.
They loved to listen to me recite the tales in my girlish, prepubescent voice.
One day I remember telling a story from the human life of the Buddha.
I said that after leaving his father’s palace and cutting off his hair, Prince Siddhattha became an ascetic.
He wrapped a length of yellow cloth around himself and collected food in an alms bowl.
One of the villagers listening, an old man who reminded me of my grandfather, said, “Little monk, I think you are wrong.
I think the yellow robe and alms bowl were not introduced to the world until Siddhattha became the Buddha and began his order of monks.”
I answered him: “Sir, the Sanskrit word for bowl is patra, which literally means any kind of container open at the top.
Certainly such items were in use prior to the Buddha’s coming.
They were commonly used by mendicants.
And the Sanskrit word for yellow cloth is kashaya vastra, which refers to any piece of yellow cloth.
Why couldn’t Siddhattha wrap himself in a length of yellow cloth?”
As I recall, my answer pleased the old man very much.
But not everything that took place at the temple was so lofty.
One day the temple boys, who were older than I was, invited me to smoke tobacco with them.
I did, and thus an addiction was born.
We could not afford to buy cigarettes, so we stole tobacco from the head monk’s room, where he kept a supply of it to mix with betel and areca nuts, for chewing.
We’d wrap the tobacco in scraps of newspaper and smoke secretly.
Every once in a while our teacher would discover us smoking and beat us for it.
But that didn’t deter us; we just became more and more careful about not getting caught.
One day after returning from alms round, I lit a small roll of tobacco in the kitchen and began to smoke it.
My teacher appeared, carrying a bucket, on his way to bathe in the well.
He stopped and looked directly at me: I was caught red-handed.
“I’m not going to beat you this time,” he said.
“But what should I do to you if I catch you doing this again? You tell me.”
I swallowed hard.
My teacher’s anger was intimidating.
I knew there was only one answer to that question.
“If you see me smoking again, you should beat me as much as you wish,” I said.
But I didn’t stop smoking; I was thoroughly addicted.
A couple of weeks later I was caught in the act again.
Venerable Sonuttara beat me with his bare hands.
After that, he locked up his tobacco so we couldn’t get at it.
Again, we were undeterred and simply became more resourceful: We sold coconuts, towels, handkerchiefs, and rice, whatever we had on hand — usually gifts from laypeople — to buy our tobacco.
As I got nearer to my teenage years I felt stirrings of independence.
I was no longer so afraid of Venerable Sonuttara’s unpredictable rage.
His extreme punishments seemed unfair and cruel and I began to resent him.
I also began to feel that my education was lacking.
I was thirteen years old and I had only completed the fourth grade — an accomplishment in those days, but still not enough for me.
Neither my teacher nor the monk in the neighboring temple who taught me Pali had any formal education.
I wanted to learn more, a desire that would stay with me for my entire life.
The temple began to feel like a prison.
This was not the luminous religious life I had dreamed of.
One day, after lunch, Venerable Sonuttara went to take a nap.
One of the other boys decided he wanted an orange from the tree outside our teacher’s room.
He started throwing rocks into the tree to knock down an orange.
The noise woke our teacher.
He came out of his room, furious, and demanded to know who had been making such a racket.
One of the other boys said it was me, that I was throwing rocks.
And now suddenly I was furious, too.
I asked the boy, in very unpleasant language, why he was lying to our teacher.
Venerable Sonuttara turned on me.
He said I was disrespectful.
He said he didn’t care who had been throwing rocks and that because I was being disrespectful, I was the one to be punished.
He seized a broomstick and hit me over and over until I fell to the floor.
I could hardly breathe.
That was the last straw for me.
Later in the afternoon, I gathered my books as usual. It was time to go to Kebilitigoda temple for my Pali lessons.
I started out the door just as my teacher and the other boys headed toward the back of the compound to dig a new latrine.
I watched them go, then I quietly went back inside and threw down my books.
I went into the room where the temple boys kept their clothes and grabbed a white shirt and a sarong.
Without a pang of regret, I took off my robes and put on the shirt and sarong.
Exhilaration rising inside me, I slipped out the front door of the temple, through the barbed-wire gate, and onto the hard-packed road.
I was no longer a novice monk.
I was free.
CHAPTER THREE. Escape
WHEN I DISROBED and left the temple, there was no question in my mind where I was headed: home.
First, though, I stopped at my sister’s house.
My brother-in-law seemed only mildly surprised to see me.
He had heard of my struggles and, smiling, he said, “It’s good that you left that place.
Stay here awhile, and I’ll find you another temple.” But I was afraid that if I stayed there, Venerable Sonuttara would come looking for me.
So I ran home to my parents’ house.
My mother was shocked to see me.
She asked why I had left the temple, so I told her what had happened.
She didn’t say much, just started to cry.
In the evening my father came home from working in the rice paddy.
I told him about the abuse I had endured at the temple.
I could see from the expression on his face that he didn’t believe me, but he stayed calm.
My brother and sisters all seemed glad to see me, but no one had much to say.
They simply accepted my being there.
We all seemed to know it couldn’t last, though.
It was taboo for a monk to disrobe.
It brought bad luck, even disgrace, to the whole family.
The next afternoon my teacher arrived at the house.
My parents, out of respect for the monk, didn’t ask him to explain why I had run away from him.
They pretended not to know anything about what had happened.
After a few minutes of casual conversation, Venerable Sonuttara asked me to return to the temple with him.
I looked at my parents, silently pleading for their help, hoping they would rise to my defense and say they wanted me to stay with them.
For a minute or two, no one said anything.
There was complete silence.
My parents seemed unable to look at me.
Then my teacher repeated his request.
My father nodded his head and said quietly, “Yes, you must go with him.”
My heart sank.
I knew that if I stayed, my father would simply force me to return to the temple the next day, or the day after that.
And I didn’t want to bring disgrace on my family.
So I left with Venerable Sonuttara.
As soon as we got back to the temple, he ordained me again, in a ceremony much less elaborate than the first one.
For the second time in my life, I put on orange robes.
I could only hope it would go better this time.
My teacher, as a member of the monks’ council, a governing body of our sect, had to spend the month between the full moon of June and the full moon of July in Kandy.
During that month, the council held higher ordination ceremonies for novice monks, sometimes conferring full monkhood on as many as thirty young men a day.
During my teacher’s absence I was to serve as head of the temple, even though I was barely thirteen years old and still a novice.
One day, while my teacher was gone and I was in charge, a man came to the temple asking for oranges.
We had two orange trees on the premises, so whenever villagers needed oranges they came to us.
He gave me a little less than one rupee, the equivalent of about twenty-five cents.
One of the temple boys had gone to Kandy with Venerable Sonuttara, so only the other boy, named Hinnimahattaya, was there with me.
Normally we shared everything, like partners.
So as soon as the villager left with his sack of oranges, Hinnimahattaya asked me for his share of the proceeds.
“He only gave me twenty-five cents,” I told Hinnimahattaya, “and out of that we have to buy sugar, tea, and some kerosene for the lamps for tonight.”
Hinnimahattaya got very upset and let loose a string of filthy words. I beat him up.
Another time, we had run out of matches to light the kerosene lamps.
I asked Hinnimahattaya to run to a neighbor’s house and bring back a burning stick.
That was very common in those days, to “borrow” fire from your neighbor.
But Hinnimahattaya refused to go.
So I threatened him: If he wouldn’t go get the burning stick, I wouldn’t give him half of my next cigarette.

But Hinnimahattaya was unpersuaded.
He was willing to give up his half of a smoke in return for not running the errand.
So I went myself, and when I came back with the burning stick, I used it to light a cigarette.
Eagerly Hinnimahattaya watched me.
As soon as half of the cigarette was gone, he asked me for the second half.
“Forget it,” I said.
“A deal is a deal.
I ran the errand, and so you don’t get the cigarette.”
Hinnimahattaya started to curse me.
Enraged, I pushed him up against the wall, held him there, and used the cigarette to burn both corners of his mouth.
It also happened that, during the Venerable’s trip to Kandy, several teenage boys from the village came to the temple and stayed with us.
We played lots of games.
Of course, as a novice monk I wasn’t supposed to be entertaining myself with games, but who cares when the teacher is not around?
One of our favorite games was called panca ganahava, which means “play with five.”
It involved tossing small seashells onto the floor and earning points based on whether the shells landed right-side up or not.
One day our next-door neighbor came over and said that he wanted to teach us a card game.
He showed us a game and got us interested.
He made sure we won several games in a row, then he said, “If you have money, you can bet on this game.
Today is your lucky day.
You seem to be winning.”
I told him I only had one rupee.
He said, “That’s good.
Let’s play for money.”
I bet my one rupee and immediately won two more! I was hooked.
He encouraged me to play again.
Of course, that time I lost.
The neighbor pocketed the three rupees and left, smiling.
That was the end of my short gambling career and one lesson I learned in just a single try.
On the afternoon my teacher returned from Kandy, the very first thing he did was examine the bowl we used for offering food to the Buddha statue in the shrine room.
Our instructions had been to empty it each day before noon.
That day, the Venerable found it still full at one o’clock.
I was in the kitchen at the time, preparing tea for him.
He called me and I came out of the kitchen and started down the steps into the main building.
Suddenly I saw an object flying toward me — the alms bowl from the shrine room! My teacher was so upset that he had thrown the bowl at me before even asking why it was still full.
The bowl hit me square in the forehead, hard, and I fell to the ground, bleeding.
I still have a scar on my forehead, to this day.
Our teacher also noticed the burn marks around Hinnimahattaya’s mouth.
“How did this happen?” the Venerable asked me.
I had warned Hinnimahattaya not to tell our teacher about the incident with the cigarette.
If he did, we would both be in trouble for smoking.
Fortunately, Hinnimahattaya said nothing.
I told Venerable Sonuttara that the temple boy had cursed me, so I burned his mouth as punishment.
Curiously, he seemed to accept that story and said nothing more about it.
That was one of the rare times when I got away with something, though.
My teacher’s temper was uncontrollable and the beatings continued, often for the slightest infraction of the rules.
He was the dictator, and we had to accept his every command without question or discussion.
Yet for all that, Venerable Sonuttara did have a kind streak.
He had a real soft spot for animals; that’s why he fed all the stray dogs and cats in the area.
And if sick people came to the temple seeking help, he gave them free herbal medicines.
Occasionally one of the temple boys would run away, taking something of value with him, such as a brass oil lamp or even one of the Buddha statues.
“Let him go,” my teacher would say.
“He is poor.
He can sell those things and get a little money.
We can replace whatever he stole.”
In reflecting now upon my teacher’s behavior, I think that Venerable Sonuttara really did want to see me become a good monk and not be led astray by my natural adolescent urges for independence.
And he “encouraged” good behavior by using the normal form of punishment in those days: physical beatings.
Of course, I couldn’t see it that way until later, when I was an adult.
At the time I lived in his temple as a novice, I was miserable.
I chafed continually under his dominance.
At one point, I began to talk to one of the temple boys about leaving.
He was very unhappy, too.
Both of us were saving up money and hoarding candles, and we planned to run away some night.
One day we agreed to escape that night.
We both worked harder than usual that day, in order to please our teacher so that he wouldn’t suspect anything.
That night, after everyone in the temple went to bed, I removed my robes and put on a sarong and shirt.
My accomplice and I sneaked out the back door.
First we had to go through a cemetery, which unnerved both of us.
Then we found ourselves on a wooden bridge over a small creek.
We had heard the local stories that this was a place where wicked demons and goblins grabbed people.
The legend also said that the first sign of their appearance would be a big black dog.
Normally, if people had to pass over that bridge they would go in a large group, everyone talking loudly and carrying bright torches to scare away the demons.
But because we were running away, we had to be quiet and we couldn’t even light the candles we had brought with us, for fear someone would see us.
We crossed the bridge at exactly midnight.
We were trembling, dry-mouthed.
Our hair stood on end.
We didn’t utter one word to each other, just walked slowly in the pitch dark.
Suddenly, a big black dog appeared in front of us, and my heart began pounding even harder.
Then we were both slapped so hard in the face we nearly fell off the bridge and into the water.
It turned out that the big black dog was our temple dog and the slaps came from our teacher, who had heard us sneaking out the back door and followed us to the bridge.
On his orders, we followed him back to the temple, where I was immediately ordained a third time, in the middle of the night.
None of the other temple boys ever heard about that incident, nor did the villagers.
The next day, back in my bhikkhu’s robes, I took the alms bowl and went into the village to collect alms as usual.
When I was fifteen or so, I became interested in a girl from the village who was about my age.
Every day she would stand in front of her house as I came by with the alms bowl.
She was near my height, with long black hair.
She had a round face like mine, with skin lighter than the normal Sinhalese complexion, and a perfect set of teeth that showed whenever she smiled.
I thought she was beautiful.
One day, as she ladled rice into my bowl, we had a very brief, whispered ¬conversation — very much against the monastic rules.
That evening, when I went to our well to take a bath, I deliberately banged the bucket against the sides of the well to make a noise loud enough for her to hear at her house.
That was the signal we had agreed on.
Within moments she ran to the well, carrying a pot as if she needed to fill it with water.
I was thrilled to see her coming.
For about ten days, that was our routine.
I would bang the bucket in the well; she would grab a pot in her house and, if it was full of water, pour it out so that she had an excuse to come to the well.
Even though we were too shy to share our budding feelings for each other, we had long, lovely conversations, and each time, they got longer and longer.
I told her that temple life was like a prison.
We gossiped about other people in the village.
She told me about her life at home.
Eventually my teacher began to wonder why I was taking so long at my bath, and one day he came to check on me and caught us there, talking and laughing.
Of course he was upset.
Monks of any age are not supposed to have close contact with females.
He ordered the girl not to come to the well when I was there.
Back at the temple, he reprimanded me in very strong language and ordered me to take my baths later at night, at a time he thought would be too late for her to come to the well.
Actually, that suited me fine because I knew we would have even more privacy to talk after dark, when no one would see us together.
So we continued our clandestine meetings.
Inevitably, my teacher caught us again, and this time his rebuke was even harsher.
He told the girl never to come to the well again.
He said that he was going to report her behavior to her parents.
She cried and begged him not to tell her parents.
She promised not to go to the well anymore, and she didn’t.
I never saw her again.
When I look back on that incident now, after years of Dhamma study and practice, I see it as evidence that boys perhaps should not be ordained so young, as was customary in my childhood.
They should first receive a secular education and be allowed to enjoy games, sports, friends, and parties — all the things that young people crave.
Then, when they have grown into adults, they can make a mature decision about whether to be ordained.
Joining the Sangha is a serious commitment, and I don’t think a very young person is prepared to make an informed choice about it.
And it would be a rare boy who was emotionally ready to cope with the rigors and restrictions of monastic life.
The traditional thinking in my country was that boys, with their vigorous young minds, could memorize sacred texts more easily than adults.
Their personalities could be shaped and molded early into the peaceful demeanor of a contemplative monk.
But now I’m not so sure that’s true.
I have seen plenty of men who became monks in middle or old age, after being married and having raised children, and they make fine bhikkhus.
And I’ve seen too many monks, on the other hand, who were ordained before puberty, continue to behave like children.
After Venerable Sonuttara cut off my budding romance with the girl at the well, my dissatisfaction with temple life deepened.
I was a teenager, with a mind of my own and a desire for a more formal education than this teacher could offer me.
I wanted to remain a monk, but not under the yoke of this particular Venerable.
I could think of no solution except to run away again, but where to? I knew I could no longer go home.
My parents would be heartbroken if I disrobed again.
I couldn’t bring them into this shameful plan.
About that time, a father and son came to live at the temple.
The son’s name was Gunawardhena, and he and I became very good friends.
He kept telling me that he knew another place that was better than this temple, so we hatched a plan to run away together.
This time, I intended to do it right.
I would run away so that no one would ever find me.
On the chosen day I had the village barber shave my head as usual.
The whole day I was in a fever of anticipation; so was Gunawardhena.
At eleven o’clock that night, I went to the outhouse, and when I came back I left the front door slightly open.
At about twelve-thirty, we heard our teacher snoring.
We picked up several candles and walked to the kitchen, where I slipped off my robes and, yet again, pulled on a sarong and shirt.
Leaving the temple grounds, we headed in the direction opposite the one I had used in my last getaway.
As fast as we could, we ran through rice fields to the main road two miles away.
All around us were the sounds of nocturnal birds, frogs and crickets, and dogs barking in the distance.
Once we reached the road we slowed down to a walk.
Soon we saw two people holding lanterns coming toward us.
It was 1942, during the Second World War, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew had been imposed over all of Ceylon.
Nervously, Gunawardhena spoke to me, using not my ordained name but my lay name.
“Ukkubanda, those are policemen.
They’re going to ask us all kinds of questions.
What shall we tell them?”
In a flash I made up an entirely fictitious story: “Tell them my mother died yesterday, and that somebody came to the temple to give us the message.
We missed the bus to go to her funeral, so now we’re walking along the road, and are hoping to catch another bus in the morning.”
The policemen reached us and eyed me suspiciously.
I had a handkerchief tied around my shaved head, and another tied around my neck.
Because I had no belt, I was wearing another handkerchief around my waist to hold up my sarong.
The bundle of candles in my hand, too, was wrapped in a handkerchief.
“Look at this rascal,” one of the policemen said.
“He has ¬handkerchiefs all over him.”
They separated me from Gunawardhena and took us about ten yards apart, then asked each of us the same question: Where were we going in the middle of the night?
Both of us told the same story, so the policemen let us go, not even mentioning the curfew.
All they said was to be sure to use a candle as we walked.
Within two hours we arrived at Kurunegala, about eleven miles from the temple.
Now we felt safer and were pretty sure Venerable Sonuttara wouldn’t follow us this far.
Just as it was starting to get light, we came upon a roadside shelter, one of many typical structures known as pilgrims’ rest houses.
The hut had low walls, a straw roof, and a dirt floor upon which people rolled out straw mats to lie down on.
Most of the time, these primitive, open-air huts were occupied by travelers resting in the shade and beggars cooking whatever food they had scrounged.
Gunawardhena and I were lucky.
This particular shelter was unoccupied that morning.
Gratefully, we sank to the ground and were asleep almost immediately.
Several hours later, we woke up and washed our faces with cold water from a well.
We started walking again, not knowing exactly where we were going.
We just walked.
The scenery changed constantly.
We passed coconut groves, rubber and tea estates, terraced rice paddies, banana plantations, and small vegetable gardens outside one-room huts.
There seemed to be stray dogs everywhere, many of which had completely lost their fur, and more with numerous wounds from bites of other dogs or beatings by humans.
Often we saw wild monkeys swinging in the trees or running on the ground.
In the distance, every so often, we could hear elephants trumpeting.
There were occasional cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and rickshaws, all honking their horns to warn pedestrians and people sitting in the road.
But most of the traffic was human.
We passed men, women, and children simply walking or herding cows and chickens.
Some rode in primitive wooden carts pulled by oxen.
Along the roadsides were small mud huts that functioned as shops.
People sat in front of them, chewing betel nuts and drinking tea and gossiping.
Travelers could stop and buy tea, small loaves of bread, areca nuts, dried fish, ropes made of coconut fiber, and occasionally staples such as sugar, salt, rice, lentils, and kerosene.
Gunawardhena and I had a little money we had stolen from Venerable Sonuttara’s room before leaving the temple, so we bought a couple of loaves of bread.
On somebody’s land next to the road we saw a heap of coconuts.
We stole one and broke it open by smashing it against the ground.
The flesh of that coconut, and the bread, was our first meal on our journey.
We walked twenty-five miles that day.
Late in the evening we arrived at a town called Dambulla.
We found another empty pilgrims’ rest house, spread some palm fronds on the floor, and lay down.
We were exhausted.
The next morning we woke to find ourselves covered with ticks and sand flies.
We went to a nearby well, and there, we broke sticks from a bush and started to brush our teeth with their fibrous ends.
A monk approached us, eyeing me carefully.
I tried to ignore him.
“Have you been a monk?” he asked, looking at my hairless head.
“No,” I lied easily.
“I’ve been sick.
I just got out of the hospital yesterday.”
“You don’t look like you’ve been sick,” he said.
“I think you’re a monk.
Come with me.
I’ll ordain you again, at my temple.”
I considered his offer.
I still had a desire to be a monk, deep inside me.
I had only disrobed because Venerable Sonuttara had been so cruel.
This monk seemed kinder.
But of course, I couldn’t go without consulting my friend.
I turned to Gunawardhena.
“What do you think?” I asked him.
“I really don’t want to disrobe.
Here is a chance for me to be a monk again.”
“Are you crazy?” Gunawardhena said.
“Don’t you remember what our teacher did to us? All these monks are alike.
They have no heart.
They only think about their rules and regulations.
Don’t be a fool, let’s go.”
The monk sweetened his offer.
He said that he knew some British officers at a nearby military airport.
He could get Gunawardhena a job there, he promised.
We could both live at the temple, and I could be a monk while Gunawardhena worked at the airport.
Gunawardhena would hear none of it, and I didn’t want to abandon my friend.
So we left the monk and started walking again.
The next day we ran into a man who said that he worked for a civilian contractor.
“If you want to work, come with me,” the man told us.
“We have plenty of jobs available.”
We agreed.
Our job turned out to be hard manual labor.
We were given two shovels and two bamboo baskets and told to collect sand from a creek bed, then pile it in large heaps for collection.
For several months we worked there, part of a crew of about twenty young men. We worked from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.
Our pay was 1.2 rupees a day, the equivalent of about fifty cents.
Out of that salary, the boss deducted about twenty-five cents for our meals.
Breakfast was a cup of tea with sugar, and dinner was rice with lentils.
We slept in hammocks made by tying a gunny sack between two trees.
The jungle was alive with mosquitoes.
They bit us night and day, and sure enough, before long, Gunawardhena came down with malaria.
He had a high fever and could not work.
I asked our boss for two days off, so I could take care of my friend.
He refused.
“I’ve worked for you for months, seven days a week, twelve hours a day,” I said.
“All I want is a couple of days’ break.”
Again, he refused.
Either I had to keep working, or both Gunawardhena and I had to leave the work camp.
“All right,” I said.
“Give us the rest of our salary.”
The boss paid us, and we left.
Thus began our life as beggars.
By day we wandered along dusty roads.
By night we shared other beggars’ meager meals in the roadside huts, telling jokes, singing, and dancing to pass the time.
For several weeks we didn’t bathe.
Our clothes were filthy and we smelled bad.
Every morning the other beggars would leave for “work” and ask us which area we planned to beg in that day.
“We don’t know,” was always our answer.
The truth was, we didn’t beg at all.
We just ate whatever food other people were willing to share with us.
We were lazy beggars.
Gradually Gunawardhena recovered from malaria and regained his strength.
But then, one morning I woke up with severe pain in my right leg. I felt feverish.
Looking closely at my leg, I found a red blotch on the thigh about four inches above my knee.
One of the beggars sharing our shelter peered at the wound and declared it a snakebite.
The pain was excruciating, and I could barely lift my leg.
Gunawardhena and I stayed behind when the other beggars left.
After about two hours, I struggled to my feet and limped out of the hut.
We had barely walked ten yards when we ran into a man about twenty-five years old.
Neither of us had ever seen him before.
For some reason I couldn’t understand, he and Gunawardhena struck up an instant friendship.
They started joking and laughing like old buddies.
Probably Gunawardhena was feeling weighed down by me and my lame leg; he was relieved to run into someone who was more fun.
The three of us walked together, with me lagging behind.
Within five minutes, Gunawardhena turned to me.
“Ukkubanda, since you can’t walk very fast, why don’t I go ahead with this man? You take your time and walk as slow as you need.
We’ll wait for you in Lovamahapaya.”
I was immediately struck with fear.
Lovamahapaya was a six- or seven-hour walk.
“No, don’t leave me alone,” I begged.
“I can’t walk by myself.
I need your help.
Please stay with me.”
Then the incomprehensible happened: Gunawardhena ignored me and simply walked away with his new friend.
I sat down and started crying.
My leg was throbbing.
I couldn’t believe what was happening.
How ungrateful Gunawardhena was.
We had planned our adventure together, weeks ahead of time, and I had given up the monkhood to run away with him.
When he got sick in the jungle, I had given up the construction job.
All these months, we had been traveling friends.
We had depended on each other.
And now, when I needed him most, he had abandoned me.
I had no companion, no home, no money, no food.
I was at rock bottom, and I was utterly alone.
What in the world was I going to do?
CHAPTER FOUR. A Monk Once Again
FOR AN HOUR after Gunawardhena had abruptly left me by the roadside, I just sat there, alone and confused.
What had started out as the great adventure of running away from our temple had turned into a frightening ordeal.
I had a leg badly swollen from snakebite, I was hungry, and my traveling companion was gone forever, for all I knew.
I had never felt so low in my life.
Eventually, though, something inside me commanded me to get up.
“Keep moving,” the voice seemed to say.
So I got to my feet and started limping along the deserted road.
I walked for several hours until finally I came upon a girl sitting in the shade of a tree.
She was selling fruits, nuts, bread, tea, and vegetables.
I sat down on a rough bench.
“Why are you limping?” she asked me.
I explained that a snake had bitten my leg the night before.
The girl asked me more questions: what my name was, where I came from, and why I was traveling alone.
I told her my whole story.
She gave me a piece of bread with lentil curry, and a good cup of hot tea.
Gratefully, I accepted the meal.
She went inside her tiny hut and came out with a piece of lemon.
She rubbed the lemon on the wound in my thigh, then massaged some oil into it.
She asked me to stay there until her father came home from work, but I said that I needed to get to Lovamahapaya to meet my friend.
I was hoping Gunawardhena might indeed be waiting for me there.
I started down the road again, still limping.
Pretty soon I arrived in the town of Anuradhapura.
One of the first places I saw was a restaurant called the Siyasiri Hotel .
The manager greeted me, then asked why I was limping.
I told him about the snakebite.
He asked why I was alone.
I told him how I couldn’t keep up with my traveling friend, so he had gone on ahead to Lovamahapaya.
“Everybody who passes through here comes to this hotel,” the manager said.
“Stay here.
If they come through this town, when they arrive you’ll see them.”
I agreed, and sat down to wait.
By 11 P.M., my head was nodding.
The manager could see I was very tired.
“You should stay overnight,” he said.
He gave me a straw mat to sleep on.
And that was the last thing I knew until eight o’clock the next morning.
As soon as I woke up, I asked the manager if Gunawardhena had arrived.
“No,” he said, shaking his head.
“Nobody came looking for you.
But you stay here, I can give you a little job.”
I didn’t know what else to do, or where else to go, so I accepted his offer.
And thus I became a waiter at the Siyasiri Hotel in Anuradhapura.
It was a pleasant enough job.
Several other young people worked at the restaurant, and we all got along well.
I waited on customers, cleaned tables, and washed dishes.
One day, several weeks later, I came down with a malarial fever and felt too sick to work.
While resting, I wrote my mother a letter to let her know where I was.
I felt guilty, knowing that she probably had heard the news of my running away from the temple, and that she must be worried sick about me.
A few days later, when I was back at work, I went to the nearby well to draw water for the restaurant.
Another boy was there, too.
I borrowed his bucket and used it to draw some water and pour it in my bucket.
As I handed his bucket back to him, the boy dropped it into the well, rope and all.
He started to cry, knowing how much trouble he would be in for losing the bucket.
But I had customers in the restaurant waiting for fresh water for their tea.
I had to hurry.
I told the boy that I would take my bucket of water to the restaurant, then I would come right back and help him fish his bucket out of the well.
But when I walked into the restaurant carrying a full bucket of water, my eldest brother, Tikiribanda, was standing at the entrance.
As soon as he caught sight of me, he demanded that I come home with him.
Mother was crying nonstop, he said, ever since she had heard the news of my escape from the temple.
My brother was almost as intimidating as my father.
I dared not disobey his command.
I forgot all about the poor boy waiting at the well for me to come and help him retrieve his bucket.
I forgot about the kind restaurant manager who had given me a chance to start a new life.
“I have opened a small shop,” my brother told me.
“You can come and help me run it.”
Later I found out that the day after Gunawardhena and I left the temple, Venerable Sonuttara had reported our disappearance to the police.
My father went to the temple and demanded my teacher find me and return me home.
By then, Father realized that Venerable Sonuttara was an angry, cruel man, and that my problems at the temple were not just due to my misbehavior.
My father knew that my stories of being abused at the hands of my teacher were not lies, but by then, of course, it was too late.
I had left the temple, and that time, I didn’t run home.
Meanwhile, police officers were combing the countryside for me.
Then came my letter from Anuradhapura. Mother and Father immediately dispatched my oldest brother to fetch me.
My parents, especially my mother, were overjoyed to see me alive and well, but it was uncomfortable being in their house again.
All the neighbors called me “ex-monk,” which was a great insult.
My father didn’t want to have an “unlucky” son around; he asked me to reordain.
To keep away from Father so that we didn’t have to talk much, I kept busy at a series of small jobs.
One of them was digging flood-control ditches on a rubber estate near our house.
This estate was run by a large company.
They paid a meager salary, and the work was backbreaking.
I would fill bucket after bucket with soil, and then women carried the buckets to a dumping ground.
One time, one of those women saw the deep blisters on my hands from the shovel, and she offered to trade jobs with me.
So for a while, she dug the soil and I carried the full buckets.
After that job, I picked tea leaves.
That also was monotonous, hard labor.
I would have preferred to work at my brother’s shop, of course, but he had closed it only a couple of months after opening.
People in the village were too poor to support his shop.
Most of them couldn’t afford to buy even the simplest staples.
I spent much of my free time at my sister’s house, the same sister who had nursed me when I was young, the woman I called my second mother.
Since her husband had died, there was no adult male in the house. It was only my sister, her infant son, and her one daughter, my niece, who was just five months older than me.
They were very kind to me and I felt more at home with them than with my own parents.
So a few weeks after I had returned home, I moved from my parents’ house to my sister’s house.
That was a more peaceful arrangement, but I still wasn’t really comfortable with the life of a householder.
My original desire to be a monk still burned within me, despite everything that had happened.
I began to think more and more about my teacher and the temple I had left five months before.
I felt regret for having run away.
My mind had softened toward Venerable Sonuttara, and I remembered his good qualities.
I thought that I should at least apologize to him.
One day, when my sister had gone to visit her dead husband’s relatives, I decided I would secretly go to see my teacher.
It was anovernight visit because of the distance, but I figured I could be back before my sister returned.
I knew she wouldn’t approve of this visit.
She wanted me to live at her house permanently and give up my dreams of being a monk.
As I was preparing to leave, my niece cried and asked me not to go.
I told her not to worry and that I’d be back the next day.
She continued to cry as I walked off in the direction of the temple.
When Venerable Sonuttara saw me he was relieved.
Even though he wasn’t always the kindest teacher, he wanted to keep me in monks’ robes as much as I wanted to be in them.
I apologized for running away, and he asked me if I was ready to ordain again.
“Yes,” I answered, certain of my decision.
“But I don’t want to live in the temple as a novice.
I want to go to monks’ school.”
He agreed immediately.
Two days later, after a simple ceremony, I was wearing the orange robes again.
This time, I would never take them off.
Venerable Sonuttara contacted another monk, Venerable Siyambalangamuwe Dhammakkhandha, who ran a small primary school for monks in the Gampaha district. It was about sixty miles from the temple.
Because Venerable Siyambalangamuwe and my teacher were friends, he readily accepted my application, and in April 1944, a month after my most recent ordination, I began my formal monastic education.
I attended school at Vidyasekhara Pirivena .
About twenty young bhikkhus and three teachers lived there.
We studied Ceylonese history and important Dhamma texts such as the Anguttara Nikaya and the Majjhima Nikaya .
We also were taught a whole host of languages: Sinhalese, Tamil, Hindi, English, Pali, and Sanskrit.
I was very happy at my new school, living among other teenage monks and spending my days studying.
But I hadn’t been there long before Venerable Siyambalangamuwe came to me with a request.
He said there was a temple in the village of Napagoda, and the head monk had disrobed, leaving the temple with no one in charge.
He asked if I would go there and run the temple.
I thought this would be a temporary arrangement, that I’d live there for a few weeks and then return to the monks’ school, so I agreed.
As it turned out, I lived in that temple for eight months.
There were no Dhamma or Pali studies there, just the usual monastic chores, the weary round of endless labor.
One day there was nothing to eat.
So I asked the temple boy, a youngster about my own age, to go buy some bread at a shop in the village.
He refused.
I asked him again.
He refused once more.
“I’ll ask somebody else to buy me some food, then, and I won’t share it with you,” I told him.
His response was to curse at me.
I kicked him several times.
Later that day, another monk who had been living with us for a time returned to the temple.
He happened to be the older brother of the temple boy.
He asked me what had happened, why the temple boy was no longer there.
When he heard my story, he got very upset.
“Well, since you chased off the only boy who was here to help us, it’s now your job to climb a coconut tree and get me a coconut.”
I refused.
“Monks don’t climb trees,” I pointed out.
“It’s against our rules.
And besides, my teacher didn’t send me here to climb trees and pick coconuts.”
After seven months of such frustration and petty disputes, my desire to learn made me so restless that I wrote to my teacher.
“Please send me back to the monks’ school,” I begged.
I was jubilant when, soon, I received a postcard from Venerable Siyambalangamuwe that said, “Yes, you can come back to school.”
I immediately hired an ox cart to take me to the train station in Veyangoda, four miles away.
I couldn’t wait to get back to Gampaha and reenroll in school.
When I got to the train station, I saw that the train to Gampaha didn’t leave for five hours, so I went to visit a temple nearby.
In that temple there was a young novice, maybe eight or nine years old, who took a liking to me.
He invited me to go swimming with him in the river next to the train station and I hesitantly agreed.
Although nearly seventeen years old, I had never learned to swim, but I was too proud to tell that to the young monk.
Little did I know that this single prideful act would soon threaten my life.
Pride, in the Buddha’s teaching, is one of the last of the five fetters that falls away when a person attains enlightenment.
It’s one of the twenty-seven mental impurities that the Buddha warned can trip us up.
To overcome infatuation with ourselves, he recommended a series of reflections a person should use:
I am of the nature to decay; I have not gone beyond decay.
I am of the nature to be diseased; I have not gone beyond disease.
I am of the nature to die; I have not gone beyond death.
All that is mine, dear and delightful, will change and vanish.
I am the owner of my kamma, heir to my kamma, born of my kamma, related to my kamma, I abide by my kamma.
Whatever kamma I shall create, whether good or evil, of that I shall be the heir.
At the river, the novice took off his outer robe and jumped into the water.
He swam like a fish.
I stood on the bank, admiring his easy, elegant strokes.
It didn’t look so difficult, but the last thing I wanted to do was jump into the muddy, fetid water.
The young boy saw me hesitating on the bank and urged me to join him.
Reluctantly I took off my outer robe and tied a knot in the folds of my inner robe so that it wouldn’t come off.
Then I held my breath, and jumped.
Within seconds I was in trouble.
My feet reached for the bottom, but all I felt was soft mud.
There was nothing solid to stand on.
I felt like I was sinking, and I started to struggle.
Panic rose inside me like an electric current.
My arms and legs flailed, and as I gasped for air, I swallowed the foul river water.
The little monk saw what was happening and tried to help.
He swam over to me, took hold of my ears, and pulled my head out of the water — ouch! But he wasn’t strong enough to pull the rest of my body above the surface.
I grabbed at his robe frantically, and in a moment it came loose.
Three times I went under, clutching that robe as if it would save me.
Three times I struggled back up, searching for help.
The last time, all I could see was the color red filling my entire field of vision.
I was losing consciousness.
CHAPTER FIVE. Monks’ School
WHEN I AWOKE, I was lying on the ground next to the river with a man kneeling over me.
I started coughing up river water as a large crowd stood around me and stared.
Later I was told that the young monk who had been swimming with me wouldn’t get out of the river because I had torn off his robe in my panic to stay afloat.
Naked, he had stood in waist-deep water at the edge of the river and screamed for help.
Apparently, a man came out of a tea shop next to the train station and asked what was the matter.
The young monk pointed to a spot in the river and said that I had drowned.
“He must be dead by now,” the monk had shouted.
The man from the tea shop jumped into the river, fully clothed, and searched underwater until he found me, unconscious, at the bottom.
He dragged me up onto the riverbank and started giving me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as a crowd gathered.
Eventually I sat up, coughing and sputtering.
I was a little shaken, but otherwise all right.
The young monk fetched his teacher, and together they walked me back to their temple, which was just fifty yards away.
They gave me a cup of hot coffee with lots of sugar, and a set of dry robes.
It was not long before I started feeling like myself again.
The head monk was very kind.
He asked me my name and where I was going.
When I told him, he sent an attendant to the train station to buy me a ticket to Gampaha.
After a few hours’ rest, I was on my way again.
Ironically, when I arrived at the monks’ school in Gampaha, the first person I talked to asked me why I sounded like a drowned person.
“I just have a cold,” I replied.
I was too embarrassed to tell the truth.
But the next day, there was my picture on the front page of Ceylon’s leading newspaper, along with a story about the teenage monk who nearly drowned in the river at the Veyangoda train station.
My fellow students at the monks’ school teased me about that for years.
Although tuition at the monks’ school was free, boarders were re¬quired to donate about five rupees a month.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have any money to pay the fee, so I was given an abandoned shed to sleep in.
The shed had a dirt floor, partial walls about four feet high, and no door.
I scavenged some gunnysacks, bamboo sticks, and ropes with which I fashioned a crude door and window shade.
For light, I had one earthen lamp that burned coconut oil.
This was my first kuti, the one-room hut that some monks live in, and I was delighted to have it.
I did most of my studying in my kuti.
Very quickly I became known as the smartest student in the school.
I discovered I had a photographic memory, clearly a gift of good kamma.
In ten minutes, I could read a long book and retain everything in it.
I don’t know how this worked; I just know that each page stuck in my mind like a picture.
I was very proud of my gift and asked my friends to challenge me by posing questions from books.
I could answer them with the page number, and even the punctuation, of the sentence in question.
Perhaps because of this, the principal of the school liked me and selected me to be his assistant.
I was also named treasurer, which meant that I organized and stored all the donations that came into the school — things such as robes, medicine, and toiletries.
Then I would dole them out to the student-monks as needed.
Because of my privileges and responsibilities, several of my fellow monks became jealous of me, and it didn’t help that I had developed the habit of reporting other students’ weaknesses to the principal! In short, I was a rat.
I filed report after report, detailing the wrongdoings of other monks.
I knew that I should be more concerned with my own behavior than with finding faults in others, but I wanted so much to maintain the approval of the principal.
It’s too bad that I didn’t take to heart the words of the Buddha, in the Dhammapada:
Easily seen is the fault of others, but one’s own is difficult to see.
Like chaff, one winnows another’s faults but hides one’s own, even as a crafty fowler hides behind sham branches.
He who seeks another’s faults, who is ever censorious, his cankers grow.
He is far from destruction of the cankers.
On full-moon days I gave half-hour Dhamma talks at the school.
Usually they were based on books I had read, but one time I decided that this might be boring for my audience.
So I decided to “wing it.
” All I did was memorize a three-page sutta, one of the Buddha’s sermons called Visakhuposatha Sutta.
Then I repeated it to my audience.
The experimental sermon was a disaster.
I was finished reciting within ten minutes, then I simply babbled on for five more minutes — about what, I can’t even remember.
It was embarrassing, and it taught me a valuable lesson about the value of diligent preparation.
From then on, I carefully prepared for each of my Dhamma talks.
I would choose a stanza from the Dhammapada and explain it using stories from the commentary.
The Dhammapada contains 423 stanzas, most of which teach about ethics and morality.
There are also hundreds of stories elsewhere in the Buddhist canon that illustrate the topics mentioned in the Dhammapada.
I enjoyed telling those stories, offering listeners a grounding in Buddhist morality.
It wasn’t until much later in my career as a monk that I again felt confident enough to give sermons without preparation.
At the monks’ school, at age seventeen, I was finally able to give up smoking.
It was a habit I had had for several years, but unfortunately, I only exchanged one addiction for another.
My new habit was chewing betel nut.
In time I became the comedian of the school.
Every night, I would hold court for an hour or so, telling jokes to the other students.
I enjoyed making them laugh.
One of my jokes was about a supporter of a temple who became angry that the monks there never shared any of his offerings with the Buddha image.
So he wrapped a rope around the neck of the Buddha statue and hung it from one of the rafters.
When the monks discovered what he had done and demanded to know why, he called it a suicide.
“The Buddha statue said it couldn’t continue living in such a place,” he told them.
Amazingly, the principal did not object to such irreverent comedy.
Usually, after my performance was finished, we went to his room and enjoyed a chew together.
He was a wise man when it came to dealing with teenage monks.
He was strict, but also very gentle.
He knew how to motivate us without forcing us, which might have destroyed our interest in learning.
He encouraged us to be disciplined monks.
“Laypeople will look up to you,” he would say.
“They know you have sacrificed sensual pleasure to devote your lives to the practice of Dhamma, so you must earn that respect.”
I almost never had any money, but it didn’t matter.
My humble housing was free, I collected my food on alms round, and instead of buying textbooks, I borrowed them from friends and copied the material by hand.
I simply trusted that I would have whatever I needed to finish my education.
I had a lot of confidence in myself and also in the Triple Gem — the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
I felt like the Buddha was alive and walking with me through life, providing me with whatever I needed.
I was certain the Dhamma would protect me because I was ardently struggling to learn the Buddha’s teachings.
And I thought that because I was a member of the Sangha, I would not have any problem getting whatever requisites I’d need.
Even today, so many decades later, it feels as though the Triple Gem continues to provide for me.
All satisfaction of my material needs seems to manifest eventually, without any struggle.
One day an older monk asked me to shave his head.
That was a common practice in the monastery, but I had never shaved anyone’s head, not even my own.
I told him this, but he insisted. “It’s time you learned,” he said.
Head-shaving is an important part of the Buddhist monastic discipline.
Both monks and nuns do it.
A shaved head promotes cleanliness and humility and it avoids the problem of having to kill head lice! It is also a symbol of renunciation and is intended to decrease monks’ and nuns’ attachment to physical beauty.
If monks and nuns don’t have to spend time washing, combing, and fixing their hair, they’re free to spend more time on spiritual pursuits.
The Vinaya, or monastic code of conduct, says that monks and nuns can keep their hair as long as two inches.
Some shave their heads only once a month, usually right before the full-moon day.
Others shave once a week, or even every day.
The ritual is so important that a straight razor is one of eight items included in a bundle of possessions that a monastic receives at his or her ordination.

When the older monk insisted that I shave his head, I bowed and agreed, as tradition demanded.
I wet his head, slathered soap on it, and took hold of the razor.
Standing behind him, I dragged the blade against his scalp and an inch-long flap of skin lifted away from his skull! In the next instant there was blood everywhere.
I was so scared I started to shake.
“Venerable Sir, please forgive me,” I said, and then ran to find another monk, who brought cool water to wash the wound.
While I watched in shame and panic, that monk shaved the rest of the unfortunate fellow’s head.
We of course had no Band-Aids in those days, so the wounded monk went on alms round with a large dab of herbal salve on his head.
Because of my photographic memory, I sped through my studies.
Sinhalese, Pali, and Sanskrit were mandatory subjects.
Tamil, Hindi, and English were optional.
Without much effort, I mastered them all.
As a reward, I was finally allowed to live in the dormitory with the other students despite my continued inability to pay the lodging fee.
I was assigned to a room with another novice monk.
Unfortunately, my roommate was jealous of me.
One day I went to pull out a thin English textbook I had borrowed from someone and found it ripped in two.
I was worried about how I would pay for replacing the book and started to cry.
A monk in the next room heard me sniffling and offered to help by buying another book.
A couple of days later, my roommate confessed that he had torn up the book because he was jealous of my popularity and of how well I did in school.
We cleared the air between us that evening and eventually became good friends.
Eventually, the date of my higher ordination was set.
It would take place June 25, 1947.
I was very excited and happy.
Finally I would become a full bhikkhu, my goal at long last coming true.
Before a solemn assemblage of senior monks, I would pledge a new and deeper commitment.
Instead of being a novice monk following ten precepts, I would now agree to follow 227 precepts — the code of conduct that governs full-fledged Theravada Buddhist monks.
I could hardly wait.
Sadly, right from the beginning, there was a shadow over the proceedings.
The problem was not my eligibility to become a monk, but rather the politics of the Buddhist Sangha in Ceylon.
Those politics threatened to derail the dream I had held all my life.
CHAPTER SIX. Higher Ordination
IN SRI LANKA, there are three major sects of Theravada Buddhism.
The oldest and largest, to which I belong, is Siyam Nikaya.
This sect has more monks and temples than the other sects.
It also has the most ancient temples in the country.
Its name, Siyam, dates back to a time when the Sangha, or order of monks, had dwindled to its lowest numbers due to British rule in Ceylon, and because of Dutch and Portuguese missionaries.
There were many novices, but not a single bhikkhu left who had received higher ordination and was observing the 227 precepts — and thus could ordain others.
A novice Ceylonese monk traveled to Siam, as Thailand was then called , to receive higher ordination as a full bhikkhu.
Then he returned to Ceylon and reestablished the order of monks in 1753.
Only the highest caste members of society in Ceylon, called Goyigama, were allowed full ordination into the Siyam Nikaya order.
My family, though poor, belonged to this caste.
In Ceylon, caste was not based on wealth but on family lineage.
Years later, a group of non-Goyigama novice monks traveled to Amarapura, in Burma, and received full ordination there.
That group returned to Ceylon and founded the Amarapura Nikaya sect in 1800.
A third sect, founded in 1810 by monks who went to the Ramanna district of Burma, became the Ramanna Nikaya sect.
Originally there was a great deal of rivalry between the sects.
Each one thought the others were not strict enough in their interpretation of the Vinaya, or code of conduct for sangha members.
Siyam Nikaya monks, for example, shaved their eyebrows as well as their heads.
Members of the other sects did not.
On the other hand, when leaving their temples, Siyam Nikaya monks were allowed to leave one shoulder bare when they draped their robes around them.
Monks of the other sects covered both shoulders.
My teacher, Venerable Sonuttara, belonged to the Siyam Nikaya sect.
His teacher was a disciple of the sect’s supreme patriarch, Most Venerable Pahamune Sumangala.
In 1911, when he was twenty-five years old, my teacher was sent to open a temple in Malandeniya village.
Immediately there was trouble with the head monk at the temple in the next village, Kebilitigoda.
The temple in Kebilitigoda had already existed for ten years before my teacher arrived in Malandeniya.
Even so, the head monk became jealous of my teacher, so he made a legal claim to the new temple’s property.
As a result, my teacher had to pay tribute to the monk in Kebilitigoda and visit every day to pay respects.
As it turns out, that monk in Kebilitigoda was Venerable Sumanatissa, who had given me novice vows when I was thirteen.
He could have “claimed” me then as his student, but he didn’t.
I guess I didn’t seem like a particularly promising monk at that point.
Over the years, animosity festered between the two temples.
And when time came for my higher ordination in 1947, I ran headlong into the dispute.
According to tradition, when a novice monk is about to receive higher ordination, an announcement of the ceremony is sent to friends, relatives, temple attendees, and all other temples where that novice has lived.
It is printed on cheap paper and is mailed or delivered by hand.
The principal of the monks’ school wrote my announcement, and according to tradition, I took it to my teacher to have him sign it.
For some reason, Venerable Sonuttara was reluctant to sign his name as head of the temple in Malandeniya.
“But you started this temple in 1911,” I said to him.
“You built it and you have always been the only monk living here.
Who else could be head of the temple?”
Venerable Sonuttara said nothing and finally signed the paper.
I made copies and hand-delivered the first one to Venerable Sumanatissa, my original preceptor, at the temple in the neighboring village.
As soon as he saw my teacher’s signature as head monk of the other temple, he became enraged.
“Venerable Sonuttara is not head monk at that temple,” he thundered.
“I am! And I am not even listed here as one of your teachers.”
He immediately went to the Siyam Nikaya headquarters in Kandy and requested that my ordination be canceled.
My teacher and I were dismayed, but we continued to get ready for the ceremony, hoping the dispute would somehow be resolved.
On the night before my ordination, as was custom, the people of Malandeniya had arranged a large procession and reception at the temple in my honor.
Even though Venerable Sumanatissa was threatening to stop the procession, it went ahead without a problem.
The next day, June 25, we went to Kandy.
The ordination ritual would take place in the sima, a consecrated building on the grounds of the Siyam Nikaya headquarters.
On that day, twenty-six novices, including me, were scheduled to receive higher ordination.
Our relatives, friends, and well-wishers had already gathered in the sima.
As I had feared, Venerable Sumanatissa wasn’t going to let this pass.
He entered a formal complaint against my ordination because he, not my teacher, was the head of the temple in Malandeniya.
Therefore, my teacher had no right to sign his name in the ordination register as “head monk.
” Venerable Sumanatissa insisted my teacher sign his name only as “resident monk.”
My teacher, Venerable Sonuttara, was an uneducated man and was not clever with words.
He was afraid to oppose any monk who was his senior.
But most of all, he didn’t want this dispute to ruin my chances of being ordained.
I was angry at Venerable Sumanatissa, both for being harsh with my teacher and for trying to spoil the most important day of my life.
I found the politics of the whole thing appalling, but there was nothing I could do about it.
Without a word of argument, my teacher signed the register as Venerable Sumanatissa demanded, with the words “resident monk” beside his name.
A few hours before the ceremony, two senior monks dressed me all in white, with a crown-like headdress.
If a candidate has wealthy relatives or supporters, he might ride on an elephant, the symbol of majesty and status.
He might also have hundreds of people following, beating drums, blowing conchs and flutes, and dancing.
Because my family was not wealthy, my ceremony was more humble.
While I was being dressed, my relatives and teachers had prepared trays of gifts for members of the ordination committee.
Each tray contained betel and areca nuts for chewing, tobacco for smoking, a towel, a bar of soap, toothpaste, a toothbrush made from a small twig, and a box of cookies.
There were twenty dignitaries in attendance: the supreme patriarch of the Siyam Nikaya sect; his two assistants, who were also very senior and respected; a secretary monk, who maintained all records for the sect; and sixteen others.
Following a strict hierarchy, I was to go to each monk at his kuti, in turn, and present him with a gift tray.
This ritual took about an hour.
Even though it might seem redundant, every candidate for higher ordination is reordained as a novice and dressed in a new, bright yellow robe in the last hours before he becomes a bhikkhu.
This reminds the aspirant, once again, of Siddhattha’s renunciation of his princely life, wrapping himself in a yellow cloth when he took up the life of a mendicant.
It also serves to “wipe clean the slate,” in case the aspiring monk had broken any precepts during his novicehood and had failed to confess them to his teacher.
At 6 P.M. the ceremony began.
A rope divided the sima in half — one side for monks, the other for laypeople.
The laypeople’s side was packed with hundreds of noisy guests.
Children played with one another, babies cried, and adults chatted and laughed.
At the far end of the assembly hall was a large Buddha statue.
It sat on a dark wooden altar with peeling paint that was crowded with devotional candles and small earthen lamps, smoking incense burners, vases of flowers, and small cups filled with fruit juice, tea, or water.
A flat tray held the traditional betel chewing mixture.
A pair of large brass oil lamps flanked the altar, casting a sputtering light against the serene face of the Buddha.
At the right of the statue sat the supreme patriarch, flanked by his two assistants.
The remaining monks on the ordination committee sat on the wooden floor, in lines facing each other.
We novices were asked to sit on the floor according to our ages.
At six months shy of twenty, I was the youngest.
Twenty is the minimum age at which a novice may take higher ordination, but because I had completed all other requirements, I was allowed to ordain six months early.
The first order of business was an oral examination in which a senior monk would ask the novices, one by one, to recite stanzas and answer questions.
The examiner that evening was the second-ranking monk, a man known to be very strict.
His method was to recite the first line of a stanza from the Buddhist texts, then ask the candidate to finish it.
Most of the other novices had memorized the minimum number of stanzas required.
I, with my photographic memory and eagerness to excel, had memorized many more.
Even so, I was nervous in front of the large crowd.
Finally, after twenty-five other novices, my turn came.
The examiner had been at work for an hour and a half and he looked exhausted.
He asked me to recite a stanza from the Dhammapada.
I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and recited eight stanzas without stopping.
“That is enough,” the examiner said.
“You have studied well.”
Next, each of the novices had to be formally accepted as candidates for ordination.
Like the others before me, I got up and stood in front of one of the committee monks.
Methodically, he questioned me: my name; my gender; my parents’ names; my teacher’s name; whether I had any contagious diseases; whether I was a soldier or a free man; and even a question about whether I was human or demon.
While mostly a formality, these questions were intended to confirm that I was not a criminal trying to escape the law by hiding in the robe.
The question about contagious diseases was to make sure that I had no illness that might sweep through the community of monks.
The other questions, more quaint, were traditional queries dating back to the time of the Buddha.
After I answered all his questions, this monk announced to the supreme patriarch that I was a suitable candidate for ordination.
I knelt before the patriarch and bowed, touching my head to the floor in front of him three times.
Again I answered the series of questions, this time with the patriarch listening.
Then I was told to sit with my fellow novices.
Two monks lectured us on the importance of the 227 disciplinary rules we would have to follow after our ordination, emphasizing the four main rules: not to have sexual intercourse; not to take anything not explicitly given to us; not to kill; and not to boast of supernatural attainments.
There was also a reminder about cultivating nonattachment to the four requisites provided by laypeople: robes, food, lodging, and medicine.
All this advice came from the original words of the Buddha to his disciples.
Finally, with our new alms bowls hanging from cords around our necks, we bowed before each of the committee members, starting with the patriarch.
Then we sat down in long rows, and all the laypeople filed by to present us with gifts.
This is a very joyous part of the ceremony.
It emphasizes the interdependent relationship between the monastic Sangha and laypeople.
Many people cried as they bowed and laid their gifts before us.
This presentation of offerings is one of the most beautiful aspects of Buddhism and is sometimes misunderstood by outside observers who conclude that bhikkhus are lazy beggars, supported by a gullible populace.
In fact, it is quite the opposite: The givers receive as much, if not more, than the recipients because they are practicing dana, or generosity.
Anyone who gives gifts is practicing generosity.
The Buddha found this practice to be a good method for removing greed and attachment.
In many of his discourses, he urged Buddhists to practice dana whenever and wherever possible:
Just as a pot filled with water,
If overturned by anyone,
Pours out all its water
And does not hold any back.
Even so, when you see those in need,
Whether low, middle, or high,
Then give like the overturned pot,
Holding nothing back.
In another sermon, the Buddha taught that there are three ways of making merit.
Those three ways are virtuous behavior, meditation, and generosity.
The expression of generosity between laypeople and monastics is very much a reciprocal arrangement.
The laypeople offer requisites that allow the bhikkhus to walk their spiritual path without having to worry about mundane necessities.
In return, the monastics offer blessings, as well as teachings — the gift of the Dhamma.
During my ordination, as the gifts slowly piled up on the floor before me, I sat there and thought of my mother.
How I wished she could have witnessed this ceremony! I knew how much it would have meant to her, how much it would have meant to me to have her there.
But because of her back injury, she couldn’t walk the nine miles from our village, and there was no other way for her to make the trip.
If she had been there that day in Kandy, she would have surely shed tears of joy, seeing her youngest son at last become a fully ordained monk.
