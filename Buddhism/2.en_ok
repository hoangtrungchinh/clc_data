Soon after Mindfulness in Plain English was published, several of my friends and students asked me to write a book about the Buddha’s path to happiness in the same straightforward style.
This book is my response.
Mindfulness in Plain English was a meditation manual, a guide for students in the practice of mindfulness meditation.
Mindfulness can much improve our lives, but the Buddha offered more.
He gave us a complete guide to happiness, which he summed up in eight steps.
Even a little effort to incorporate these eight steps into your life will yield happiness.
Strong effort will transform you and bring you the happiest and most exalted states achievable.
The eight steps of the Buddha’s path are easy enough to memorize, but their meaning is deep and requires an understanding of many related topics of the Buddha’s teachings.
Even those familiar with the Eightfold Path may not see how central it is to the whole teaching or how it fits their experience.
As in Mindfulness in Plain English , I have tried to present this teaching plainly, so that anybody can practice the eight steps in their daily life.
I recommend that you do not read this book as you would a novel or the newspaper.
Rather, while reading, continually ask yourself, “Am I happy?” and investigate what you find.
The Buddha invited the people he taught to come and see.
He invited all of us to look at ourselves, to come home, to come close to our own bodies and minds and examine them.
Don’t get lost in beliefs and suppositions about the world, he told us; try to find out what is really going on.
We are good at accumulating information, gathering data.
Perhaps you have picked up this book to gather more information.
If you have been reading popular Buddhist books, stop and ask yourself what you hope to get from this one.
Do you just want to impress people with how well you know Buddhism?
Do you hope to gain happiness through intellectual knowledge of the teachings?
Knowledge alone will not help you find happiness.
If you read what follows with the willingness to put the Buddha’s path to happiness into practice—to actually try out his advice, rather than just get an intellectual impression—then the profound simplicity of the Buddha’s message will become clear.
Gradually, the full truth of all things will be revealed to you.
And gradually you will discover the lasting happiness that full knowledge of the truth can give you.
If you get upset by things that you read in Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness , then investigate why.
Look within.
Ask yourself what is currently happening in your mind.
If something you read makes you miserable, ask yourself why.
Sometimes we feel uncomfortable when someone points out how unskillful we are.
You may have a lot of bad habits and other obstacles that keep you from greater happiness.
Do you want to learn about them and make some changes?
So often we get upset by some tiny little thing and then blame it on someone—a friend, secretary, boss, neighbor, child, sibling, parent, the government.
Or we get disappointed when we don’t get what we want or lose something we value.
We carry within our minds certain “psychic irritants”—sources of suffering—that are triggered by events or our thoughts.
Then we suffer, and we try to stop the pain by changing the world.
There’s an old story about a man who wanted to cover the whole earth with leather so he could walk more comfortably.
He would have found it much easier to make a pair of sandals.
Similarly, instead of trying to control the world to make yourself happy, work to reduce your psychic irritants.
But you must actually train yourself, not just read or think about it.
Even meditating won’t get you far if you do not practice the entire path—especially its key aspects of developing right understanding, making strong, discerning effort, and practicing continuous mindfulness.
I heard that a student of mine was walking down the street while reading a copy of Mindfulness in Plain English .
He wasn’t being mindful of where he was, and he was hit by a car!
The Buddha’s invitation to come and see asks you to personalize what you read here.
Put the Buddha’s eight steps into practice, even while you are reading.
Don’t let your misery blindside you.
Even if you read this book a hundred times, it won’t help you unless you put what’s written here into practice.
But this book surely will help you if you practice sincerely, investigate your unhappiness fearlessly, and commit yourself to doing whatever it takes to reach lasting happiness.
Rapid technological advances.
Increased wealth.
Stable lives and careers come under the pressure of accelerating change.
The twenty-first century?
No, the sixth century B.C.—a time of destructive warfare, economic dislocation, and widespread disruption of established patterns of life, just like today.
In conditions similar to ours, the Buddha discovered a path to lasting happiness.
His discovery—a step-by-step method of mental training to achieve contentment—is as relevant today as ever.
Putting the Buddha’s discovery into practice is no quick fix.
It can take years.
The most important qualification at the beginning is a strong desire to change your life by adopting new habits and learning to see the world anew.
Mindfulness is a way of training yourself to become aware of things as they really are.
With mindfulness as your watchword, you progress through the eight steps laid down by the Buddha more than twenty-five hundred years ago—a gentle, gradual training in how to end dissatisfaction.
Tragedy, grief, disappointment, physical pain, melancholy, loneliness, resentment, the nagging feeling that there could be something better.
These happen too, don’t they?
Our fragile happiness depends on things happening a certain way.
But there is something else: a happiness not dependent on conditions.
The Buddha taught the way to find this perfect happiness.
If you are willing to do whatever it takes to find your way out of suffering—and it means confronting the roots of resistance and craving right here, right now—you can reach complete success.
Even if you are a casual reader, you can benefit from these teachings, so long as you are willing to use those that make sense to you.
If you know something to be true, don’t ignore it.
Act on it!
That may sound easy, but nothing is more difficult.
When you admit to yourself, “I must make this change to be more happy”—not because the Buddha said so, but because your heart recognizes a deep truth—you must devote all your energy to making the change.
You need strong determination to overcome harmful habits.
Let’s get started.
We’ll begin by looking at what happiness is, why it’s so elusive, and how to start journeying on the Buddha’s path toward it.
The desire to be happy is age-old, yet happiness has always eluded us.
What does it mean to be happy?
We often seek an experience of sensual pleasure, such as eating something tasty or watching a fun movie, for the happiness it will bring us.
But is there a happiness beyond the fleeting enjoyment of a pleasurable experience?
Some people try to string together as many enjoyable experiences as they can and call that a happy life.
Others sense the limits of sensual indulgence and seek a more lasting happiness with material comforts, family life, and security.
Yet these sources of happiness also have limitations.
Throughout the world many people live with the pain of hunger; their basic needs for clothing and shelter go unmet; they endure the constant threat of violence.
Understandably, these people believe that increased material comfort will bring them lasting happiness.
In the United States the unequal distribution of wealth leaves many in poverty, but the starvation and deprivation commonly found in much of the world is rare.
The standard of living of most U.S. citizens is luxurious.
So people elsewhere assume that Americans must be among the happiest on earth.
But if they were to come to the United States, what would they see?
They would notice that Americans are constantly busy—rushing to appointments, talking on cell phones, shopping for groceries or for clothes, working long hours in an office or in a factory.
Why all this frantic activity?
The answer is simple.
Although Americans seem to have everything, they are still unhappy.
And they are puzzled by this.
How can they have close, loving families, good jobs, fine homes, enough money, richly varied lives—and still not feel happy?
Unhappiness, they believe, results from the lack of such things.
Possessions, social approval, the love of friends and family, and a wealth of pleasurable experiences ought to make people happy.
Why, then, do Americans, like people everywhere, so often experience misery instead?
It seems that the very things that we think should make people happy are in fact sources of misery.
They do not last.
Relationships end, investments fail, people lose their jobs, kids grow up and move away, and the sense of well-being gained from costly possessions and pleasurable experiences is fleeting at best.
Change is all around us, threatening the very things we think we need to be happy.
People today are ever more sophisticated in their needs, it’s true, but no matter how many expensive and beautiful things they collect, they want more.
Modern culture reinforces this wanting.
What you really need to be happy, as every TV ad and billboard proclaims, is this shiny new car, this superfast computer, this gorgeous vacation in Hawaii.
And it seems to work, briefly.
People confuse the buzz of excitement gained from a new possession or a pleasurable experience with happiness.
But all too soon they’re itching again.
The suntan fades, the new car gets a scratch, and they’re longing for another shopping spree.
This incessant scrambling to the mall keeps them from discovering the source of true happiness.
The Buddha lumped together almost everything that most of us call happiness in the lowest category.
He called it the “happiness of sensual pleasures.” We could also call it the “happiness of favorable conditions” or the “happiness of clinging.”
Let us look more closely at this happiness of sensual pleasures.
Its lowest form is the wholehearted indulgence in pleasure from any of the five physical senses.
At its worst, overindulgence can lead to debauchery, depravity, and addiction.
It’s easy to see that indulging the senses is not happiness, because the pleasure disappears almost immediately and may even leave people feeling wretched or remorseful.
The Buddha once explained that as one matures spiritually, one comes to understand that there is more to life than pleasure through the five senses.
He used the metaphor of a tender little baby tied down by thin strings in five places: both wrists, both ankles, and the throat.
Worldly happiness, however, goes beyond sense indulgence.
It includes the joys of reading, watching a good movie, and other forms of mental stimulation or entertainment.
It also includes the wholesome joys of this world such as helping people, maintaining a stable family and raising children, and earning an honest living.
The Buddha mentioned a few of these more satisfying forms of happiness.
One is the happy, secure feeling you get from possessing wealth earned through honest, hard work.
You enjoy your wealth with a clear conscience and no fear of abuse or revenge.
Better than this is the satisfaction of both enjoying the wealth that you earned honestly and also sharing it with others.
Another especially gratifying form of happiness comes from reflecting that one is completely free of any kind of debt to anyone.
Most of us, even the most discerning, view these things as the essence of a good life.
Because they depend on conditions being right.
Though less fleeting than the transient pleasures of sensual indulgence, and less potentially destructive to long-term happiness, they are unstable.
The more we trust them, seek them, and try to hang on to them, the more we suffer.
Our efforts will create painful mental agitation and ultimately prove futile; conditions inevitably will change.
No matter what we do, our hearts will break.
There are better, more stable sources of happiness.
One of them is the “happiness of renunciation,” the spiritual happiness that comes from seeking something beyond worldly pleasures.
The classic example is the joy that comes from dropping all worldly concerns and seeking solitude in peaceful surroundings to pursue spiritual development.
Generosity is a powerful form of renunciation.
Generously sharing what we have, and many other acts of renunciation, make us feel happy.
There is a sense of pleasure and relief every time we let go.
It stands to reason that if we can let go completely of grasping at anything in the world, then this great relinquishment will bring even more happiness than occasional acts of renunciation.
Higher than relinquishment of material things is the “happiness of letting go of psychic irritants.” This kind of happiness arises naturally when we work with the mind to quickly let go of anger, desire, attachment, jealousy, pride, confusion, and other mental irritations every time they occur.
Nipping them in the bud allows the mind to become unobstructed, joyful, bright, and clear.
Yet there is no guarantee that the negativities will stay away and stop irritating the mind.
Even better is the refined pleasure and happiness of the various states of deep concentration.
No sorrow can arise in these states.
Powerful and transcendent as these states of concentration can be, however, they have one big drawback: the meditator must emerge from them eventually.
Being impermanent, even states of profound concentration must come to an end.
The highest happiness is the bliss of attaining stages of enlightenment.
With each stage, our load in life is lightened, and we feel greater happiness and freedom.
The final stage of enlightenment, permanent freedom from all negative states of mind, brings uninterrupted, sublime happiness.
The Buddha recommended that we learn to let go of our attachments to the lower forms of happiness and focus all of our efforts upon finding the very highest form of happiness, enlightenment.
But he also urged people to maximize their happiness at whatever level they can.
For those of us who cannot see beyond the happiness based on the sense pleasures, he offered sage advice for avoiding worldly troubles and for finding optimal worldly happiness, for example, by cultivating qualities leading to material success or a satisfying family life.
For those with the higher ambition to be reborn in blissful realms, he explained just how to accomplish that goal.
For those interested in reaching the highest goal of full enlightenment, he taught how to achieve it.
But whichever kind of happiness we are seeking, we make use of the steps of the Eightfold Path.
The Buddha knew that the relentless search for happiness in pleasurable worldly conditions traps us in an endless cycle of cause and effect, attraction and aversion.
Each thought and word and deed is a cause that leads to an effect, which in turn becomes a cause.
Pointing out how the cycle of unhappiness works, the Buddha said:
Suddenly you realize that someone else has stopped at the display and is admiring this pie.
Seized with stinginess, you snatch it up and hurry to the checkout while the other shopper glares.
In the unlikely event that the other shopper were to follow you into the parking lot and try to take your pie, imagine what unwholesome actions might take place—insults probably, maybe a shoving match.
But even if there is no direct confrontation, your actions have caused another person to develop negative thoughts and to see you as a greedy person.
Your contented state of mind has also been destroyed.
Once craving arises in the mind, selfish and stingy behavior is usually inevitable.
In our drive for any kind of small pleasure—a piece of strawberry pie—we may act rudely and risk making an enemy.
When the craving is for something major, such as someone’s valuables or an adulterous sexual contact, the stakes are much higher, and serious violence and endless suffering may result.
If we can reverse this cycle, starting from our negative behavior and moving backward step by step to its emotional and mental causes, we may be able to eliminate our unhappiness at its source.
It only makes sense that when our craving and grasping is wiped out—completely eradicated—happiness is assured.
We may have no idea how to accomplish such a feat, but when we recognize what we have to do, we have started our journey.
Now you see why we say that true happiness comes only from eliminating craving.
Even if we think that attaining the highest happiness is unrealistic, we will still benefit from reducing craving.
The more we let go of craving, the greater our sense of happiness.
But how do we reduce craving?
The idea of lessening craving—much less eradicating it—may seem daunting.
If you think that making the effort to force craving out of existence by sheer willpower will end in frustration, you are correct.
The Buddha came up with a better way: the gradual training of the Eightfold Path.
The Buddha’s path of gradual development impacts every aspect of your life.
The process begins at any point, at any time.
You start wherever you are and move forward, step by step.
Each new wholesome change in behavior or understanding builds upon the last.
Among the crowds of people who heard the Buddha teach, some had such receptive minds that they achieved lasting happiness after hearing his step-by-step instructions in a single discourse.
A few were so ready that upon hearing only the highest teaching—the Four Noble Truths—their minds were completely freed.
But most of the Buddha’s disciples had to work their way through the teachings, mastering each step before moving on to the next.
Some disciples took years to work through obstacles in their understanding before they could move on to the next level of inquiry.
Most of us must do a lot of personal work to disentangle ourselves from years of destructive and self-defeating attitudes and behavior.
We must work slowly along the Buddha’s path of gradual training with much patience and encouragement.
Not everybody gets full understanding overnight.
We all bring differences from our past experiences and the intensity of our dedication to spiritual growth.
The Buddha was a profoundly skillful teacher.
He knew that we need some basic clarity before we can absorb the higher teachings.
His Eightfold Path to happiness consists of three stages that build upon each other: morality, concentration, and wisdom.
The first stage, morality, consists of adopting a core set of values and living our lives according to them.
The Buddha knew that thinking, speaking, and acting in ethical ways are preliminary steps to take before progressing to higher spiritual development.
But of course we must have at least some wisdom to discern what is ethical.
Thus he began his teaching by helping us to cultivate a basic level of Skillful Understanding and Skillful Thinking .
These mental skills help us distinguish between moral and immoral thoughts and actions, between wholesome behaviors and those which hurt us and those around us.
As we develop the right mind-set, we can begin to put our evolving understanding to work by practicing Skillful Speech , Skillful Action , and Skillful Livelihood .
These practical steps of good moral conduct help make our minds receptive, free from hindrances, elated, and confident.
As the distractions that come from destructive behavior begin to fade away, concentration can arise.
Concentration has three steps.
The first is Skillful Effort , which brings mental focus to every other step of the path.
Such effort is especially necessary if many unwholesome thoughts spring into awareness when one sits down to meditate.
Next is Skillful Mindfulness .
To have mindfulness there must be some wholesome concentration at every moment, so that the mind can keep in touch with changing objects.
Skillful Concentration allows us to focus the mind on one object or idea without interruption.
Because it is a positive state of mind, free from anger or greed, concentration gives us the mental intensity we need to see deeply into the truth of our situation.
With morality as the foundation, concentration arises.
Out of concentration, the third stage of the Buddha’s path—wisdom—develops.
This brings us back to the first two steps of the path: Skillful Understanding and Skillful Thinking.
We begin to experience “aha!” insights into our behavior.
We see how we create our own unhappiness.
We see how our thoughts, words, and deeds have hurt ourselves and others.
We see right through our lies and face our life as it truly is.
Wisdom is the bright light that shows us the way out of the tangle of our unhappiness.
Though I have presented the Buddha’s path as a series of sequential stages, it actually works more like a spiral.
Morality, concentration, and wisdom reinforce and deepen each other.
Each of the eight steps on the path deepens and reinforces the others.
As you begin to practice the path as a whole, each step unfolds, and each wholesome action or insight gives impetus to the next.
Along the way, everything about you changes, especially your tendency to blame others for your unhappiness.
With each turn of the spiral, you accept more responsibility for your intentional thoughts, words, and deeds.
For instance, as you apply your increasing wisdom to understanding moral conduct, you see the value of ethical thought and behavior more profoundly and are led to make even more sweeping changes in the way you act.
Similarly, as you see more clearly which mental states are helpful and which you should abandon, you apply effort more skillfully, with the result that your concentration deepens and your wisdom grows.
As you get started on the Buddha’s path, you will naturally wish to modify your lifestyle and attitudes to support your practice.
Do not be dismayed; some of these suggestions present great challenges that you may work with for quite a long time.
A good place to begin is by honestly assessing your habitual daily activities.
Look also at how you spend your time.
Make a habit of asking yourself, “Is this task or behavior really necessary or is it just a way to be busy?” If you can reduce or eliminate some activities, you will achieve greater peace and quiet, which is essential to advancing in the training.
Right now you may have many responsibilities to your family or others who depend upon you.
This is good, but be careful not to sacrifice opportunities to calm your mind and develop insight.
Helping others is important, but as the Buddha stated clearly, tending to your own development is a priority.
Cultivate the inclination to spend time each day in solitude and silence, rather than always being in the company of others.
If all your time is spent with other people, it’s easy to get caught up in unnecessary activities and conversations.
That makes it harder to maintain a contemplative practice.
No matter where you live, if you wish to deepen your understanding and wisdom, from time to time get away from your commitments and spend time alone.
Of course, outer quiet is not always enough.
Even in a quiet and solitary place, we sometimes find ourselves besieged by anger, jealousy, fear, tension, anxiety, greed, and confusion.
We’ve also experienced times when our minds are completely quiet and peaceful despite all the commotion around us.
The Buddha explained this paradox.
If we have little attachment and craving, he said, we can live in solitude in the midst of a crowd.
We can let go of our sense of possession and ownership.
Our loved ones, our possessions, our jobs, our obligations and ties, our views and opinions—all these we cling to.
As we reduce our grasping, we move closer to inner freedom, the essence of solitude.
Some people may find that traditional rituals help them calm the mind and remind them of what is really important.
You and your family can chant together, light incense or a candle, or offer flowers to a Buddha image every day.
These simple, beautiful practices will not bring enlightenment, but they can be useful tools to prepare the mind for a daily mindfulness practice.
A well-disciplined life can also be a source of happiness.
Take a good look at your physical surroundings.
If your bedroom is strewn with dirty laundry, if your desk is a jumble of books, papers, computer disks, and old magazines, and if last week’s dishes are still in the sink, how will you be able to organize your mind?
Practice develops from the outside in.
Clean up your house first and then move inside to sweep away the dust of attachment, hatred, and ignorance.
Practice also benefits from a healthy body.
Yoga and other forms of physical exercise contribute to our mental health.
At least take a long walk each day.
Walking is both good exercise and an opportunity to practice mindfulness in solitude and silence.
A healthy and moderate diet also supports spiritual practice.
Eating a good breakfast, a reasonably substantial lunch, and a light supper will make you feel comfortable the next morning.
There is an old saying, “Eat your breakfast like a king, share your lunch with your friend, and give your dinner to your enemy.”
Junk food, alcohol, coffee, and other stimulants make it more difficult to concentrate.
Eat to live, don’t live to eat.
Try not to make eating a mindless habit.
Some practitioners engage in an occasional fast, which quickly demonstrates that much of what we think of as hunger is really just habit.
Finally, discipline yourself to meditate every day.
A session of meditation in the morning as soon as you get up and in the evening before you go to bed will help you progress.
If you find that you are unable to maintain a regular practice, ask yourself why.
Perhaps you doubt the importance of meditation, or fear that it will not help you solve your problems.
Examine your doubts and fears carefully.
Read the life stories of the Buddha and others who have used meditation to achieve permanent happiness.
Remember that you alone can change your life for the better and that meditation has proven effective for countless others.
Then apply a bit of self-control, especially at the beginning, to maintain the discipline of regular, daily meditation.
Generosity is taught in every religious tradition, but it is a natural state of mind that all living beings possess inherently.
Even animals share their food.
When you are generous, you feel happy, and you delight in remembering the recipient’s joy.
Also practice patience.
Being patient does not mean giving someone free rein to abuse you.
It means biding your time and expressing yourself effectively at the right time, at the right place, with the right words and the right attitude.
If you impatiently blurt out something, you may regret what you say and cause pain.
Patience also means trying to understand others as best you can.
Misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and suspicion cause pain and dissatisfaction.
Remember that others have as many problems as you—maybe more.
Some very good people are sometimes in a bad place and may say or do things unmindfully.
If you remain patient in spite of provocation, you can avoid getting upset, and your understanding of the human situation will deepen.
Try not to blame others for your pain or expect others to make you happy.
Look within, discover why you are unhappy, and find a way to be content.
Unhappy people tend to make others unhappy.
But if you’re surrounded by unhappy people, you can maintain your peace of mind by keeping your mind as clear as possible—and your patience and understanding might cheer them up.
Finally, have faith in your potential for lasting happiness.
This includes confidence in your religious teaching, in yourself, in your work, in your friends, and in the future.
Faith or confidence leads to an optimistic attitude to life.
You can increase your confidence through examining your own experience.
You already have evidence of your many abilities.
Have faith as well in those you have not yet manifested.
A good meditation center and a meditation teacher who is sincerely willing to assist you are important aids.
You don’t want a teacher who requires submission or promises magical powers.
You are looking for someone who knows more than you, whose life is exemplary, and with whom you can develop a long-term relationship.
The Buddha’s path may take several years—in some cases, several lifetimes.
Choose your guide wisely.
The Buddha described the perfect teacher as “a good friend.” Such a person speaks gently, kindly, and earnestly, respects you, and is caring and compassionate.
A good friend never asks you to do anything wrong, but always encourages you to do the right thing and helps whenever you need assistance.
A good friend is learned and resourceful, ready to share knowledge with you without hesitation.
Just as a master craftsman trains apprentices, not just in the techniques of the craft, but also in the personal characteristics needed to apply those skills, so, too, a good teacher both guides your practice and helps you make the lifestyle changes necessary to support it.
If you are really seeking happiness, take the time and make the effort to apprentice yourself to such a master.
Next, follow the course of gradual training that the Buddha prescribed.
The gradual training essentially involves learning how to quiet down and observe your thoughts and behavior and then to change them into something more conducive to meditation and awareness.
It is a slow process, not to be hurried.
One reason why so many people drop meditation is that they haven’t taken the time to lay the foundation for effective practice.
Finally, make time to read and discuss the Buddha’s teachings.
Books are readily available, as are discussion groups and classes.
You can even talk about the Buddha’s message online and via email lists.
Reading about and discussing the Buddha’s teachings is never a waste of time.
While these requirements for progress might seem obvious, very few of us live quietly, eat moderately, exercise regularly, and live simply.
Even fewer study with a qualified teacher, discuss the Buddha’s teachings regularly, and meditate daily.
This emphasis on simplicity and moderation does not mean that you cannot start to follow the Buddha’s path right now, whatever your lifestyle.
It simply tells you what you may need to do over a period of years—or even lifetimes—in order to advance toward the highest happiness.
Mindfulness is a unique method of cultivating moment-by-moment awareness of the true nature of everything experienced through the body and mind.
You may have heard it called “vipassana meditation.” It is a skill that you will develop and use throughout every stage of the Buddha’s path to happiness.
Here are some suggestions for beginning a practice of mindfulness meditation.
A good time to start your practice of sitting meditation is early in the morning, before you begin your day’s activities.
A quiet place is preferable, but as there are few noiseless places in the world, choose a place that is congenial for concentration and arrange a comfortable cushion there.
Next, choose a posture for your sitting practice.
The best—but most difficult—posture is the full-lotus.
Your spinal column is straight like a stack of coins, each vertebra atop another.
Your chin is up.
If you cannot sit in the full-lotus posture, try the half-lotus.
Put your right foot over the left thigh , resting your knees on the floor.
Then bend forward and tug the cushion behind.
If touching the floor with your knees is difficult, then rest one thigh on the bend of the other foot.
You may also sit with the left or right lower leg in front of the other on the floor.
Or, you may sit on a small bench, such as those provided in meditation halls.
If all of these are difficult, you may sit on a chair.
After selecting one of these positions, straighten your back and make sure it is perpendicular so your chest can expand easily when you breathe.
Your posture should be natural and supple, not stiff.
Then you want another, and soon it too becomes uncomfortable.
So you go on shifting, moving, changing from one position to another for the whole time you are on the cushion rather than gaining a deeper level of concentration.
Exercise self-control and stay in your original position.
Determine at the start how long you are going to meditate.
If you have never meditated, begin with about twenty minutes.
As you repeat your practice, you can gradually increase your sitting time.
The length of your session depends on how much time you have available and how long you can sit without pain.
When you are seated, close your eyes; this will help you concentrate.
The mind before meditation is like a cup of muddy water.
If you hold the cup still, the mud settles and the water clears.
Similarly, if you keep quiet, holding your body still and focusing your attention on your object of meditation, your mind will settle down and you will begin to experience the joy of meditation.
Suppose you have followed the instructions on posture and are sitting in the most comfortable position.
Soon you realize that your comfort has vanished.
Now there’s pain, and you lose your original determination, your patience, and your enthusiasm for sitting in meditation.
It can be discouraging.
But rest assured that the pain is mostly due to lack of practice.
With practice, it diminishes, and you also find it easier to tolerate.
So let pain become a signal to renew your determination to practice more.
If pain occurs due to a physical defect such as a dislocated disk or a past injury, then you should change your posture—perhaps moving to a bench or a chair.
The most effective but most difficult way to deal with pain is to watch it.
Be with the pain, merge with it.
Experience it without thinking of it as my pain, my knee, my neck.
Simply watch the pain closely and see what happens to it.
At first the pain may increase, which may cause fear.
For example, your knee may begin to hurt so much that you fear you’ll lose your leg—it will get gangrene and have to be amputated—which leads you to wonder how you’ll get by with only one leg.
Don’t worry.
I have never seen anybody lose a leg to meditation!
When that pain that you’re watching comes to its most excruciating point, if you wait patiently for, say, another five minutes, you will see this frightening, life-threatening pain begin to break up.
The pain will change to a neutral sensation, and you will discover that even a painful feeling is impermanent.
You can use a similar technique with psychological pain, perhaps due to some guilt or traumatic memory.
Don’t try to push the pain away.
Welcome it.
Stay with it, even if some awful scenario plays out in your mind.
Without getting lost in the story line, keep watching that psychological pain and see it eventually break up, just like physical pain.
When the breakthrough happens and the pain disappears, you may feel great relief, a peaceful and relaxing calm.
Of course, the body pain or the painful memory may arise again.
And the next time you sit, you’ll probably sit longer before the pain arises.
The second strategy for dealing with pain is to compare it with the pain you have experienced throughout your life.
This present pain, although it seems so difficult now, is only a small portion of the pain you have experienced, and you have endured far worse.
And don’t forget the subtle, background feeling of dissatisfaction that haunts you day and night.
Compared to these other pains, this small pain in your leg is not so great.
It’s worth bearing with it so that you can overcome the greater and more pervasive pains of life.
This pain is like a splinter.
Removing a splinter hurts a lot, yet you accept that hurt to avoid greater pain later on.
In the same way, you can endure the pain of sitting meditation to save yourself from worse troubles in the future.
Another approach is to think of the pain that others are experiencing.
Right now, many people are suffering physical and psychological pain due to sickness, exposure, hunger, separation from loved ones, and other serious problems.
Remind yourself that compared to this misery, your pain is not so bad.
The fourth approach is to ignore the pain.
You deliberately divert your attention to the breath.
To help you stay with the breath, you may breathe quickly several times.
My final suggestion, only when all else fails, is to move—very mindfully.
Slowly shift the muscles to see if the pain can be reduced with a minimum of change to your posture.
If the pain is in your back, note that the back will begin to ache if you have slouched forward.
If tension arises in the back, first make a mental survey of your posture, relax, and then gently straighten the back.
Pain in the ankles and knees needs a special approach, because you do not want to create damaging stress on the tendons.
If you think the pain may come from a tendon, first try mindfully flexing and relaxing the muscles above and below that joint without changing or shifting your posture.
If that does not bring relief, move the leg slowly just enough to alleviate stress on the tendon.
You may wonder what is to be gained from enduring pain.
“I started this practice to get rid of my suffering.
Why should I suffer more in sitting meditation?” Remember, this is the kind of suffering that can lead to the end of all suffering.
When you mindfully observe pain as it arises and disappears and experience the blissful feelings that follow its disappearance, you gain confidence in your ability to withstand pain.
More important, because your experience of pain is voluntary and focused, it is a good training ground.
You break through your resistance to greater pain in life.
Have patience.
Perhaps you have never assumed a meditation posture before, or have done so only occasionally.
Perhaps you are accustomed to sitting on chairs and couches.
Naturally you will feel some pain when you first sit on the floor in meditation.
Have you ever climbed a mountain or ridden a horse?
Remember how the body felt the first time you did it, or how sore it felt the next day?
If you climb mountains or ride horses daily, however, you soon enjoy it pain-free.
It’s the same with meditation: you just have to do it again and again, sitting in the same posture every day.
A good way to settle the mind is to focus on the breath.
The breath is readily available.
You don’t have to work hard to find the breath, for it’s always flowing in and out through the nostrils.
The breath is not involved in any emotion, any reasoning, any choice-making.
Keeping your mind on it is a good way to cultivate a neutral state.
You should begin every sitting meditation session with thoughts of loving-friendliness.
Sometimes people can directly tap into them and send them to all living beings.
More often, you need a method to do so.
Begin with yourself and then slowly expand your thoughts of loving-friendliness to include all living beings.
I recommend reciting the following passage:
May I be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to me; may no difficulties come to me; may no problems come to me; may I always meet with success.
May I also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome the inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.
After reciting this passage, repeat it, replacing the words “I” and “me” with others, beginning with your parents: “May my parents be well, happy, and peaceful.
May no harm come to them…” and so forth.
Next recite this passage for your teachers: “May my teachers be well…”
Then recite it for your relatives; then for your friends; then for “indifferent persons” ; then for your adversaries; and finally for all living beings.
This simple practice will make it easier to gain concentration in meditation and also help you to overcome any resentment that may arise as you sit.
Next take three deep breaths.
As you breathe in and out, notice the expansion and contraction of the lower abdomen, the upper abdomen, and the chest.
Breathe fully to expand these three areas of your body.
After taking three deep breaths, breathe normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly, and gracefully, focusing your attention on the sensation of the breath on the rims of your nostrils.
Most people notice the breath easily at the rims of the nostrils; however, some may prefer to focus on the sensation of the breath touching the upper lip, or in the nose, or in the sinus area, depending on their facial structure.
Having chosen a place of focus, simply notice the feeling of breath going in and out.
When you focus your attention on the breath, you feel the beginning, middle, and end of each inhalation and each exhalation.
You do not have to make any special effort to notice these three stages of breathing.
When one inhalation is complete and before exhaling begins, there is a brief pause.
Notice it, and notice the beginning of the exhalation.
When the exhalation is complete, there is another brief pause before the next inhalation begins.
Notice this brief pause, too.
These two pauses occur so briefly that you may not be aware of them.
But when you are mindful, you can notice them.
At the beginning, perhaps both the inhalation and the exhalation are long.
Notice that, but without thinking or saying “long inhalation, long exhalation.” As you notice the feeling of long inhalations and exhalations, your body becomes relatively calm.
In spite of your efforts to keep focused on your breathing, your mind may wander away.
You may find yourself remembering places you visited, people you met, friends you have not seen for a long time, a book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday.
As soon as you notice that your mind is no longer on your breath, mindfully bring it back and anchor it there.
Some people make use of labeling, which is putting words to phenomena that come up in meditation.
For example, the meditator may notice thoughts and then say mentally, “Thinking, thinking, thinking.” On hearing a sound, the meditator thinks, “Hearing, hearing, hearing.”
I don’t recommend this technique.
The occurrences you may want to label take place so quickly that you have no time to label them.
Labeling takes time—time for the thought to arise or the sensation to occur, time to think of words to conceptualize what you are aware of.
You cannot label something while it is happening.
You can only label something after it has already past.
It is sufficient to watch things as they happen and be aware of them.
Mindfulness teaches you direct awareness.
It helps you to eliminate intermediaries such as concepts and words.
Concepts and words arise after awareness to help you communicate ideas and feelings.
In meditation, however, you’re not expressing anything to anybody.
You’re just knowing that seeing should be limited to seeing, that hearing is hearing, touching is touching, knowing is knowing.
That’s sufficient.
When you get up from your sitting meditation, make a determination to meditate for one minute of every hour throughout the day.
You may wonder what you can do in one minute—that’s hardly time to find your cushion.
Don’t worry about finding a cushion.
Stay where you are, sitting, standing, lying down—it doesn’t matter.
Spend fifty-nine minutes of every hour doing whatever you do during the day.
But for one minute of that hour, stop whatever you are doing and meditate.
You might even set your wristwatch or computer to beep every hour as a reminder.
When you hear the beep, put whatever you have been doing out of your mind and close your eyes.
Stay focused on your breathing.
If you think you won’t know how long a minute is, breathe in and out fifteen times giving undivided attention to the breath.
If you spend longer than a minute, don’t worry about it.
You’re not losing anything.
When the minute is up, before opening your eyes resolve to meditate again for a minute at the end of the next hour.
Look forward to that minute and build up enthusiasm for it.
Also ask yourself, “When am I going to sit and meditate again?”
If you repeat this simple method, by the end of the day, you will have done ten or fifteen minutes of additional meditation.
Moreover, by the end of the day, your wish to sit in meditation—strengthened by your thinking of it every hour—will help you find the motivation to sit for a while before bed.
End your day with half an hour of sitting meditation.
When you go to bed, keep your mind on your breath as you fall asleep.
If you wake up at night, bring your mind to the breath.
When you wake up the next morning, your mind will still be on your breath, reminding you to begin your day with sitting meditation.
Of what results?
You’ll make lots of friends, many will love you, and you’ll feel relaxed and peaceful.
You may wonder, “Is this teaching on dissatisfaction relevant to the modern world in which so many discoveries have made our lives more comfortable?
In the time of the Buddha, people must have suffered from the elements, disease, and natural disasters.
Can we bear that?
When a loved one dies, we experience shock, grief, and loss which can last for years if not forever.
We have already mentioned desire and hatred as strong motivations for our actions, but what does the Buddha mean by ignorance?
And why is it so critical to the dissatisfactions we feel?
Was I pleased!
My sister, who was about seven, came by and rubbed away my circle with her foot.
Why is this so?
Actually, everything in the world exists as the result of a cause.
What if we bought it to remember a special birthday, anniversary, or trip?
Then we’re really attached to it, and its loss or damage saddens us deeply.
“Why don’t we talk about that?
Why don’t we talk about joy, delight, and pleasure instead of dissatisfaction all the time?”
Now, what about this selflessness or soullessness?
What do they have to do with change?
The Buddha taught that the things and beings of this world are selfless or soulless precisely because they are always changing.
With our changing body and our changing feelings, perceptions, thoughts, consciousness, habits, and intentions, how can we point to something and say, “This is mine” or “This is me”?
Even the idea or belief “this is me” changes right away.
Read about the lucky fellow who wins the lottery and lives miserably ever after!
That’s why it is said that there are only two tragedies in life: not getting what one wants, and getting it.
What’s going on here?
Why is it that dissatisfaction touches absolutely every aspect of our lives?
As the Buddha explained, our dissatisfaction comes from how we perceive and think about what we experience.
Where, you might ask, does desire come from?
Most obviously, it comes from the impulses of the body—the desire to stay alive, the desire for food, clothing, shelter, warmth, variety, pleasure.
How many potato chips are enough?
How many pieces of chocolate?
How many video games must you play or novels must you read to fulfill your longing for such experiences?
How much sex would it take for your sexual craving to be satisfied forever?
How much alcohol or drugs?
Did they get enough?
You can always think of some pleasurable thing that you haven’t yet tried.
He might reply, “Darling, go out and play.
I will tell you later.
What do you mean ‘walked’?
And did you find many fish there?”
Are there houses there?
What about families, schools, medical insurance, hospitals, good roads, and so forth?” I have been asked this question.
“What if I lose my job again?
Why did I ever say such-and-such to so-and-so?
No doubt this or that will happen, and I’ll be out on my ear.
Now, I’m really in for it!
How will I pay my bills?” One worry brings up another, which brings up yet another.
Moreover, we cannot control what happens to our bodies.
We cannot control whether our next sensation will be pleasant or unpleasant.
“They need me!
I can’t be sick!
I can’t die!”—attachment.
“This is the same diagnosis my friend had.
His wife still cries when we talk about him.”—sadness.
Because if we don’t know them, we can treat all people alike.
Who will be left to cultivate hatred?
There will be no more struggle, no more fighting.
Have you noticed how you feel when you are angry?
Do you experience tension, pain in your chest, burning in your stomach, blurred eyesight?
Does your reasoning become unclear, or your speech turn harsh and unpleasant?
Doctors tell us that these common manifestations of anger have serious consequences for our health—high blood pressure, nightmares, insomnia, ulcers, even heart disease.
Don’t you generally try to avoid people who are angry?
In the same way, when you are angry, people avoid you.
Since it’s clear that anger can hurt us, what can we do about it?
How can we let go of anger and replace it with loving-friendliness?
“Of course.
I visit them often.”
You die unconfused and…are reborn in the highest realm of existence.
You develop the prayerful wish, “May such pain not happen to anybody in the world.
I wish that no child be abused the way I have been abused.”
How can I help?
If I get angry or upset, I will not be able to help in any way.
We may consider ourselves to be compassionate people, but our level of compassion cannot compare to this!
Suffering surrounds us.
The answer is that pain—even the pain of others—is hard to endure.
Do we respond with blame or forgiveness?
Anxiety or equanimity?
Harshness or gentleness?
Patience or fury?
If we add to our burden by holding an oppressive or judgmental attitude about our practice, we may soon decide—rightly!—that now we’re suffering even more.
We may even feel compelled to quit.
Are you clinging to something?
People often ask me: “How can I integrate my meditation practice and my daily life?” I often respond with questions of my own: “What did you do on the cushion?
Did you merely focus the mind on the breath?” If that is all you did, you have two different lives going on: your life on the cushion and everyday, ordinary life.
Next I think: Okay, it’s true that this man insulted me, but what did I do to upset him?
Was I too hasty or greedy?
Too arrogant?
Maybe I meant no harm, but I know I’ve upset people this way before.
Ask yourself, “Is this item necessary, or am I buying it for some other reason?
Do I just want to impress people?
Don’t I already have some similar things collecting dust in my closet?” You may also ask, “Is there a better use for this money, some way I can use it to help other people?”
If you feel unsure of your motives, perhaps because greed and necessity are mixed together, or because the desire is overwhelming, ask yourself: “Can this purchase wait?
Can I walk away for now and come back next week?
Can I ask the clerk to hold this while I cool off and think about it?” This kind of reasoning makes skillful use of the good habits that we practice in sitting meditation.
Let me keep my mind clear.
” First, I recalled my intellectual understanding of what death is.
I actually enjoyed watching the flames coming out of the engine at thirty-nine thousand feet!
The flames were blue, yellow, and red.
They seemed almost to be dead before they died!
I noticed, however, that the little children did not seem affected.
Have you noticed, for instance, that people tend to speak to us as they have heard us speak?
If we are known to exaggerate or to lie, others find it easier to lie to us.
Just imagine never having to regret anything you say!
That would release many of us from a heavy burden.
Will we speak words that awaken, console, and encourage others?
Or will we cut them down, injuring ourselves in the process?
Slanderous talk, cruel gossip, lies, and crude or profane jokes not only abuse others but make us look like fools who are unable to wield the ax in our mouths without bloodying ourselves.
Someone mentioned the Bhavana Society in this gathering, and a woman exclaimed, “Oh!
That’s the center where they have that tea ceremony in the evenings!” When our board member protested, the lady insisted that she knew her statement to be true.
The test is to stop and ask ourselves before we speak: “Is it true?
Is it kind?
Is it beneficial?
Does it harm anyone?
Is this the right time to say something?”
You can analyze your past actions and ask yourself: “Did I speak correctly yesterday?
Have I spoken only gently, kindly, meaningfully, and truthfully?” If you find that you have erred in some way, you can pledge to improve your mindfulness of Skillful Speech.
Be careful!
Use only gentle, well-selected words.
When you see that you have disciplined your mind and your words and that the situation has become more harmonious, be happy about it!
Say to yourself, “This is what I want.
Finally, I recited a lengthy blessing chant, and when I finished, I said, “Now you can go home.
The meeting is over.”
The test of Skillful Speech is to stop and ask yourself before you speak: “Is it true?
Does it harm anyone ?
To take revenge, he harassed them by secretly doing things to their personal belongings like dunking their washcloths into the toilet and damaging their computers!
Petty meanness and practical jokes that hurt people are also wrong actions.
Another trick we play is saying to ourselves, “What good are these moral principles to me?
My life is fine just the way it is.”
If your life is so fine, why do you lie, steal, drink, or kill?
Breaking moral principles quickly becomes a habit that is hard to break.
But we shouldn’t become militant in our support of nonharming!
Skillful Action asks us to make our own decisions about moral behavior, not to insist adamantly that everyone follow our example.
I doubt anyone has ever attained enlightenment by practicing meditation on a stolen meditation cushion!
Our library has a similar problem.
They took the bag home and discovered that it contained more than thirty-six thousand dollars!
With their parents’ support, the boys decided to turn the money over to the police.
What is the point of this kind of fun?
To give you pleasure?
To fulfill your desires?
Yet, we’ve been saying all along that craving—desire—is the very root of our misery.
Now what does the leper think of the fire?
No power on earth can make him want to burn himself again.
Aside from sexual misconduct, what does this mean?
When one indulges one’s cravings by stimulating any senses to the point of weariness, it is sense abuse.
What would it be like to abandon them?
Self-respect can grow in their place.
In what other ways do we drug ourselves, and why?
Using this aspect of Skillful Action as a general guideline, question your motivations, ask whether you are trying to avoid being mindful.
What are your escapes?
Reading the newspaper?
Engaging in unnecessary chatter?
Mindfulness can help you identify the tricks you use to avoid continuous awareness of reality.
When we get home, we sometimes feel that we need a vacation to recuperate from our vacation!
Then it’s back to work, for there is no vacation without money, and no money without very hard work.
How difficult it is for us to make a commitment!
The vow ceremony itself was very simple.
But why should they thank me?
I did not ask them to take these precepts.
I even go so far as to say that mindfulness of observing the precepts—whether the five, eight, or lifetime precepts—makes you look more beautiful!
When you speak or act while keeping the precepts in mind, you feel peaceful and happy.
They will hate each other for generations!
Quarreling between neighbors goes on everywhere.
The monk spoke to him gently, not like the victim of a theft, but more like a concerned grandparent, asking earnestly, “Have you gotten enough fruit?
Do you need more?” There was no need to raise a great hue and cry and risk the man being hurt in a struggle with the temple’s supporters.
That is, does it cause harm by definition?
Does it involve manufacturing, buying, selling, promoting, or using guns or other weapons?
Does it involve intoxicants or poisons?
Does it entail harming or killing living beings?
The Buddha himself mentioned that jobs involving weapons, poisons, or killing are definitely wrong livelihood.
For instance, is working for the military always inherently wrong?
It depends.
Building nuclear warheads clearly fits the Buddha’s list of forbidden occupations, but what aboutmining the uranium used in nuclear weapons?
Is it inherently wrong to work for a general merchandise chain store that makes substantial profits from selling guns?
What about working for the minimum wage flipping burgers at a fast-food outlet?
You can imagine many ways in which a job might indirectly cause harm to others.
In such cases, you should ask yourself, “Am I directly involved in dealing with poisons, weapons, or killing?
Am I intentionally causing harm to others or to myself?” As a general rule, the more distance there is between your on-the-job activities and the harm that might befall others as a result, the less likely it is that the job fits the category of inherently wrong occupations.
Dishonest coworkers?
Rude clients?
Chemical solvents that might injure the lungs?
Products with a harmful impact on the environment?
Indirect connections with companies employing sweatshop workers?
The Buddha’s teachings on loving-friendliness tell us that we must care not only about ourselves and our immediate family but about our extended family, our neighbors, our community—everyone!
Each of us is only a small individual cell, but joined with trillions of others we are the body of the world.
At every stage the employee must ask, “What actions can I take with equanimity, loving-friendliness, compassion, and concern for all beings?
What actions support my wholesomeness of mind?”
It is said that nothing can harm a person who is pouring out loving-friendliness—not even bullets or fire, much less harassment at the office!
If you cultivate strong loving-friendliness as you begin each workday, who knows how many things may change?
Even habitual wrongdoers sometimes reform their behavior when someone, somewhere, sends them strong, pure loving-friendliness each day.
My friends and my family said to me, “You are in a prestigious position, at the first Theravada temple in the United States, right here in the nation’s capital.
You should not give all that up.”
What if there is only one source of jobs in the area?
What if you have many children, ailing parents, or a chronically sick child to support, and the only job you can get to easily is working at a nearby liquor store?
What if you live in an area where hunting and fishing are necessary to get by?
What is Skillful Livelihood for people who live in extreme economic deprivation or who are coerced by those in power to engage in illegal activities, such as growing plants to produce illegal drugs?
If you are in such a situation, comfort yourself with the knowledge that so long as you have no intention to harm, you are not responsible for harmful consequences that you do not personally and directly cause.
Later, when he had returned to his monastery, the Buddha’s monks became curious and asked the Buddha a question.
One set of doubt-inspiring topics involves questions about the past and future: “Did I exist before birth?
What kinds of past lives did I have, and what were they like?
Is there life after death?
Will I be annihilated?
Is there a heaven or a hell?
Will I be reborn?
What kinds of lives will I have?”
The present can also fill us with doubt: “Do I exist?
Do I not exist?
Am I okay?
How did I arrive at my present state?”
Why are they called fetters?
Because like strong iron chains they keep us bound to suffering in this lifetime and to future repeated deaths and rebirths.
Once these are overcome, there is a moment of peace, but then the mind falls asleep!
Dullness and drowsiness come out of the fetter of ignorance.
You sit there thinking, “Do people really become enlightened?
Is this practice really going to help?
Am I doing it right?
Those other people seem to be doing it better.
By maintaining unremitting mindfulness.
She scolded her, “You foolish woman!
You slept until the sun came up.
Get up this very minute and go back to work.” The servant woman got up.
The servant woman ran out of the house with her bloody head and cried very loudly, “Look, friends!
My mistress beat me up for getting up a little late today.
The most difficult kind of negative thought to overcome is one that you do not notice until it is deeply entrenched.
Such thoughts block the mind and prevent it from developing.
In such cases, you need to use stronger effort.
This may be the time to develop insight by examining the problematic thought.
What can you do?
You can try diverting your mind to something else.
As the Buddha said: “Let my blood dry up!
Let the flesh of my body wither away!
Let my body be reduced to a skeleton!
I will not get up from this meditation seat without attaining enlightenment.”
Then the horse trainer said, “You are supposed to be teaching nonviolence!
How can you kill?”
He “killed” an offending person by boycotting or ignoring the person totally, who was then cut off from the community of monks.
You abandon them through five applications of effort, known as suppressing, substituting, destroying, subsiding, and escaping.
When you think of this incident now, how do you feel?
Again you feel light, free, relaxed, and happy.
How often have you made wonderful promises to yourself?
Remember the New Year’s resolutions or the wedding vows you made in front of the priest or friends?
Remember how many times you made hopeful wishes on your birthday?
How many of them did you keep?
You may have promised yourself: “I will never touch another cigarette, never take another drink, never lie, never speak harshly or insult anyone.
Oh, how calm and peaceful I have been during this retreat!
This is what I will do in the future.”
But how many of them do you continuously put into action every day?
These thoughts arise in your mind like the bubbles in a glass of soda water.
We marvel at the skills of Olympic athletes—did they perfect these abilities in a day?
How many times did you fall from your bicycle when you first tried to ride?
Perfecting good thoughts is just like that.
The great master decided to discipline the junior monk by asking him to go to a certain house to collect alms food.
He wanted the junior monk to make a good connection with that household, for they had a newborn child that the monks expected to become a great Buddhist leader.
He galloped to the house, leapt from his horse, ran into the house, and shouted at the top of his lungs, “What did you give to that wretched bald-headed man?
Who is it that gave him anything?”
It’s owww!
Even without the awareness of “I” in that moment, suffering nonetheless exists.
Do you enjoy suffering?
Is that the purpose of living?
Whether there is self or not, this is what you don’t want: suffering!
Therefore of course it matters, very much, whether you suffer.”
If you just end up with more unwholesome states that bring suffering, what is the point of all the work you have been doing to follow the Buddha’s path?
You must reflect repeatedly on your actions and on the results your actions bring.
I know the place where no one will ever look.
Now let us find it!
Mindfulness is not aimed at learning something external.
How does mindfulness bring wisdom, and how does wisdom cause us to let go of the obstructions?
As we search within ourselves, seeking to understand the truth of happiness, we become aware of and observe the five aggregates of body and mind.
We start with any one object of meditation: the breath, a feeling, a mind state, one of the hindrances or fetters—it doesn’t matter.
Whatever we focus on will soon change.
You may wonder, “What if my mind doesn’t stay with the original object?
Any meditation that helps you to see the truth is a good meditation.
You might wonder, “What is there to be mindful of?
When I walk, I walk.
They just walk!
Everything happens in a split second.
How can walking lead to this insight?
While you walk, you are mindfully observing your posture and the movement of your body.
Not that you want to discard the body before you die!
You do want to maintain the body, wash it, clothe it, protect it.
What else can you do?
Can you run away from this truth?
You may wonder, for example, “Where have I gone wrong?
Why have I not gained the expected results attained by others?
Maybe I am missing something; let me try again from the beginning.”
For example, if you do not know better, when neutral feeling arises, you may think, “Ah!
This is the soul; this is how the soul feels in its neutral state, when it is not affected by other things.
Uniting the mind with the breath puts the mind into the present moment.
The breath also functions as a home base to which the mind can return after investigating other phenomena.
How long would it take to burn the spider web?
You can hardly bring the candle close to the web before it burns.
“Oh, what happiness!
Happiness is like that.
How does this come about?
As wholesome concentration deepens, the mind gradually loses interest in other things and stays with the object of meditation, such as the breath.
The Buddha urged his monks to “practice, develop, and fix” the sign.
What is it that we want to burn?
So, once you establish skilled concentration, what object do you focus on?
You focus the wholesome one-pointed mind on the constant change of the components of your body and mind: physical form, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and consciousness.
What understanding did the Buddha reach?
As you have learned, the five hindrances—greed, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt—get in the way of full concentration.
It is called sleep!
Some of them even snore.
Don’t fool yourself!
This is pure delusion.
Don’t feel discouraged!
It can take many years to reach full concentration.
There are the mighty Yudhāmanyu, the very powerful Uttamaujā, the son of Subhadrā and the sons of Draupadī.
All these warriors are great chariot fighters.
There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake.
All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.
King Yudhiṣṭhira, the son of Kuntī, blew his conchshell, the Ananta-vijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughoṣa and Maṇipuṣpaka.
That great archer the King of Kāśī, the great fighter Śikhaṇḍī, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, the unconquerable Sātyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadī, and others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadrā, all blew their respective conchshells.
The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious.
Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
At that time Arjuna, the son of Pāṇḍu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanumān, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows.
O King, after looking at the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord Kṛṣṇa these words.
I am now unable to stand here any longer.
I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling.
I see only causes of misfortune, O Kṛṣṇa, killer of the Keśī demon.
O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield?
O Madhusūdana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me?
O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
What pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra?
Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors.
Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and our friends.
What should we gain, O Kṛṣṇa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?
An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition.
The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped.
Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts.
Driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you?
They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life.
They lead not to higher planets but to infamy.
O son of Pṛthā, do not yield to this degrading impotence.
It does not become you.
Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.
It would be better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers.
Even though desiring worldly gain, they are superiors.
If they are killed, everything we enjoy will be tainted with blood.
Nor do we know which is better – conquering them or being conquered by them.
If we killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, we should not care to live.
Yet they are now standing before us on the battlefield.
Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness.
In this condition I am asking You to tell me for certain what is best for me.
Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You.
Please instruct me.
I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses.
I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.
Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.
As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.
A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.
O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.
They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.
Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is no endurance and of the eternal there is no change.
This they have concluded by studying the nature of both.
That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible.
No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul.
For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time.
He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being.
He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval.
He is not slain when the body is slain.
This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried.
He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.
It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable and immutable.
Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.
One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to take birth again.
Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.
All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when annihilated.
So what need is there for lamentation?
O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain.
Therefore you need not grieve for any living being.
Your enemies will describe you in many unkind words and scorn your ability.
What could be more painful for you?
O son of Kuntī, either you will be killed on the battlefield and attain the heavenly planets, or you will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom.
Therefore, get up with determination and fight.
Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.
O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.
Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth.
Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.
The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature.
O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes.
Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.
All purposes served by a small well can at once be served by a great reservoir of water.
Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.
Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.
Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure.
Such equanimity is called yoga.
O Dhanañjaya, keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional service, and in that consciousness surrender unto the Lord.
Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers.
A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad reactions even in this life.
Therefore strive for yoga, which is the art of all work.
By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world.
In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries .
Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence?
How does he speak, and what is his language?
How does he sit, and how does he walk?
Though the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, the taste for sense objects remains.
But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.
From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory.
When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool.
One who is not connected with the Supreme can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace.
And how can there be any happiness without peace?
That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered.
If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.
My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions.
Therefore, please tell me decisively which will be most beneficial for me.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self.
Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service.
Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working.
One cannot even maintain one’s physical body without work.
Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed; otherwise work causes bondage in this material world.
Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.
In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajña , will supply all necessities to you.
But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief.
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice.
Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.
Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.
My dear Arjuna, one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice thus established by the Vedas certainly leads a life full of sin.
Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain.
A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work.
Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being.
Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties.
Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work.
Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow.
And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.
O son of Pṛthā, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems.
Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I a need to obtain anything – and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties.
If I did not perform prescribed duties, all these worlds would be put to ruination.
I would be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all living beings.
So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of prescribed duties, a learned person should not induce them to stop work.
Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage them in all sorts of activities .
Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached.
But the wise should not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers’ lack of knowledge.
Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes.
What can repression accomplish?
There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects.
One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.
It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another’s duties perfectly.
Destruction in the course of performing one’s own duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path is dangerous.
The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust.
Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.
This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.
But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.
Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvān is senior by birth to You.
How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?
The Personality of Godhead said: Many, many births both you and I have passed.
I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!
As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.
Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.
According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me.
And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.
There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action.
One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.
All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature.
Therefore you should perform your duty, following in their footsteps.
The intricacies of action are very hard to understand.
Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is and what inaction is.
One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of desire for sense gratification.
He is said by sages to be a worker for whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.
Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts only for the bare necessities of life.
Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions.
Still others, who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing.
Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice.
All these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of them are born of different types of work.
Knowing them as such, you will become liberated.
O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than the mere sacrifice of material possessions.
After all, O son of Pṛthā, all sacrifices of work culminate in transcendental knowledge.
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.
Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.
But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not attain God consciousness; they fall down.
For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in this world nor in the next.
Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be slashed by the weapon of knowledge.
Armed with yoga, O Bhārata, stand and fight.
Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion.
Now will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?
The Personality of Godhead replied: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation.
But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of work.
One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced.
Such a person, free from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.
Only the ignorant speak of devotional service as being different from the analytical study of the material world .
Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both.
Merely renouncing all activities yet not engaging in the devotional service of the Lord cannot make one happy.
But a thoughtful person engaged in devotional service can achieve the Supreme without delay.
One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him.
Though always working, such a man is never entangled.
A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping and breathing, always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all.
Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, or opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them.
The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action.
All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.
Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone’s sinful or pious activities.
Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.
Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death.
They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.
Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within.
In this way the self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the Supreme.
O son of Kuntī, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.
One whose happiness is within, who is active and rejoices within, and whose aim is inward is actually the perfect mystic.
He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within the nostrils, and thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the transcendentalist aiming at liberation becomes free from desire, fear and anger.
One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.
One must deliver himself with the help of his mind, and not degrade himself.
The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.
For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity.
To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.
A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogī when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization.
Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled.
He sees everything – whether it be pebbles, stones or gold – as the same.
One should hold one’s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose.
Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.
In the stage of perfection called trance, or samādhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga.
This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self.
In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses.
Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty.
This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.
One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with determination and faith and not be deviated from the path.
One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of mental speculation and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.
The yogī whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness.
He is beyond the mode of passion, he realizes his qualitative identity with the Supreme, and thus he is freed from all reactions to past deeds.
A true yogī observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me.
Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work.
But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of success.
That is My opinion.
This is my doubt, O Kṛṣṇa, and I ask You to dispel it completely.
But for You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.
Or he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom.
Certainly, such a birth is rare in this world.
By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles – even without seeking them.
Such an inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures.
A yogī is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker.
Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogī.
And of all yogīs, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself and renders transcendental loving service to Me – he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.
I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal and numinous.
This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know.
All created beings have their source in these two natures.
Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution.
O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me.
Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.
I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire.
I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.
I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire.
I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O lord of the Bhāratas .
Know that all states of being – be they of goodness, passion or ignorance – are manifested by My energy.
I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent.
I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.
Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best.
For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.
All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self.
Being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal.
After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.
Such a great soul is very rare.
I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul.
But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.
Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.
Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.
Unintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality.
Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is imperishable and supreme.
I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.
For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.
O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come.
I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.
Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service.
They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities.
Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman?
What is the self?
What are fruitive activities?
What is this material manifestation?
And what are the demigods?
Please explain this to me.
Who is the Lord of sacrifice, and how does He live in the body, O Madhusūdana?
And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called adhyātma, the self.
Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma, or fruitive activities.
O best of the embodied beings, the physical nature, which is constantly changing, is called adhibhūta .
The universal form of the Lord, which includes all the demigods, like those of the sun and moon, is called adhidaiva.
And I, the Supreme Lord, represented as the Supersoul in the heart of every embodied being, am called adhiyajña .
And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature.
Of this there is no doubt.
Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kṛṣṇa and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting.
With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.
One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person.
He is luminous like the sun, and He is transcendental, beyond this material nature.
Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁ-kāra, and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman.
Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy.
I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation.
The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements.
Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.
From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.
But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kuntī, never takes birth again.
By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together form the duration of Brahmā’s one day.
And such also is the duration of his night.
Yet there is another unmanifest nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter.
It is supreme and is never annihilated.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by unalloyed devotion.
Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.
According to Vedic opinion, there are two ways of passing from this world – one in light and one in darkness.
When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.
Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never bewildered.
Therefore be always fixed in devotion.
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities.
Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.
This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets.
It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion.
It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.
Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies.
Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.
By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.
All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
The whole cosmic order is under Me.
Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end.
O Dhanañjaya, all this work cannot bind Me.
I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral.
This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, producing all moving and nonmoving beings.
Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.
Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.
They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.
Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views.
In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.
O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature.
They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.
But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant.
I am the butter and the fire and the offering.
I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support and the grandsire.
I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable oṁ.
I am also the Ṛg, the Sāma and the Yajur Vedas.
I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend.
I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.
O Arjuna, I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain.
I am immortality, and I am also death personified.
Both spirit and matter are in Me.
Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly.
Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.
When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again.
Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death.
I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices.
Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down.
In this way you will be freed from bondage to work and its auspicious and inauspicious results.
With your mind fixed on Me in this principle of renunciation, you will be liberated and come to Me.
I am equal to all.
But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.
He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace.
O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.
How much more this is so of the righteous brāhmaṇas, the devotees and the saintly kings.
Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me.
Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me.
Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Listen again, O mighty-armed Arjuna.
Because you are My dear friend, for your benefit I shall speak to you further, giving knowledge that is better than what I have already explained.
I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.
Everything emanates from Me.
The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.
Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth.
You are the eternal, transcendental, original person, the unborn, the greatest.
All the great sages such as Nārada, Asita, Devala and Vyāsa confirm this truth about You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.
O Kṛṣṇa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me.
Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality.
O Kṛṣṇa, O supreme mystic, how shall I constantly think of You, and how shall I know You?
In what various forms are You to be remembered, O Supreme Personality of Godhead?
O Janārdana, again please describe in detail the mystic power of Your opulences.
I am never satiated in hearing about You, for the more I hear the more I want to taste the nectar of Your words.
I am the Supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities.
I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.
Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Bṛhaspati.
Of generals I am Kārttikeya, and of bodies of water I am the ocean.
Of the great sages I am Bhṛgu; of vibrations I am the transcendental oṁ.
Of sacrifices I am the chanting of the holy names , and of immovable things I am the Himālayas.
Of all trees I am the banyan tree, and of the sages among the demigods I am Nārada.
Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the sage Kapila.
Of horses know Me to be Uccaiḥśravā, produced during the churning of the ocean for nectar.
Of lordly elephants I am Airāvata, and among men I am the monarch.
Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi.
Of causes for procreation I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am Vāsuki.
Of the many-hooded Nāgas I am Ananta, and among the aquatics I am the demigod Varuṇa.
Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna.
Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.
Of letters I am the letter A, and among compound words I am the dual compound.
I am also inexhaustible time, and of creators I am Brahmā.
I am all-devouring death, and I am the generating principle of all that is yet to be.
Among women I am fame, fortune, fine speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and patience.
Of the hymns in the Sāma Veda I am the Bṛhat-sāma, and of poetry I am the Gāyatrī.
Of months I am Mārgaśīrṣa , and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.
I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor.
I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong.
Of the descendants of Vṛṣṇi I am Vāsudeva, and of the Pāṇḍavas I am Arjuna.
Of the sages I am Vyāsa, and among great thinkers I am Uśanā.
Among all means of suppressing lawlessness I am punishment, and of those who seek victory I am morality.
Of secret things I am silence, and of the wise I am the wisdom.
Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences.
There is no being – moving or nonmoving – that can exist without Me.
O mighty conqueror of enemies, there is no end to My divine manifestations.
What I have spoken to you is but a mere indication of My infinite opulences.
But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge?
With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.
O best of the Bhāratas, see here the different manifestations of Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, Aśvinī-kumāras and all the other demigods.
Behold the many wonderful things which no one has ever seen or heard of before.
O Arjuna, whatever you wish to see, behold at once in this body of Mine!
This universal form can show you whatever you now desire to see and whatever you may want to see in the future.
Everything – moving and nonmoving – is here completely, in one place.
Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions.
The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many divine upraised weapons.
He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over His body.
All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all-expanding.
Arjuna said: My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, I see assembled in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities.
I see Brahmā sitting on the lotus flower, as well as Lord Śiva and all the sages and divine serpents.
O Lord of the universe, O universal form, I see in Your body many, many arms, bellies, mouths and eyes, expanded everywhere, without limit.
I see in You no end, no middle and no beginning.
Your form is difficult to see because of its glaring effulgence, spreading on all sides, like blazing fire or the immeasurable radiance of the sun.
Yet I see this glowing form everywhere, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs.
You are without origin, middle or end.
Your glory is unlimited.
You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are Your eyes.
I see You with blazing fire coming forth from Your mouth, burning this entire universe by Your own radiance.
Although You are one, You spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between.
O great one, seeing this wondrous and terrible form, all the planetary systems are perturbed.
All the hosts of demigods are surrendering before You and entering into You.
Some of them, very much afraid, are offering prayers with folded hands.
Hosts of great sages and perfected beings, crying “All peace!” are praying to You by singing the Vedic hymns.
O Viṣṇu, I see You devouring all people from all sides with Your flaming mouths.
Covering all the universe with Your effulgence, You are manifest with terrible, scorching rays.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.
With the exception of you , all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain.
Therefore get up.
Prepare to fight and win glory.
Conquer your enemies and enjoy a flourishing kingdom.
They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasācī, can be but an instrument in the fight.
Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Jayadratha, Karṇa and the other great warriors have already been destroyed by Me.
Therefore, kill them and do not be disturbed.
Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies in battle.
Sañjaya said to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the trembling Arjuna offered obeisances with folded hands again and again.
He fearfully spoke to Lord Kṛṣṇa in a faltering voice, as follows.
Arjuna said: O master of the senses, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name, and thus everyone becomes attached to You.
Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there.
All this is rightly done.
O great one, greater even than Brahmā, You are the original creator.
Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You?
O limitless one, God of gods, refuge of the universe!
You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.
You are the original Personality of Godhead, the oldest, the ultimate sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world.
You are the knower of everything, and You are all that is knowable.
You are the supreme refuge, above the material modes.
O limitless form!
This whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!
You are air, and You are the supreme controller!
You are fire, You are water, and You are the moon!
You are Brahmā, the first living creature, and You are the great-grandfather.
I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand times, and again and yet again!
Obeisances to You from the front, from behind and from all sides!
O unbounded power, You are the master of limitless might!
You are all-pervading, and thus You are everything!
Thinking of You as my friend, I have rashly addressed You “O Kṛṣṇa,” “O Yādava,” “O my friend,” not knowing Your glories.
Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love.
I have dishonored You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends.
O infallible one, please excuse me for all those offenses.
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving.
You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master.
No one is greater than You, nor can anyone be one with You.
How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?
You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being.
Thus I fall down to offer You my respectful obeisances and ask Your mercy.
As a father tolerates the impudence of his son, a friend the impertinence of a friend, or a husband the familiarity of his wife, please tolerate the wrongs I may have done You.
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear.
Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.
O universal form, O thousand-armed Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands.
I long to see You in that form.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, happily have I shown you, by My internal potency, this supreme universal form within the material world.
No one before you has ever seen this primal form, unlimited and full of glaring effulgence.
You have been perturbed and bewildered by seeing this horrible feature of Mine.
Now let it be finished.
My devotee, be free again from all disturbances.
With a peaceful mind you can now see the form you desire.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, this form of Mine you are now seeing is very difficult to behold.
Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.
The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship.
It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly.
Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.
For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.
To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.
Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me.
Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.
My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga.
In this way develop a desire to attain Me.
If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge.
Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind.
Arjuna said: O my dear Kṛṣṇa, I wish to know about prakṛti , puruṣa , and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kuntī, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.
O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge.
I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal.
Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.
Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere.
In this way the Supersoul exists, pervading everything.
The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses.
He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings.
He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all the modes of material nature.
The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving.
Because He is subtle, He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know.
Although far, far away, He is also near to all.
He is the source of light in all luminous objects.
He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested.
He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge.
He is situated in everyone’s heart.
Thus the field of activities , knowledge and the knowable have been summarily described by Me.
Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature.
Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless.
Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.
The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.
This is due to his association with that material nature.
Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.
One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.
He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.
Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others.
Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth and death.
Those with the vision of eternity can see that the imperishable soul is transcendental, eternal, and beyond the modes of nature.
Despite contact with the material body, O Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled.
Material nature consists of three modes – goodness, passion and ignorance.
When the eternal living entity comes in contact with nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he becomes conditioned by these modes.
O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions.
Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge.
O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, is the delusion of all embodied living entities.
The results of this mode are madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.
The result of pious action is pure and is said to be in the mode of goodness.
But action done in the mode of passion results in misery, and action performed in the mode of ignorance results in foolishness.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns.
One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.
The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature.
The twigs are the objects of the senses.
This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world.
No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is.
But with determination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of detachment.
Thereafter, one must seek that place from which, having gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since time immemorial.
That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity.
Those who reach it never return to this material world.
Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.
The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas.
Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another.
The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind.
The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature.
But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.
The endeavoring transcendentalists who are situated in self-realization can see all this clearly.
But those whose minds are not developed and who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try.
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me.
And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.
I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit.
I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.
I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.
By all the Vedas, I am to be known.
Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.
There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible.
In the material world every living entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every living entity is called infallible.
Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything.
He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.
Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.
The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demoniac qualities make for bondage.
Do not worry, O son of Pāṇḍu, for you are born with the divine qualities.
Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done.
Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.
They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control.
They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.
They believe that to gratify the senses is the prime necessity of human civilization.
Thus until the end of life their anxiety is immeasurable.
Bound by a network of hundreds of thousands of desires and absorbed in lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.
There are three gates leading to this hell – lust, anger and greed.
Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.
One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures.
Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.
Arjuna inquired: O Kṛṣṇa, what is the situation of those who do not follow the principles of scripture but worship according to their own imagination?
Are they in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: According to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one’s faith can be of three kinds – in goodness, in passion or in ignorance.
Now hear about this.
Even the food each person prefers is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature.
The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity.
Now hear of the distinctions between them.
Foods dear to those in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one’s existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction.
Such foods are juicy, fatty, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart.
Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry and burning are dear to those in the mode of passion.
Such foods cause distress, misery and disease.
Penance performed out of pride and for the sake of gaining respect, honor and worship is said to be in the mode of passion.
It is neither stable nor permanent.
From the beginning of creation, the three words oṁ tat sat were used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth.
These three symbolic representations were used by brāhmaṇas while chanting the hymns of the Vedas and during sacrifices for the satisfaction of the Supreme.
Without desiring fruitive results, one should perform various kinds of sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat.
The purpose of such transcendental activities is to get free from material entanglement.
The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat.
The performer of such sacrifice is also called sat, as are all works of sacrifice, penance and charity which, true to the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of Pṛthā.
Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of Pṛthā, is impermanent.
It is called asat and is useless both in this life and the next.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The giving up of activities that are based on material desire is what great learned men call the renounced order of life .
And giving up the results of all activities is what the wise call renunciation .
O best of the Bhāratas, now hear My judgment about renunciation.
O tiger among men, renunciation is declared in the scriptures to be of three kinds.
Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up; they must be performed.
Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.
All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result.
They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Pṛthā.
That is My final opinion.
Prescribed duties should never be renounced.
If one gives up his prescribed duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion.
Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.
It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities.
But he who renounces the fruits of action is called one who has truly renounced.
For one who is not renounced, the threefold fruits of action – desirable, undesirable and mixed – accrue after death.
But those who are in the renounced order of life have no such result to suffer or enjoy.
According to the three different modes of material nature, there are three kinds of knowledge, action and performer of action.
Now hear of them from Me.
By following his qualities of work, every man can become perfect.
Now please hear from Me how this can be done.
It is better to engage in one’s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly.
Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.
Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke.
Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kuntī, even if such work is full of fault.
One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments or desires to have anything.
He is equally disposed toward every living entity.
In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.
One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service.
And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.
In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection.
In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.
If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace.
If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.
If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be falsely directed.
By your nature, you will have to be engaged in warfare.
Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction.
But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kuntī.
O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly.
By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.
Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential.
Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do.
Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you My supreme instruction, the most confidential knowledge of all.
Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.
Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.
Thus you will come to Me without fail.
I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.
I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions.
Do not fear.
O son of Pṛthā, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind?
And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?
Arjuna said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone.
I have regained my memory by Your mercy.
I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions.
Sañjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.
And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.
Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.
ARE you afraid of death?
Do you wonder what is going to happen to you after you die?
Is it possible you have a spirit which came from somewhere else and will return there after your body dies, or is this just wishful thinking because you are afraid?
If we do actually have a soul, then where does it go after death?
Is there really some sort of heaven full of intelligent spirits outside our physical universe?
What does it look like?
What do we do when we get there?
Is there a supreme being in charge of this paradise?
These questions are as old as humankind itself and still remain a mystery to most of us.
How valid is the use of hypnosis for uncovering truth?
People in hypnosis are neither dreaming nor hallucinating.
Oh, my god!
I’m not really dead—am I?
I mean, my body is dead—I can see it below me—but I’m floating … I can look down and see my body lying flat in the hospital bed.
I’m supposed to be dead, but I’m still alive!
It’s strange, because my body is absolutely dead while I’m moving around it from above.
It’s like watching a movie, only I’m in it!
The doctor is comforting my wife and daughter.
What are the similarities of afterlife recollection between people reporting on their out-of-body experiences as a result of a temporary physical trauma and a subject in hypnosis recalling death in a past life?
Both find themselves floating around their bodies in a strange way, trying to touch solid objects which dematerialize in front of them.
The scene in Case 2 opens on the American southern plains right after an arrow has struck Sally in the neck at close range.
I am always careful with death scenes involving violent trauma in past lives because the subconscious mind often still retains these experiences.
The subject in this case came to me because of a lifetime of throat discomfort.
Release therapy and deprogramming is usually required in these cases.
Yes … the point has torn my throat … I’m dying .
I’m choking … blood pouring down … Will is holding me … the pain … terrible … I’m getting out now … it’s over, anyway.
Souls often leave their human hosts moments before actual death when their bodies are in great pain.
Who can blame them?
Nevertheless, they do stay close by the dying body.
After calming techniques, I raise this subject from the subconscious to the superconscious level for the transition to spiritual memories.
All right, Sally, you have accepted being killed by these Indians.
Will you please describe to me the exact sensation you feel at the time of death?
Out where?
Describe what “me” means.
What does the thing that is you look like going out of the head of your body?
From … my energy.
I look sort of transparent white … my soul …
Well, it’s as if I shed my skin … peeling a banana.
I just lose my body in one swoosh!
It’s wonderful to feel so free with no more pain, but … I am … disoriented … I didn’t expect to die …
I understand, Sally.
You are feeling a little displacement at the moment as a soul.
This is normal in your situation for what you have just gone through.
Listen and respond to my questions.
You said you were floating.
Are you able to move around freely right after death?
When I was free of my body the pulling lessened.
Now, I feel a nudge … drawing me away from my body … I don’t want to go yet … but, something wants me to go soon …
I understand, Sally, but I suspect you are learning you have some element of control.
How would you describe this thing that is pulling you?
I reinforce the imagery of a protective shield around this subject, which is so important as a foundation to calming procedures.
Sally’s soul is still hovering over her body after I move the scene forward in time to when the Indians are driven off by the wagon train rifles.
I’m over Will’s head.
I’m trying to console him.
I want him to feel my love is not really gone … I want him to know he has not lost me forever and that I will see him again.
There is so much grief, but he … feels my essence … I know it.
Our friends are around him … and they separate us finally … they want to reform the wagons and get started again.
All right, Sally, now we are going to move forward in relative time again.
Do you see your wagon train friends placing your body in some kind of grave?
Yes, they have buried me.
It’s time for me to go … they are coming for me now … I’m moving … into a brighter light …
How should we best prepare for our own death?
Our lives may be short or long, healthy or sick, but there comes that time when we all must meet death in a way suited for us.
You are now leaving your body.
See yourself moving further and further away from the place where you died, away from the plane of Earth.
Report back to me what you are experiencing.
I feel a tugging … a gentle pulling … I think I’m supposed to drift through this tunnel … and I do.
It is more gray than dark now, because the bright circle is expanding in front of me.
It’s as if …
The circle of light grows very wide and … I’m out of the tunnel.
There is a … cloudy brightness … a light fog.
I’m filtering through it.
I feel the … power of thought all around me.
Just relax completely and let your impressions come through easily as you continue to report back to me exactly what is happening to you.
Please go on.
Well, it’s hard to put into words.
I feel … thoughts of love … companionship … empathy … and it’s all combined with … anticipation … as if others are … waiting for me.
I’m not scared.
When I was in the tunnel, I was more … disoriented.
Yes, I feel secure … I’m aware of thoughts reaching out to me … of caring … nurturing.
It is strange, but there is also the understanding around me of just who I am and why I am here now.
You mentioned cloud-like substances around you right after leaving the tunnel.
Are you in a sky over Earth?
Can you see the Earth at all?
Is it below you?
That’s a possibility—yes.
In my mind Earth seems close … and I still feel connected to Earth … but I know I’m in another space.
It’s not like that when I get through the tunnel.
I see layers … levels of light … they appear to me to be … translucent … indented …
That’s what I’m trying to explain.
It’s not solid, although you might think so at first.
It’s layered—the levels of light are all woven together in … stratified threads.
I don’t want to make it sound like things are not symmetrical—they are.
But I see variations in thickness and color refraction in the layers.
They also shift back and forth.
I always notice this as I travel away from Earth.
I don’t know.
I didn’t design it.
I didn’t say the layers had any major color tones.
They are all variations of white.
It is lighter … brighter where I’m going, than where I have been.
Around me now is a hazy whiteness which was much brighter than the tunnel.
I am moving across.
For me it is … mostly sweeping, non-material energy which is broken into layers by light and dark color variations.
I think something is … pulling me into my proper level of travel and trying to relax me, too …
Other people have defined these sounds as vibrational in nature, similar to riding on the resonance from the twang of a tuning fork.
Do you agree or disagree with this description?
Oh … I’m out of it … my God, this place is big!
It’s so bright and clean—it even smells good.
I am looking at a beautiful ice palace.
I see my guide coming towards me—she knows what I need.
I tell her, “Why did you allow this to happen?
How could you do this to me?
You made me go through such pain and hardship with Maggie and now you cut off our life together.”
She is trying to soothe me.
Telling me I did a good job and that I will see my life ran its intended course.
Uncle Charlie!
Uncle Charlie, I’m over here!
Because, of all my relatives, I loved him more than anybody.
He died when I was a child and I never got over it.
How do you know it’s Uncle Charlie?
Does he have features you recognize?
Well, yes and no.
I’m floating around and so is he.
It’s … in my mind … he is showing all of himself to me … and what I am most aware of … is his hand stretched out to me.
Yes … as I knew him in my last life … so I won’t be afraid.
He knows I am still a little shocked over my death.
All right, let’s go forward a bit more.
What is Uncle Charlie doing now?
On the count of three, let’s go there.
One—two—three!
Tell me what is happening.
Continue to move towards them.
Do you get the impression they might be waiting for you?
In fact, I realize I have been with them before … No, don’t go!
Uncle Charlie is leaving me.
Why is he going away?
Look deeply with your inner mind.
You must realize why Uncle Charlie is leaving you at this point?
I think I understand.
Uncle Charlie’s job was to be the first person to meet you after your death and see you were okay.
I’d like to know if you feel better now, and more at home.
Yes, I do.
That’s why Uncle Charlie has left me with the others.
A curious phenomenon about the spirit world is that important people in our lives are always able to greet us, even though they may already be living another life in a new body.
It’s so ... warm and comforting.
I’m relieved to be away from Earth.
I just want to stay here always.
There is no tension, or worries, only a sense of well-being.
I’m just floating ... how beautiful ...
All right, keep moving along.
What do you see next?
Now I’m seeing half-formed human shapes—from the waist up only.
Their outlines are transparent, too … I can see through them.
Oh … look!
No, the ones in back are … hazy … far off … but, I have the sensation of their presence.
Larry is in front … coming up to me … Larry!
Oh—they are all here—I only sensed them before.
Now more are coming closer to me.
She is coming over to me … I’ve missed her so much … oh, Mom …
He is here.
I see him floating off to the side.
We all show what we want of ourselves.
He always relates to me with a masculine nature.
It’s right and very natural.
You have just started to actually leave the Earth’s astral plane now, and are moving further and further into the spirit world.
I want you to tell me what you feel.
Yes, it’s my friend Rachel.
She is always here for me when I die.
She doesn’t always stay here.
No, she is with me a lot—in my mind—when I need her.
She is my own guardian .
Why do you call this entity a “she”?
Aren’t spirits supposed to be sexless?
That’s right—in a literal way, because we are capable of both attributes.
Rachel wants to show herself to me as a woman for the visual knowing and it is a mental thing as well with her.
As souls there are periods in our existence when we are more inclined toward one gender than another.
Sort of … but different.
You see the mind behind what we take to be eyes, because that is what we relate to on Earth.
Of course, we can do the same thing as humans on Earth, too …
When you look into a certain person’s eyes on the ground—even people you have just met—and see a light you have known before … well, that tells you something about them.
As a human you don’t know why—but your soul remembers.
As for myself, I have knowingly experienced this instant recognition only once in my life at the moment I first saw my own wife.
The effect is startling, and a bit eerie as well.
Let’s go back to Rachel in the spirit world.
If your guardian did not project an image of herself in human form to you, would you have known her anyway?
Well, naturally we can always identify each other by the mind.
But, it’s nicer this way.
I know it sounds crazy, but it’s a … social thing … seeing a familiar face puts you at ease.
Oh, yes—she does!
And she gives me security.
That’s what I want to get at.
Tell me more about recognition.
You see, recognition depends on a person’s … feelings when you meet them here.
They will show you what they want you to see of themselves and what they think you want to see.
It also depends on the circumstances of your meeting with them.
Can you be more specific?
What different circumstances can cause energy forms to materialize in a certain way toward other spirits?
It is the difference between your being on their turf or your turf.
They may choose to show you one set of features in one place, while in another you might see something else.
Please tell me if I understand all this correctly.
The identity souls project to each other depends on timing and location in the spirit world as well as mood, and maybe psychological states of mind when they meet?
The image you project never hides who you really are from the rest of us.
Anyway, it’s not the same kind of emotion we know on Earth.
Here it is more … abstract.
Why we project certain features and thoughts … is based on a … confirmation of ideas.
Do you mean your sentiments at the time?
We mix it up.
You assume those features which the person you see will most recognize as you, depending on what you want to communicate.
But, why Jeff?
Was it just because he was you in your last life?
No, I felt good as Jeff.
It was a happy, uncomplicated life.
Damn, I looked great!
My face resembled those billboard smoking ads you used to see along the highway.
I enjoy showing off my handle-bar mustache as Jeff.
But that was only one life.
People not associated with you in that life may not recognize you here.
Oh, they would get it was me soon enough.
I could change to something else, but I like myself as Jeff the best right now.
Yeah, you see everyone as they truly are.
Some only want their best side to show because of what you might think of them—they don’t fully appreciate that it is what you are striving for which is important, not how you appear.
We get a lot of laughs about how spirits think they should look, even taking faces they never had on Earth, and that’s okay.
Yes, usually.
They can get stuck … we don’t judge … in the end they are going to be all right.
Are you kidding?
I don’t need my hand held anymore.
I know where I’m going and I’m anxious to get there.
I’m being pulled along by a magnet and I just enjoy the ride.
It’s easy.
They do it all for you.
Then you are not in control.
You don’t have the responsibility of finding your own destination.
You hear sounds?
Let’s go back to your statement about the radio.
Is your spiritual travel influenced by vibrational frequencies such as high, medium, and low resonance quality?
We have energy—within an energy field.
So, it isn’t just the lines we travel on … we generate energy ourselves … we can use these forces depending on our experience.
Yes, but not right here.
Later, when I am settled I can move around much more on my own.
Now, I’m being pulled and I’m supposed to go with it.
If we have a spirit world governed by order, with guides who care about us, how can maladaptive souls who exert negative energy upon incarnated beings be allowed to exist?
One explanation is that we still have free will, even in death.
We should first speculate if a soul can be considered culpable or guilt-free when it occupied the offending criminal brain?
Is the soul mind or human ego responsible, or are they the same?
Occasionally, a client will say to me, “I feel possessed by an inner force which tells me to do bad things.”
Does the extent of contemporary violence mean that we have more souls “going wrong” today than in the past?
If nothing else, our over-population and mind-altering drug culture should support this conclusion.
Is this belief true?
Are all souls given the opportunity to transmute back into the spirit world the same way, irrespective of their association with the bodies they occupied?
Does hell exist to permanently separate good souls from bad ones?
All my case work with the spirits of my subjects has convinced me there is no residence of terrible suffering for souls, except on Earth.
What do you know about this entity?
What happened after this soul returned to the spirit world following that life?
He … had hurt a girl … terribly … and did not rejoin our group.
There was extensive private study for him because he did so poorly while in that body.
Punishment is … a wrong interpretation … it’s regeneration.
You have to recognize this is a matter for your teacher.
The teachers are more strict with those who have been involved with cruelty.
No, he took what he had done … back into himself … he blamed his own lack of skill to overcome the human failings.
He asked to become an abused woman himself in the next life to gain understanding … to appreciate the damage he had done to the girl.
I’m propelled in and I see a bright warm beam.
It reaches out to me as a stream of liquid energy.
There is a … vapor-like … steam swirling around me at first … then gently touching my soul as if it were alive.
Then it is absorbed into me as fire and I am bathed and cleansed from my hurts.
I am alone, but it is directed.
My essence is being bathed … restoring me after my exposure to Earth.
After a lifetime of work.
It’s better and you don’t get wet, either.
By reaching into … my being.
I’m so tired from my last life and with the body I had.
My very expression—who I am as a being—was affected by the brain and body I occupied.
Each body leaves … an imprint … on you, at least for a while.
There are some bodies I have had that I can never get away from altogether.
Even though you are free of them you keep some of the outstanding memories of your bodies in certain lives.
I am suspended in the light … it permeates through my soul … washing out most of the negative viruses.
It allows me to let go of the bonds of my last life … bringing about my transformation so I can become whole again.
When I was younger and less experienced, I came here more damaged—the energy here seemed less effective because I didn’t know how to use it to completely purge the negativity.
I carried old wounds with me longer despite the healing energy.
So, what do you do now?
I wasn’t ready yet.
I just wanted to see my parents.
I … am going to have to make some kind of … accounting … of myself.
We go through this after all my lives, but this time I’m really in the soup.
It’s one of the nice things they do for you to ease your mind, but that’s where it ends.
Because I blew it!
I have to see him to explain why things didn’t work out.
Life is so hard!
I try to do it right … but …
I had an agreement with Clodees to work on setting goals and then following through.
He had expectations for me as Ross.
Now I have to face him with this …
No, I’m more upset with myself over what I did and didn’t do and he knows that.
Advisors can be displeased but they don’t humiliate us, they are too superior for that.
Ross, we both need to understand what is happening psychologically to you right from the start of your orientation with Clodees.
I want you to assist me.
Are you willing to do this?
Good, and now you are going to be able to do something unusual.
On the count of three, you will have the ability to assume the dual roles of Clodees and yourself.
This ability will enable you to speak to me about your thoughts and those of your guide as well.
It will seem that you will actually become your guide when I question you.
Are you ready?
Quickly now—be Ross Feldon again.
Move to the other side of the table and answer Clodees.
You are doing fine.
Keep switching chairs back and forth at the table.
Now answer your guide’s question.
Especially by women.
I observed you tried to dominate them sexually as well, making conquests without attachments.
Oh, but you do.
You must bring your self-awareness to bear on these matters.
This lacks merit and was unworthy of you.
What you became is not how you started.
We chose your parents carefully.
I was in debt when I began as a lawyer … ineffective … of no consequence.
I didn’t want to be poor anymore, defending people who couldn’t pay me.
I hated the farm—the pigs and the cows.
I liked being around substantial people and when I joined the establishment as a prosecutor, I had the idea of reforming the system and helping farm people.
It was the system that was wrong.
People had to pay fines they couldn’t afford—others I sent to jail because of offenses they didn’t mean to commit—others I had hung!
I became a legal killer.
What about the victims of the people you prosecuted?
Didn’t you choose a life of law to help society and to make the farms and the towns safer with justice?
This was not you.
Why did you hide from yourself?
What more would you have me do?
You didn’t reach far enough inside yourself.
I placed thoughts in your mind of temperance, moderation, responsibility, original goals, your parents’ love—you ignored these thoughts and were stubborn to alternative action.
That I had the desire to change things on Earth.
I started with wanting to make a difference for the people of Earth.
Then why did you take the body of such a strong, forceful woman in the twentieth century?
A surprise package?
What does that mean?
As a woman, I knew I would be less intimidating to men.
I can catch them off guard and scare them to death.
Let me understand your reason for choosing to be a woman in this life.
You wanted to help the same sort of people who you were unable to help as a man in your previous life—is this correct?
I’m doing it again.
Misusing people.
I chose the body of a woman who is intimidating to men and I don’t feel like a woman.
Sexually and in business.
I’m in the power game again … pushing aside principles … getting off track as before .
This time I manipulate real estate deals.
I’m too interested in acquiring money.
I want status.
The influence of money and position is a drug to me as it was in my last life.
My being a woman now has done nothing to change my desire to control people.
So … stupid …
Yes, I do feel more natural living as a man.
But I thought as a woman this time around I would be … more subtle.
I wanted this chance to try again in a different sex and Clodees let me take it.
What a blunder.
Don’t you think you are being a little hard on yourself, Hester?
I have the sense you also chose to be a woman because you wanted a woman’s insight and intuition to give you a different perspective to tackle your lessons.
You can have masculine energy, if you want to call it that, and still be feminine.
Would Hester have benefited from knowing about her past as Ross from birth rather than having to wait over thirty years and undergo hypnosis?
Having no conscious memory of our former existences is called amnesia.
Why should we have to grope around in life trying to figure out who we are and what we are supposed to do and wondering if some spiritual divinity really cares about us?
I closed my session with this woman by asking about her amnesia.
If people knew all about their past, many might pay too much attention to it rather than trying out new approaches to the same problem.
The new life must be … taken seriously.
We have … the capacity to know when it is necessary.
I was ready for change when I heard about you.
Clodees allowed me to see the past with you because it was to my benefit.
One—we are getting started.
Two—your soul has now moved out of the area of orientation.
Quickly, what is your first impression?
To be honest—from where I am floating—it looks endless.
But when I begin to really move it changes.
Well … everything remains … formless … but when I am … gliding faster … I see I’m moving around inside a gigantic bowl— turned upside down.
I don’t know where the rims of the bowl are, or even if any exist.
It’s strange.
Although everything appears to go on straight when my soul is drifting—that changes to … a feeling of roundness when I am moving fast on a line of contact.
Because with speed the lines seem to … bend.
They curve in a more obvious direction for me and give me less freedom of movement.
Other subjects, who are also disposed toward linear descriptions, speak of traveling along directional force lines which have the spatial properties of a grid system.
One person called them “vibrational strings.”
It’s just more purposeful—when my soul is being directed someplace on a line.
It’s like I’m in a current of white water—only not as thick as water—because the current is lighter than air.
We are gathered into … a sea … where all of us swirl around … in slow motion.
Then, I feel as though I’m being pulled away to a small tributary again and it’s quieter … further from the thoughts of so many minds … going to the ones I know.
No, not at all.
This is different.
We are like salmon going up to spawn—returning home.
Once we get there we are not pushed about this way.
Then we can drift.
Higher entities.
The ones in charge of our movements to get us home.
There is such peace you never want to leave again.
All right, now I want you to continue to move further along with the current of energy closer to the area where you are supposed to go.
Look around carefully and tell me what you see.
They are people.
The souls of people within the bulging galleries reflecting light outward to me.
That’s what I’m seeing—patches of lights bobbing around.
No, there are no walls here.
Nothing is structural, with angles and corners.
It’s hard for me to explain, exactly …
Now, I want you to tell me what separates the light clusters from each other along this corridor you are describing.
The people … are divided by … thin, wispy … filaments … making the light milky, like the transparency of frosted glass.
There is an incandescent glow from their energy as I pass by.
As light dots.
I see masses of dots hanging in clumps … as hanging grapes, all lit up.
Because … oh, good!
I’m coming in towards the site where my friends are attached.
Fantastic!
There is a familiar pulling of minds … reaching out to me … I’m catching the tail of their kite … joining them in thought … I’m home!
No one is really isolated, although some of the younger ones may think so.
I’ve been around a long time, though, and I have a lot of connections .
I do because of the connections I have had.
There is a oneness here.
Here no one is a stranger.
There is a total lack of hostility toward anyone.
We recognize a universal bond between us which makes us all the same.
There is no suspicion toward each other.
It is, for the newer ones especially, because they go to Earth expecting to be treated fairly.
When they aren’t, it’s a shock.
For some, it takes quite a few lives to get used to the earth body.
I would have to say yes, because the brain drives a lot of fear and violence into our souls.
It’s hard for us, but that’s why we come to Earth … to overcome …
That’s absolutely true.
We all want to return home.
Will you let me stop talking now, so I can meet with my friends?
I want to talk to you about your trip into the place where you normally stay in the spirit world.
Your soul is now moving toward this destination.
Explain what you see and feel.
I am … floating along … in a chain of some kind.
It’s as though I’m weaving through a series of … connecting links … a foggy maze … then … it opens up … oh!
Just relax—you are in the staging area now.
Do you still see your guide?
Continue to relax and remember you have been here before, although everything may seem new to you.
What do you do now?
It’s never black here … the light … just contracts to darker shades because of my speed.
When I slow down things get brighter.
I don’t know!
God, don’t they know I’m here?
I can’t reach my father!
Yes, those messages are coming through.
I have to work things out for myself … with others like me.
The directors encourage us … and my father is helping me understand, too.
All right, please continue with your passage from the moment you see some of your family in the distance.
What happens next?
Well, I’m still slowing down … moving gradually … I’m being taken along a course I have been on before.
I’m passing some other bunches of people .
Then, I stop.
It’s … large … activity … there are a lot of people in the vicinity.
Some are familiar to me, others are not.
You don’t understand!
I don’t go over there.
I’m not supposed to.
You can’t just go off anywhere.
It doesn’t matter.
This does sound wonderful.
Are these the same people who were involved with your past life?
More than one life, I can tell you.
These are my people!
Of course, yes, I have been with them for so long.
Oh, it’s fun seeing them all again.
I see quite a change in your understanding in just the short time since we arrived here.
Look off in the distance at the others around this space.
What is it like where they live?
I don’t want to know.
That is their business.
Can’t you see?
I’m not attached to them.
I’m too busy with the people I am supposed to be with here.
People I know and love.
I’m not sure.
I admit it was a shock at first.
Now I know the way things are.
It’s all coming back to me.
Probably other people you have known and loved besides your father are also in these groups.
Are you saying you have no contact with them now that you are in your proper place in the spirit world?
No, I have contact with my mind.
Why are you being so difficult?
I am supposed to stay here.
You don’t do that!
You don’t go into their groups and interfere with their energy.
At the right time.
When they are free to do this with me …
Yes, they are in their own spaces with instruction going on.
It’s the directors who move around mostly …
Thank you for clearing all this up for me.
You want me to know that you and your group friends are especially careful about infringing upon others’ spaces?
At least that’s the way things are around my space.
And what if you don’t?
Who decides what is the proper location for each group of souls?
Sometimes we do get lost—that’s our own fault—this place is big!
That’s why it never gets crowded.
Do all guides have the same teaching abilities, and does this affect the size of the group to which we are assigned in the spirit world?
The following passage is from the case file of an experienced soul who discussed this question with me.
I’m curious about teacher assignments in the spirit world in relation to their abilities to help undeveloped souls.
When souls progress as guides, are they given quite a few souls to work with?
They can handle it.
Size doesn’t matter.
Once you attain competency and success as a teacher, the number of souls you are given doesn’t matter.
I didn’t exactly say that.
The overseers.
Now, they are the real pros.
Then define for me why souls are selected as guides.
Take a typical guide and tell me what qualities that advanced soul possesses.
They must be compassionate without being too easy on you.
They aren’t judgmental.
You don’t have to do things their way.
They don’t restrain by imposing their values on you.
Okay, those are things guides don’t do.
If they don’t over-direct souls, what are the important things they do, as you see it?
We are accepted for who we are as individuals with the right to make our own mistakes.
Owa made his first appearance as a guide in my client’s past about 50 bc.
He was described as an old man living in a Judean village which had been overrun by Roman soldiers.
Abruptly, I asked if Owa might possibly be in her life now?
After a moment of hesitation, my subject began to shake uncontrollably.
Oh, Lord—I knew it!
I knew there was something different about him.
Owa is my son Brandon.
I knew it!
I felt it right from the day I delivered him—something wonderfully familiar and special to me—more than just a helpless baby … oh …
I didn’t really know—I felt it inside—something more than the excitement a mother feels at the time of her firstborn.
I felt he came here—to help me—don’t you see?
Oh, it’s so fantastic—it’s true— it’s him!
To get me through this bad time … with hard people who won’t accept me.
He must have known I was in for a long period of trouble and decided to come to me as my son.
We didn’t talk about doing this before I was born … what a wonderful surprise …
At the time of this session, my client was struggling to gain recognition in a highly competitive business.
I have since learned she is divorced.
Oh, what a blessing.
I wasn’t sure if I should even have the baby— now I see it all.
As I try to advance in my profession, people are getting … harder … not accepting what I know and can do.
My husband and I are having trouble.
He puts me down for pushing too hard … wanting to achieve.
Owa—Brandon—is here to keep me strong so I can overcome …
Do we ever catch up to our guides in development?
Eventually, perhaps, but I can say I have not seen any evidence of this in my cases.
Not the same as Quan—I can tell you.
Usually, he likes to … hide a little … at first … behind a shadow of … blue vapor.
I hear him chuckling before I see him.
Do you prosper with this technique of your advanced guide?
Has Giles been a help to your problem-solving during the game of life?
It doesn’t work that way here.
Besides, he is brilliant.
They choose you.
No, I don’t, but I consider myself very fortunate.
Quan … is gentle … and steady with her support.
I love Quan as a mother, but I wouldn’t be where I am without Giles’ discipline.
They are both skillful because they allow me to benefit from my mistakes.
What is the average spiritual guide like?
In my experience, no two guides are the same.
He said, “My guide is stonewalling me, she doesn’t give enough of herself.
Do we have reason to be fearful of our guides?
THERE are two types of beginner soulS: souls who are truly young in terms of exposure to an existence out of the spirit world, and souls who have been reincarnating on Earth for a long period of relative time, but still remain immature.
I find beginner souls of both types in Levels I and II.
That life was so cruel!
I couldn’t stay.
I was only a little girl unable to help anybody.
What a mistake!
My leader.
I trusted his judgment, but he was wrong to send me into that cruel life to be killed before my life got started.
I can’t believe it!
Ahmed is my husband Bill—the same person—how can …?
We search out what we think about ourselves—our experience on Earth.
I’m still sore about us being killed so soon … but there was happiness … walking in the sun … breathing the air of Earth … love.
Go back further to the time before you and Ahmed had your life together, perhaps when you were alone.
What was it like being created?
Keep to the time before Ahmed.
What was it like for you then?
I thought your leader displayed a male gender to you?
You know it!
I was so vain about clothes and I cut a really fine figure as an artist in Amsterdam cafe society.
I enjoyed this role and played it well.
I don’t want it to end.
My old friends are around me and we are talking about the foolishness of life.
We rib each other about how dramatic it all is down there on Earth and how seriously we all take our lives.
No, he is just the loudest.
We are all equal here, but we have our differences.
Norcross is blunt and opinionated.
Where did you get that idea?
Vilo comes up with some interesting thoughts about the rest of us.
That I should have done less drinking and strutting around and painted more.
That my art was … reaching the point of touching people … but I wasn’t going to stay cooped up painting all the time!
Yes, in Holland.
Engaged in a business for profit, I might add.
No … not really … we all know he took losses to help those poor people on the road who needed food and shelter.
His life was beneficial to others.
Oh … a couple have moved on … we will eventually catch up to them … but not for a while.
They haven’t disappeared—we just don’t see their energy as much.
Adventure!
Excitement!
We have some real pioneer types around here.
And what’s wrong with that?
Our group is not made up of shrinking violets, you know!
He was a Bishop!
Can you believe it?
What hypocrisy.
What self-deception!
Norcross, Dubri, and I tell Trinian his choice to be a churchman had nothing to do with goodness, charity, or spirituality.
That he is going soft.
Norcross tells him he wanted money or otherwise he would have been a simple priest.
Ha—that’s telling him— and I’m saying the same thing.
You can guess what Dubri thinks about all this!
Yes, but Norcross reproaches him.
He confronts Trinian on seducing a young girl in the vestry.
Yes, it actually happened!
… So much for providing solace to parishioners.
We know Trinian for who he really is—an outright rogue!
We think he is trying to follow Vilo , but he failed.
His pious intentions just didn’t work for him.
Allum, you sound rather cynical about Trinian’s attempts to improve himself and make changes.
Tell me honestly, how do you feel about Trinian?
So, what did I do?
I ran around the Amsterdam canals a lot at night and got caught up in the fun and games.
If you admit all this to the group, what kind of feedback do you get?
For example, how do you and Norcross regard each other?
Norcross often points out I hate to take responsibility for myself and others.
With Norcross it’s wealth … he loves power … but we are both selfish … except that I am more vain.
Neither of us gets many gold stars.
He enjoys controlling others by leadership.
He is a natural leader, more than the rest of us.
He was a sea captain—a pirate—one tough individual.
You wouldn’t want to cross him.
He did one outstanding thing.
Once, during heavy seas, a sailor fell off the mast into the ocean and was drowning.
Dubri tied a line around his waist and dove off the deck.
He risked his life and saved a shipmate.
We praise him for what he did with admiration in our minds.
We came to the same conclusion that none of us could match this single act of courage in our last lives.
Yet, Vilo’s life at the inn, feeding and housing people who could not pay him, may represent acts of unselfishness for a longer term and therefore is more praiseworthy?
Granted, and we give him that.
He gets more gold stars than Dubri.
Well, let me approach your feelings as a soul in another way.
Do you feel safer getting feedback from one of your group members more than another?
Yes … I feel sorry if I have hurt someone … and … then have everyone here know all about my mistakes.
But we learn.
We make cynical remarks, but it’s not like being human anymore.
Without our bodies we take criticism a little differently.
We see each other for who we are without resentment or jealousy.
Oh, that’s something else again.
Yes, we do get discouraged as souls, and feel unworthy about our abilities … to meet the confidence placed in us to improve.
Of course, but we want to be recognized by one another for being sincere in working on our individual programs.
Sometimes self-pride gets in the way and we use each other to move past this.
In the next passage of dialogue, I introduce another spiritual phenomenon relating to group healing.
I have heard a number of variations about this activity which are supported by the interpretations of Case 21.
Think carefully.
Isn’t there another means by which your group is brought into harmony with each other with intelligent energy?
Yes, the cones.
Explain what you know about them relative to your group.
Please continue, and tell me what the cone does.
I think I have heard about this before, but I want your version.
Shaped in what way?
Try to be more explicit.
It is cylindrical—very bright—it is above and all around us.
The cone is small at the top and wide at the bottom, so it fits over all of us—like getting under a great white cap—we can float under the cone in order to use it.
Oh no, that was more individual purification—to repair Earth damage.
I thought you knew …
I want you to explain how the cone is different from the shower of healing.
To be frank with you, Allum, I wonder if this cone is brainwashing your original thoughts?
After all, the arguments and disagreements between you and the others of your group are what make you individuals.
We aren’t brainwashed!
Don’t you know anything about the afterlife?
It gives us more collective insight to work together.
I think he is too busy traveling around on his circuit.
Oh, he probably gets bored with our lack of progress.
He loves to show off as the master of ceremonies though.
Shato appears in long, sapphire-blue robes with a tall, pointed hat.
With his flowing white beard he looks simply great, and we do admire him.
Is Shato indulgent with your group?
He doesn’t seem to limit your extravagance very much.
He will pop in unannounced to set up a problem for our discussions.
Then he leaves, coming back later to listen to how we might solve certain things …
He hits … on superficiality.
He is trying to get us to cast ourselves from the inside out, rather than the reverse.
Yeah, that’s why Shato is with us, I think.
He knows we waste opportunities.
He assists us in interpreting the predicaments we get into in order to get the best out of us.
Earth is an action planet which rewards physical exertion.
We are inclined to male roles so we can grab hold and mold events … to dominate our surroundings … to be recognized.
Women are also influential in society.
How can your group hope to progress without more experience in female roles?
We know this, but we have such a fierce desire to be independent.
In fact, we often expend too much energy for too little return, but the female aspects don’t interest us as much right now.
Well, someone had to bring those of you with the same attributes together.
Do you think it was God?
We aren’t that bad!
It’s just we are too closely connected by thought for an outsider, and they would not have shared our past experiences.
We want our presence in a community to challenge conventions— to question basic assumptions.
I think we bring nerve into our physical lives—and laughter, too …
Every time I leave for a new role on Earth, I say goodbye with, “See you all back here A.D. .”
I help Senji to forgive herself for mistakes and appreciate her own worth.
She needs to stop being a mother-figure all the time on Earth.
It isn’t that we can’t ask questions … but we can only question what we know.
Idis reveals to me what she thinks is relevant to my own experience.
Yes, and the intent of the question is important … when it was asked and why.
Perhaps it was not in their best interests to be given certain information which might disrupt them.
Don’t make too much of it.
I’m really no more than a caretaker … helping Idis and taking directions.
No, we are different.
As an apprentice—a caretaker—I couldn’t do what she is able to accomplish, anyway.
Yes, I picked a poor family in a rural community where I would be more indispensable.
I’m in a small mountain town.
I’m … taking care of my brother Billy.
His face and hands were horribly burned by a flash fire from a kitchen stove when he was four years old.
I was ten when it happened.
No, I’m a woman in Canada.
I’m Billy’s sister.
My mother and brother require someone mentally tough to hold the family together and give them a course to follow.
Why didn’t you take the role of your burned brother?
Wouldn’t that scenario provide you with the more difficult challenge?
Souls are not in a rigid bureaucratic environment.
We are allowed to make mistakes in judgement and learn from them.
Nenthum, I just have a couple more questions on the mechanics of soul-splitting.
All right, let’s start with the non-dimensional spheres.
Are these three areas in the spirit world for the use of souls?
I have heard of it, expressed in different ways.
Doesn’t it involve the beginners?
Yes, the newly created soul is there to learn who they are.
It’s the place of origin.
The new soul is not capable of choice.
You acquire your character based upon the way your energy is … combined … put together for you.
I think many factors are considered in the allocations of that which makes us who we are.
What I do know is, once given, ego becomes a covenant between oneself and the givers.
Yes, the new soul is pure energy with no real Self yet.
The World Without Ego provides you with a signature.
Because the newly created souls arrive with no ego.
The idea of Self has not come into the new soul’s consciousness.
It is here where the soul is offered meaning to its existence.
I want you to answer this next question carefully for me.
Planets don’t last forever.
Yes … but it’s not very clear at the moment.
They usually start you on an easy world or two, without much to do.
On some worlds you must overcome physical discomforts— even suffering.
Others lean toward mental contests.
Earth has both.
We get kudos for doing well on the hard worlds.
We are called the adventurous ones by those who don’t travel much.
That’s what appeals to me—mediating quarrels of a fallible race which has so much pride and need of self-respect.
The human brain is rather unique, you know.
But it’s evolving too, and when humans experience trouble, they can be at their best and are … quite noble.
They are opposites.
This world is not for young souls.
No, I’m not ready.
I am only aware of it as a place we strive for.
It is a place of contemplation … the ultimate mental world of planning and design.
I can tell you little about this sphere except it is the final destination of all thought.
The senses of all living things are coordinated here.
Yes, it’s about blending content with form—the rational with ideals.
It is a dimension where the realization of all our hopes and dreams is possible.
This sphere is available to all souls because it represents their own physical world.
In my case, it is Earth.
No, each of us studies our own geographical planet, where we incarnate.
They are physically real … temporarily.
To improve my decisions for life.
This study makes me more discriminating and prepares me for the World of All Knowing.
We haven’t talked about the World of Creation and Non-creation.
This must be the three-dimensional physical world you spoke of earlier.
No, it is not.
I’m just starting to apply myself there.
No, it is a little different.
It’s larger and somewhat colder.
There is less water—fewer oceans, but similar.
Would you say the galaxy containing this physical world is shaped like a spiral as our galaxy, or is it elliptical?
How would it look in a telescope from a long way off?
That’s just what we don’t want to do there.
Because intelligent energy is arranged by … a precedence of life.
Plants, insects, reptiles—each is in a family of souls.
The maker’s energy joins the units of every living thing in existence.
Those of us who are connected with Earth come here.
This is a vacation spot compared to Earth.
There is no fighting, bickering, or striving for supremacy.
There is a pristine atmosphere and all life is … quiet.
This place gives us an incentive to return to Earth and make it more peaceful, too.
We can experiment with creation and see it developing here.
It’s as if you were in a lab where you can form physical things from your energy.
Yes, only on Earth.
That’s why I am here.
Since this subject is experiencing resistance, I take a few minutes for reconditioning and end with the following: “On the count of three you will feel more relaxed about telling me what you and Idis consider appropriate for my knowledge.
One, two, three!” I repeat my question.
I look to see what I am supposed to make on the ground in front of me.
Then I mold the object in my mind and try and create the same thing with small doses of energy.
The teachers assist us with … control.
I’m supposed to see my mistakes and make corrections.
Try to be as clear as possible.
What exactly are you doing?
I’m not ready for that yet.
I experiment with the basic elements— you know, hydrogen and oxygen—to create planetary substance … rocks, air, water … keeping everything very small.
I want to understand this clearly.
Your work consists of learning to create by causing heat, pressure, and cooling from your energy flow?
No, like I told you, my job is to transform things by … mixing what I am given.
I play with the frequency and dosages of my energy— it’s tricky, but not too complicated …
Not complicated!
I thought nature did those things?
Hmm … it’s more our trying to copy what we see in front of us … what we know.
I’m getting into plants … but I can’t do them yet.
We copy things and compare them against the original so we can make larger models.
We are children.
Directing an energy flow resembles the sculpturing of clay.
Most come from all over , but they have all incarnated on Earth.
Well, of course, some of us are better with certain things, but we help each other.
The teachers come around and give us tips and advice on how to improve … but …
Is this what you mean by uncreation?
You can destroy energy?
Energy can’t be destroyed.
We reassemble it and start over using different combinations.
For our benefit.
No, you are wrong.
It is not a pyramid.
We are all threads in the same long piece of fabric.
We are all woven into it.
Most of the souls on Earth are in one car moving along the track.
The maker?
Up front, naturally.
No, but I can smell the smoke.
I can feel the engine rumbling along and I can hear the motor.
Describe to me what happens to you now.
Stay with it!
You are alone and moving faster.
Keep going and report back to me.
Keep going!
Don’t stop talking to me.
Me—I play!
It’s a fine time to leave and purely goof off … when the baby is less active.
Oh, lighten up!
Who said anything about long periods?
I don’t do that!
Anyway, our tough exercises haven’t begun yet.
We never force ourselves when entering an unborn baby.
My tracing is done carefully.
That’s their style, not mine.
Why is no other living thing on Earth concerned with life after death?
Is this simply because our inflated egos hate to think of life as only temporary, or is it because our being is associated with a higher power?
People argue that any thoughts of a hereafter are wishful thinking.
If the souls who go to planets in our universe are the offspring of a parent oversoul who is made wiser by our struggle, then could we have a more divine grandparent who is the absolute God?
The concept that our immediate God is still evolving as we are takes nothing away from an ultimate source of perfection who spawned our God.
With the help of the Buddha’s teachings and the practice of mindfulness, the greatest change I have made in myself, I think, is that I can easily forgive people now, no matter what they do, and believe me, this skill didn’t come easily!
I had to work long and hard at it.
“Why do you want to rehash these old problems?
It can only cause trouble.”
Small Treasure
Why start with yourself?
some people ask.
Isn’t that terribly selfish?
To love yourself before anyone else?
Wish your enemies well?
Hope for their success, when they’re going after the same promotion you want?
Send them peaceful thoughts when they’ve just insulted your child or cut in front of you in traffic?
The teacher walked along the rows of students and looked at our teeth and fingernails to make sure they were clean.
Everything had to be neat, including our clothes.
And some days, we did just that!
My mother, ever vigilant, would scream at the top of her lungs as soon as we set foot in the water, and we would reluctantly climb out.
The monk’s procession was accompanied by drum-beating, conch-blowing, flute-playing, and loud calls of “Sadhu!
Sadhu!” which means, “Excellent!
Excellent!
Excellent!”
The Homeless Life
My mother cried because she hated to see me leave home, but she saw in my determination that it was inevitable — my birth horoscope had even predicted it!
And my mother was certainly not the only mother in Ceylon to give her youngest son to the religious life; because Buddhism was so pervasive in our culture, this happened all the time.
I was given a little cushion and told to sit among the other monks, though not too close!
I sat, and a small parade of laypeople came forward, each one bowing and laying a small present before me.
“But what should I do to you if I catch you doing this again?
You tell me.”
Hinnimahattaya got very upset and let loose a string of filthy words.
I beat him up.
I bet my one rupee and immediately won two more!
I was hooked.
Suddenly I saw an object flying toward me — the alms bowl from the shrine room!
My teacher was so upset that he had thrown the bowl at me before even asking why it was still full.
I could think of no solution except to run away again, but where to?
I knew I could no longer go home.
“Don’t you remember what our teacher did to us?
All these monks are alike.
“Ukkubanda, since you can’t walk very fast, why don’t I go ahead with this man?
You take your time and walk as slow as you need.
A Monk Once Again
He swam over to me, took hold of my ears, and pulled my head out of the water — ouch!
But he wasn’t strong enough to pull the rest of my body above the surface.
Monks’ School
A shaved head promotes cleanliness and humility and it avoids the problem of having to kill head lice!
It is also a symbol of renunciation and is intended to decrease monks’ and nuns’ attachment to physical beauty.
Standing behind him, I dragged the blade against his scalp and an inch-long flap of skin lifted away from his skull!
In the next instant there was blood everywhere.
Higher Ordination
And I am not even listed here as one of your teachers.”
How I wished she could have witnessed this ceremony!
I knew how much it would have meant to her, how much it would have meant to me to have her there.
How can you separate your body, or your self-image, from your mind?
It’s impossible.
How can you say that?
Scientifically, it’s impossible that the world can change so radically.
Who is right?
How do you explain that scientifically?
It’s just their individual mind’s projection of the sense world.
How can you be satisfied by even vast amounts of material objects?
How will sleeping with hundreds of different people satisfy you?
It will never happen.
That’s so simple, isn’t it?
You don’t have to believe in something.
Don’t believe anything!
All the same, you can’t say, “I don’t believe I have a mind.”
But can you reject yourself?
Can you deny your head, your nose?
You cannot deny your mind.
What, then, is satisfaction?
Go through all this mentally and check; it’s very important.
Your mind has changed so many times but have you reached any conclusion as to what really makes you happy?
My interpretation is that you are lost.
Why are you here?
To be well liked?
To become famous?
To accumulate possessions?
To be attractive to others?
How do you check your mind?
Just watch how it perceives or interprets any object that it encounters.
Is all this very new for you?
Do you think that examining the mind is only for those who are on an Eastern trip?
Don’t think that way.
How do you check up on your own mind?
How do you do it?
If you can’t trust your mind to make a decision, can you leave it to something outside?
Like telling yourself, “If such and such happens, I’ll go here; if something else happens, I’ll go there.
Yesterday something happened in your mind; today you experience the effect.
You’re asking me about my purpose in life?
That’s something for me to check for myself, but if I had to reply, I’d say my purpose is to dedicate myself as much as I possibly can to the welfare of others, while trying to be of benefit to myself as well.
Is the mind different from the soul?
When you speak of solving the problems of the mind, do you mean that the mind is the problem and not the soul?.
But you shouldn’t ask emotionally, Oh, what’s that, what’s that, what’s that?
I have to find out; I have to know.
Why will you get answers?
Because your basic nature is wisdom.
Are there exceptions to that rule?
I’ve seen posters for one spiritual leader where it says, I, at whose feet all people bow.
Lama Yeshe, how do you go about treating mental illness?
How do you help people with mental illness?
How do you help people understand their problems?
How do you go about it?
How do you do that?
How do you teach somebody to check?
I have to ask myself, “Why do I feel good about this person?
What makes me feel this way?” By investigating this I might find that it’s just because he was nice to me once, or that there’s some other similar small, illogical reason.
When they understand the psychology I teach, they think, “Ridiculous!
I’ve always blamed society, but actually the real problem has been inside of me all along” .
“Oh, I have a problem with him.
If I get rid of him I’ll solve my problems” .
How much time do you spend talking with that person to find out about his problem and how to deal with it?
As you know, in Western psychiatry, we spend a great deal of time with patients to help them discover the nature of their problems for themselves
Because the basic problem is within our minds.
How do we lose touch with our own nature?
Why does it happen?.
You might feel that materially your life is perfect, but you can still ask yourself, “Does this really satisfy me?
Is this all there is?” You can check your mind, “Where does satisfaction really come from?” If you understand that satisfaction does not depend only on external things, you can enjoy both material possessions and peace of mind.
Lama, do you solve people’s problems by getting them to withdraw into meditation or cut themselves off from the outside world?
Is this the way you treat people?
What sort of time are you talking about?
Anybody can come.
Why are we here?
What is our reason for living?
But where am I going?
Do I have to go anywhere?
And what happens then?
Do we reincarnate?
Do we live in order to continually improve ourselves?
When you’re an old man, will you be better than you are now?
But the real question we have to ask of any method is can it really put a complete stop to human problems for ever?
Actually, Lord Buddha himself taught an amazing variety of psychological remedies to a vast range of problems.
Where did the very first moment of anger come from?
The anger that left imprint after imprint after imprint?
Dr. Gold: Well, Lama, thank you very much for coming and visiting with us.
It’s been very, very interesting.
Perhaps you’re thinking, “Oh, how can he say that?
We all see the same face, the same body, the same clothes,” but that’s just a superficial interpretation.
What exists without mind?
Look at all the stuff you find in supermarkets: so many names, so many foods, so many different things.
You don’t want to be a poor quality human being, do you?
To correct your view and become a better person, you don’t need to squeeze yourself or to jump from your own culture into another.
How are we different?
We all have mind; we all perceive things through our senses; we are all equal in wanting to enjoy the sense world; and equally we all grasp at the sense world, knowing neither the reality of our inner world nor that of the outer one.
Because the human mind is like an ocean and we’re very similar to each other in the way we’ve evolved on this earth.
Isn’t that so simple?
You don’t have to believe in anything.
Then whose view of the mountain is correct?
If you can answer that, you can reply to your own question.
What in the external world is perfect?
So since the energy of your mind and body are inextricably bound up with the external world, how can you expect your life to go perfectly?
You can’t.
What is morality?
Morality is the wisdom that understands the nature of the mind.
Why does this happen?
Because of the limited nature of material phenomena: when their power is exhausted, they collapse, like the old and crumbling buildings we see around us.
In your nose?
Your head?
Your lung?
Your heart?
Your stomach?
Where is that feeling of satisfaction?
In your leg?
Your brain?.
It’s in your mind.
If you say it’s in your brain, why can’t you say it’s in your nose or your leg?
Why do you differentiate?
If your leg hurts, you feel it down there, not inside your head.
How, then, is he a good husband?
Even if he does provide food and clothing for his wife, how can he be a good husband, when day after day she has to live with his arrogance?.
Because you perceive it?
Do you perceive this rosary [holding it up]?
Does that make it mind?
When you get angry and see red, is that color internal or external?
Think about it
Because even though philosophically they’re incorrect, they still teach the basic morality of being a good human being and not harming others
As far as you know, what is life like for people in Tibet these days?
Are they free to pursue their Buddhist religion as before?
I’m joking!
No, that’s impossible
Since our minds can deceive us, and without a teacher we can’t discover the truth, are Buddhist monasteries designed so that each monk pulls his colleagues up to the next step of knowledge, in a sort of chain?
Is that what you’re doing now, and do you teach in order to learn?
that’s the catch: if you have enough wisdom
Why do you need an English teacher?
For communication
How can you give up your mind?
I’m joking
Do lamas ever become physically ill, and if so, what method do you use to overcome the illness?
Do you use healing power?
Do you know what that is?
Some people think it’s just ritual chanting and bell ringing, but it’s much more than that
Will it go on being able to save the world?
The question cannot be answered.
“And why,” asks Eckhart, “why do you prate of God?
Whatever you say of God is untrue.”
“When you quote theBhagavad Gita, or the Bible, or some Chinese Sacred Book, surely you are merely repeating, are you not?
And what you are repeating is not the truth.
If you respond as a Catholic or a Communist, you are responding—are you not?—according to a patterned thought.
Therefore your response has no significance.
And has not the Hindu, the Mussulman, the Buddhist, the Christian created this problem?
As the new religion is the worship of the State, so the old religion was the worship of an idea.”
But, it may be asked, “What are you doing?
Are you not acting as our guru?” “Surely,” Krishnamurti answers, “I am not acting as your guru, because, first of all, I am not giving you any gratification.
What is it precisely that Krishnamurti offers?
What is it that we can take if we wish, but in all probability shall prefer to leave?
It is not, as we have seen, a system of beliefs, a catalogue of dogmas, a set of ready-made notions and ideals.
Is it, perhaps, self-discipline?
No; for self-discipline is not, as a matter of brute fact, the way in which our problem can be solved.
Can it be, then, that what he offers is prayer?
Again, the reply is in the negative.
By constant repetition of certain phrases, and by controlling your thoughts, the mind becomes quiet, doesn’t it?
At least, the conscious mind becomes quiet.
But what makes you choose?
“What makes you say this is good, true, noble, and the rest is not?
Obviously the choice is based on pleasure, reward or achievement; or it is merely a reaction of one’s conditioning or tradition.
Why do you choose at all?
Why not examine every thought?
When you are interested in the many, why choose one?
Why not examine every interest?
Instead of creating resistance, why not go into each interest as it arises, and not merely concentrate on one idea, one interest?
After all, you are made up of many interests, you have many masks, consciously and unconsciously.
You may be right, and I may be wrong; but by listening and considering together we are going to find out what is the truth.
Truth cannot be given to you by somebody.
Is it not possible, then, to be aware of everything as it is?
Starting from there, surely, there can be an understanding.
Being aware of this confusion, what is our response to-day?
How do we react?
But what we are trying to do is to understand this confusion and not cover it up with quotations; so what is your response to it?
How do you respond to this extraordinary chaos, this confusion, this uncertainty of existence?
Be aware of it, as I discuss it: follow, not my words, but the thought which is active in you.
Haven’t you noticed it?
When there is confusion in the world, psychologically and in every way, you enclose yourself in some kind of security, either that of a bank account or that of an ideology; or else you turn to prayer, you go to the temple—which is really escaping from what is happening in the world.
What is the cause of it?
Surely it indicates the collapse of all moral, spiritual values, and the glorification of all sensual values, of the value of things made by the hand or by the mind.
The more significance we give to the sensual value of things, the greater the confusion, is it not?
Again, this is not my theory.
Can we stop this misery at once, and not go on always being caught by the wave of confusion and sorrow?
That is, great teachers, whether the Buddha or the Christ, have come; they have accepted faith, making themselves, perhaps, free from confusion and sorrow.
But you and I can perceive the confusion and misery immediately, can we not?
We must perceive them, and then we shall be in a position to awaken the same understanding of truth in another.
Now is it possible to come to that state when you yourself perceive the truth instantaneously and therefore put an end to confusion?
I say that it is, and that it is the only possible way.
Is it not, therefore, an obvious fact that what I am in my relationship to another creates society and that, without radically transforming myself, there can be no transformation of the essential function of society?
When we look to a system for the transformation of society, we are merely evading the question, because a system cannot transform man; man always transforms the system, which history shows.
When there is love there is action, is there not?
, and is that action not liberating?
How many beliefs we have!
Surely the more intellectual, the more cultured, the more spiritual, if I can use that word, a person is, the less is his capacity to understand.
Look how we worship those who have immense knowledge and erudition!
Can you understand the meaning of it?
Most of us think that possessing very little indicates freedom from desire—and how we worship those who have but few things!
A loin-cloth, a robe, symbolizes our desire to be free from desire; but that again is a very superficial reaction.
You know how you worship those who are intellectually superior, the lawyers, the professors, the orators, the great writers, the explainers and the expounders!
You have cultivated the intellect and the mind.
The implication is, what can be substituted for nationalism?
Any substitution is an act which does not bring intelligence.
How does nationalism go?
Only by our understanding its full implications, by examining it, by being aware of its significance in outward and inward action.
When you put that question to yourself, “Why do I suffer?
”, and are looking for the cause of suffering, are you not escaping from suffering?
How absurd!
Or the world is too much for me, I want peace and I go home.
If once we really felt the responsibility of our own actions, how quickly we could bring to an end all these wars, this appalling misery!
But you see, we are indifferent.
Because you have nothing else to do, therefore you become a reformer!
If you have nothing to do, if you are bored, why not be bored?
Krishnamurti: Surely there is a vast difference, is there not?
Surrendering to the will of God implies that you already know the will of God.
To understand something, to understand what is you cannot be distracted, can you?
If I want to understand what you are saying I cannot listen to music, to the noise of people outside, I must give my whole attention to it.
If I am arrogant, what happens?
If I do not name arrogance, it ceases; which means that in the problem itself is the answer and not away from it.
Now what do we mean by prayer?
First of all, in prayer there is petition, supplication to what you call God, reality.
Can the immeasurable, the unutterable, be concerned with our petty little worries, miseries, confusions, which we ourselves have created?
Therefore what is it that answers?
Obviously the immeasurable cannot answer the measured, the petty, the small.
But what is it that answers?
At the moment when we pray we are fairly silent, in a state of receptivity; then our own subconscious brings a momentary clarity.
Again, how can it be the voice of reality?
A mind that is confused, ignorant, craving, demanding, petitioning, how can it understand reality?
The mind can receive reality only when it is absolutely still, not demanding, not craving, not longing, not asking, whether for yourself, for the nation or for another.
That is what you do, is it not?
When you sit down to meditate, you fix your mind on a word, on an image, or on a picture but the mind wanders all over the place.
Surely that is not meditation, is it?
Meditation is not an exclusive process—exclusive in the sense of warding off, building resistance against encroaching ideas.
What is meditation?
Concentration is not meditation, because where there is interest it is comparatively easy to concentrate on something.
So what is meditation?
Surely meditation is understanding—meditation of the heart is understanding.
How can there be understanding if there is exclusion?
How can there be understanding when there is petition, supplication?
In understanding there is peace, there is freedom; that which you understand, from that you are liberated.
What, then, do we mean by understanding?
Understanding means giving right significance, right valuation, to all things.
And how is one to establish right values—the right value of property, the right value of relationship, the right value of ideas?
For the right values to come into being, you must understand the thinker, must you not?
If I don’t understand the thinker, which is myself, what I choose has no meaning; that is if I don’t know myself, then my action, my thought, has no foundation whatsoever.
You are addressing mainly the conscious mind and is that enough?
Will your method bring about release of the unconscious?
Please explain in detail how one can tackle the unconscious mind fully.
Is the conscious mind different from the unconscious mind?
We have divided the conscious from the unconscious; is this justified?
Is this true?
Is there such a division between the conscious and the unconscious?
Is there a definite barrier, a line where the conscious ends and the unconscious begins?
We are aware that the upper layer, the conscious mind, is active but is that the only instrument that is active throughout the day?
If I were addressing merely the upper layer of the mind, then surely what I am saying would be valueless, it would have no meaning.
Therefore, our problem is this, is it not?
There is in fact only one state, not two states such as the conscious and the unconscious; there is only a state of being, which is consciousness, though you may divide it as the conscious and the unconscious.
How is it possible for the mind to be free?
To be free, the mind must not only see and understand its pendulum-like swing between the past and the future but also be aware of the interval between thoughts.
Krishnamurti: Why is it that whatever we touch we turn into a problem?
We have made God a problem, we have made love a problem, we have made relationship, living a problem, and we have made sex a problem.
Why is everything we do a problem, a horror?
Why are we suffering?
Why has sex become a problem?
Why do we submit to living with problems, why do we not put an end to them?
Why do we not die to our problems instead of carrying them day after day, year after year?
Sex is certainly a relevant question but there is the primary question, why do we make life into a problem?
Working, sex, earning money, thinking, feeling, experiencing—you know, the whole business of living—why is it a problem?
What do we mean by the problem of sex?
Is it the act, or is it a thought about the act?
Surely it is not the act.
Is the sexual act the problem or is it the thought about the act?
Why do you think about it?
Why do you build it up, which you are obviously doing?
The cinemas, the magazines, the stories, the way women dress, everything is building up your thought of sex.
Why does the mind build it up, why does the mind think about sex at all?
Why has it become a central issue in your life?
When there are so many things calling, demanding your attention, you give complete attention to the thought of sex.
What happens, why are your minds so occupied with it?
Because that is a way of ultimate escape, is it not?
It is a way of complete self-forgetfulness.
That is there is only one act in which there is no emphasis on the ‘me’, so it becomes a problem, does it not?
When there is only one thing in your life which is an avenue to ultimate escape, to complete forgetfulness of yourself if only for a few seconds, you cling to it because that is the only moment in which you are happy.
How can the two exist together?
Your life is a contradiction; emphasis on the ‘me’ and forgetting the ‘me’.
